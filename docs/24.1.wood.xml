          <p>It has become increasingly apparent that sources for Blake’s designs may be located in various
areas of the popular print market. David Bindman has shown that certain images used by Blake may be related to
eighteenth-century children’s emblem books, to seventeenth-century anti-papal engravings, and to
eighteenth-century hieroglyphic prints.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n68"
type="note">1</ref> David Erdman has demonstrated that the political satires of James Gillray exerted an
influence on some of Blake’s work.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n69" type="note">2</ref>
Gillray was, however, by far the best trained and most talented of the political caricaturists working in
London from the late eighteenth century until the onset of his insanity in 1810. His work stands above the
technically inferior prints of lesser contemporaries such as Isaac Cruikshank, George Moutard Woodward, and
Richard Newton. Up to this point the cruder types of political etching have not been put forward as an
influence on the work of Blake. The striking parallels between a print of Newton’s entitled “The Birth of
Billy Bugaboo” (illus. 1), which came out on 13 August 1797, and Blake’s illustration “The Dog”
(illus. 2), which was the first plate in the 1805 edition of Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>, suggest
that in this instance Blake was influenced by a very coarse political print of the day.<supplied

          <p>The parallel is particularly interesting because Nicholas Warner has already suggested two other
“visual analogues” for this particular Blake print.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n71"
type="note">4</ref> The second of Warner’s examples, Gillray’s “The Republican Rattlesnake Fascinating
the Bedford Squirrel” came out on 16 November 1795.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n72"
type="note">5</ref> The Gillray has enough similarities with the Newton print to suggest that Newton may have
adapted major compositional elements from the earlier print. The Newton print does, however, anticipate both
the composition
<pb id="p24-248" n="248"/>
and imagery of the Blake illustration much more precisely than the Gillray. <note id="n71"><hi rend="s">4</hi>

          <p>“The Birth of Billy Bugaboo” is an example of the scatological extremes that were permitted
in the print satire of the late eighteenth century. Its formal control and clarity of line is typical of the
print satires which Newton executed just before his death at the surprisingly early age of twenty-one. A devil
standing on the brink of a sheer cliff, naked except for a pair of slippers, gleefully excretes an absurdly
elongated figure of Pitt into mid air. He flies down towards the open and extended arms of Henry Dundas, which
reach up from the treasury roof. The heads and upper bodies of Sheridan and Fox are visible in the bottom left
hand corner. They hold their noses and gaze at the obscene birth as Fox exclaims, “What a stinking breath he
has got Sherry.” The print attacks Pitt’s policies of taxation. It is a visual actualization of the
phrase, “Hell born Minister,” the inscription on an earlier placard that enjoyed great
popularity.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n73" type="note">6</ref> Both these satires were
directed at the title of “Heaven born Minister” which had been bestowed on Pitt by his supporters. 
<note id="n73"><hi rend="s">6</hi> See George’s discussion of the background to print 9029.</note></p>
          <p>Every major element in this print, with the exception of the figures of Fox and Sheridan, found
its way into Blake’s design. Blake appears to have reversed the composition, the diagonal thrust moving from
top left to bottom right. It should be remembered, however, that the printing process reversed the imagery, so
that Blake’s actual engraving on the plate would have followed the arrangement of the earlier print. The
devil runs away from the edge of the cliff, not towards it, but the position of his legs, his tilted head, and
his nudity all reappear in the figure of Edward, the young man, in Blake’s print. The gesture of Edward’s
arms extended in horror has been transferred from the figure of Pitt. Blake adapted Dundas’s open arms into
the jaws of the crocodile, and the horizontal treasury roof has been changed into the ocean. The dog flying
headlong downwards, with open mouth and spread forelegs, takes the place of Pitt. The sheer cliff face, which
extends to half way up the earlier design, has also been maintained by Blake, who has given it a dramatic
overhang.</p>
          <p>Critical responses to the illustration are revealing in the light of this source. Blake’s plate
was singled out for ridicule by Robert Southey in his generally dismissive review of the 1805 edition of
Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>:
<q>
Mediocrity as all the world knows, is forbidden to poets and to punsters; but the punster has a privilege
peculiar to himself,—the exceeding badness of his puns is imputed a merit. This privilege may be fairly
extended to Mr. Haley: his present volume is so incomparably absurd that no merit within his reach could have
amused us half so much . . . The poet has had the singular good fortune to meet with a painter capable of
doing full justice to his conceptions; and in fact when we look at the delectable frontispiece to this volume
which represents Edward starting back, fido volant, and the crocodile rampant, with a mouth open like a
boot-jack to receive him, we know not whether most to admire the genius of Mr. William Blake or of Mr. William
Hayley.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n74" type="note">7</ref>
	<note id="n74"><hi rend="s">7</hi><hi rend="i"> Annual Review</hi> 4 (1806): 575.</note></q>
The designs were considered more enthusiastically by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, when he wrote to his friend
William Allingham in 1856, yet he also singled out the plate for “The Dog”: “The only drawing where the
comic element riots almost unrebuked is the one of the dog jumping down the crocodile.”<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n75" type="note">8</ref>
	<note id="n75"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Dante Gabriel Rossetti, 8 Jan. 1856, Letter 227 of <hi rend="i">Letters of
D. G. Rossetti</hi>, ed. O. Doughty and J. R. Wahl, 4 vols. (Oxford, 1969) 1: 279.</note></p>
          <p>It is fascinating that both Southey and Rossetti should have detected a note of comic absurdity
in this plate. Although they were not aware that its composition came out of an obscene popular print, their
reactions perhaps indicate the extent to which the satiric fervor and outrageous fantasy of Newton’s work
were absorbed, consciously or otherwise, into Blake’s design.</p>
