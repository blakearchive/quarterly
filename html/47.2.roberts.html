<p class="title">William Blake’s Visionary Landscape near Felpham</p>
<p class="byline">By Jonathan Roberts</p>
<p class="note"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Jonathan Roberts</span> (<a href="mailto:roberts@liv.ac.uk">roberts@liv.ac.uk</a>) is senior lecturer in the School of English, University of Liverpool.</p>
</div>
<div id="text">
<p style="margin-top: 30px">Perhaps the most striking account of a 
religious vision that Blake offers is a poem enclosed in an 1800 letter 
to his friend and patron Thomas Butts. This rare moment of 
autobiographical verse, usually referred to by its first line, “To my 
Friend Butts,” describes Blake’s vision on the beach at Felpham. The 
poem is well known beyond Blake studies, as it occurs more frequently in
 anthologies of mysticism than any other passage from his work (with the
 possible exception of the opening lines of “Auguries of Innocence”). 
Yet within Blake studies it has received comparatively little scholarly 
attention. This may be due in part to its anomalous character, something
 that it shares with another work from the same period and place: 
Blake’s pencil and watercolor sketch <em>Landscape near Felpham</em>. I 
argue below that there is a significant and demonstrable relationship 
between these two works, and that this connection offers a valuable 
resource for reflection on our treatment of the relationship between the
 material and the transcendent in our discussion of Blake.</p>
<p>My argument will be in three parts. Part I connects “To my Friend 
Butts” to its biographical and biblical contexts and shows the ways in 
which it is in dialogue with Butts’s own overlooked poem to Blake. Part 
II provides a detailed analysis of <em>Landscape near Felpham</em>, 
establishing Blake’s position and perspective when making the sketch, 
demonstrating its visual accuracy, then dating it by relating its 
minutiae (foliage, tide, weather, and so on) to historical records. I 
thereby show that although they are not usually linked, the poem and the
 sketch were probably made on the same morning, on the shore at Felpham 
on one of the days leading up to Thursday, 2 October 1800. Part III 
looks at the broader correspondence of the period, in which Blake draws 
on Genesis 28 (Jacob’s ladder) to negotiate his new life situation, and I
 use his watercolor of that story to reflect on the poem to Butts and 
the Felpham sketch. I then connect the vision of God/Jesus at Felpham to
 its surprising reappearance as a vision of Satan in <em>Milton</em>. I 
conclude by reflecting on these different elements and by suggesting 
that the popular and academic reception of Blake’s religion is at odds 
with the hermeneutic of his Christological “fourfold vision.”<br>
<br>
</p><p class="strong">I. “To my Friend Butts”</p>
<p><span class="notecall">Blake’s three-year</span><span class="sidenote">From September 1800 to September 1803; his subsequent trial was held in Chichester on 11 January 1804 (see Bentley, <em>Blake Records</em> 179).</span>
 stay at Felpham has long been considered a turning point in his life, 
through disillusionment, depression, the incident with Schofield the 
soldier, <span class="notecall">and through what Jean H. Hagstrum called
 a “genuine conversion” whereby “anger, energy, action” impelled him to 
“become once again the dedicated artist-prophet.”</span><span class="sidenote">Hagstrum 322.</span>
 Blake and his wife, Catherine, moved from their London home to Felpham 
on Thursday, 18 September 1800. On 23 September Blake sent a letter to 
Butts recounting the “chearfulness &amp; welcome” of the journey, the 
beautiful countryside, glorious weather, and, in some detail, the 
excellence of their cottage. The villagers, air, wind, trees, and birds 
are all mentioned, and in the days following their arrival Blake’s wife 
and sister, <span class="notecall">conscious of the fashion for bathing at nearby Bognor,</span><span class="sidenote">Blake to George Cumberland, 1 Sept. 1800 (Bentley, <em>Blake Records</em>
 95-96). Alternatively, they may have been prompted by William Hayley: 
Catherine had “Exhausted her strength” (Blake to Hayley, 16 Sept. 1800 
[E 709]), and Hayley, on “any and every occasion, … would ‘plunge into 
the ocean’, and he would, moreover, encourage others to plunge. What is 
more, he would thus plunge at periods which, to our softer ideas, seem 
positively inhumane. October bathing, for instance, was nothing to him” 
(Bishop 96). Bognor would later become Bognor Regis when George V went 
there to convalesce in 1929, as it was thought that the sea air would, 
likewise, be good for his health (see, for example, &lt;﻿<a href="http://www.bognorregis.gov.uk/" target="_blank">http://​www.​bognorregis.​gov.​uk</a>﻿&gt;, under “History”).</span> had already visited the seashore <span class="notecall">“courting Neptune for an Embrace.”</span><span class="sidenote">Blake to Butts, 23 Sept. 1800 (E 711).</span>
 Butts replied within a week with a letter that Basil De Selincourt 
rightly describes as “a cordial, jocular epistle,” adding, however, that
 it is <span class="notecall">“in not too perfect taste,”</span><span class="sidenote">De Selincourt 274.</span>
 presumably due to Butts’s preoccupation with imagining Mrs. Blake in 
the heated embraces of Blake, of Neptune, and of Butts himself. Butts 
writes:
</p><blockquote>I am well pleased with your pleasures, feeling no small 
interest in your Happiness, and it cannot fail to be highly gratifying 
to me and my affectionate Partner to know that a Corner of your Mansion 
of Peace is asylumed to Her, &amp; when invalided &amp; rendered unfit 
for service who shall say she may not be quarter’d on your Cot—but for 
the present she is for active Duty and satisfied with requesting that if
 there is a Snug Berth unoccupied in any Chamber of your warm Heart, 
that her Portrait may be suspended there, at the same time well aware 
that you, like me, prefer the Original to the Copy. Your good Wife will 
permit, &amp; I hope may benefit from, the Embraces of Neptune, but she 
will presently distinguish betwixt the warmth of his Embraces &amp; 
yours, &amp; court the former with caution. I suppose you do not admit 
of a third in that concern, or I would offer her mine even at this 
distance. Allow me before I draw a Veil over this interesting Subject to
 lament the frailty of the fairest Sex, for who alas! of us, my good 
Friend, could have thought …<br><br>
<span class="notecall"><span style="padding-left: 50px">So Virtuous a Woman would ever have fled</span><br>
<span style="padding-left: 50px">from Hercules Buildings to Neptune’s Bed?</span></span><span class="sidenote">Hercules
 Buildings was the Blakes’ residence in London. Butts returns to the 
image at the end of the letter: “Mrs Butts greets your Wife &amp; 
charming Sister with a holy Kiss and I, with old Neptune, bestow my 
Embraces there also” (Butts to Blake, Sept. 1800 [<em>Letters</em> 25-27]).</span></blockquote>
The couplet is the finale to Butts’s struggling attempt to stage-manage 
the sustained innuendo concerning Mrs. Blake; he is more at ease with 
the metaphors drawn from his job as chief clerk to the commissary 
general of musters.
<p>Alongside this giggly flirtation, Butts includes a well-meant poem 
blessing Blake and Catherine, wishing them long life and visions, and 
imagining their ascent, after death, to heaven:
</p><blockquote>Happy, happy, happy Pair,<br>
On Earth, in Sea, or eke in Air,<br>
In morn, at noon, &amp; thro’ the Night<br>
From Visions fair receiving light,<br>
Long may ye live, your Guardians’ Care,<br>
And when ye die may not a Hair<br>
Fall to the lot of Demons black,<br>
Be singed by Fire, or heard to crack,<br>
But may your faithful Spirit upward bear<br>
Your gentle Souls to Him whose care<br>
Is ever sure and ever nigh<br>
Those who on Providence rely,<br>
And in his Paradise above<br>
Where all is Beauty, Truth &amp; Love,<br>
O May ye be allowed to chuse<br>
For your firm Friend a Heaven-born Muse,<br>
From purest Fountains sip delight,<br>
Be cloathed in Glory burning bright,<br>
For ever blest, for ever free,<br>
<span class="notecall">The loveliest Blossoms on Life’s Tree.</span><span class="sidenote"><em>Letters</em> 26-27.</span></blockquote>
These are strange images to communicate to a friend, because by hoping 
that Blake’s and Catherine’s bodies will not singe or crack in demonic 
fires, Butts has imagined that very scenario. <span class="notecall">G. 
E. Bentley, Jr., who has contributed so much to our knowledge of Butts, 
depicts him as a “white collar Maecenas” who, in “the grey years when 
reputation and even employment were hidden to Blake, … befriended and 
supported perhaps the most independent and extraordinary genius that 
ever offered wisdom for sale in the empty market place where none come 
to buy.”</span><span class="sidenote">Bentley, “Thomas Butts, White Collar Maecenas” 1066.</span>
 The homily is entirely justified, but, like Wordsworth’s epitaphic 
paradigm of “truth hallowed by love—the joint offspring of the worth of 
the dead and the affections of the living” (<em>Essays upon Epitaphs</em>),
 it can occlude intriguing aspects of Butts’s character. In particular, 
it is interesting to ponder what enabled Butts—unlike so many 
contemporaries—to recognize the genius of Blake’s work. <span class="notecall">It may well be that in this one surviving letter from Butts</span><span class="sidenote">The original is not extant; Butts, however, retained the draft and kept it with the letters he received from Blake (<em>Letters</em>
 27n1). It is, as Bentley puts it, “an undated draft which begins in a 
beautiful, clerkly copperplate hand and degenerates, through many 
deletions … to hasty pencil at the end … later darkened in ink” (<em>Blake Records</em> 102fn).</span>
 we have an answer: he himself had a barely containable imagination that
 even in a single correspondence is entertaining a ménage à trois with 
his friends, their consummation in hellfire, and their ascent into 
heaven.
<p>Blake’s reply of 2 October, like Butts’s original, mixes humor with 
seriousness, reflecting the contractual relationship between the two 
men, the literary aspirations of each (they both enclose poems), their 
fondness for each other and each other’s wives, and the desire that they
 have to impress one another. <span class="notecall">As Bentley puts it,

friendship and cordiality, with every sign of having been established 
for some time.”</span><span class="sidenote">Bentley, “Thomas Butts, White Collar Maecenas” 1055.</span> The exchange is reciprocal: Butts, who would later buy a copy of <em>Songs</em>,
 may well be nodding to “The Tyger” in his line “cloathed in Glory 
burning bright,” while Blake’s gentle, jovial reply in turn picks up 
images and ideas from Butts’s letter, with Blake describing himself as 
“the determined advocate of Religion &amp; Humility”—tongue in cheek, I 
suspect—<span class="notecall">in response to what Bentley calls the “somewhat fulsome moral advice” offered by Butts.</span><span class="sidenote">Bentley, “Thomas Butts, White Collar Maecenas” 1055.</span>
 After mentioning settling into the new cottage and apologizing for not 
having completed Butts’s recent commissions, Blake offers his “return of
 verses” that constitute the poem “To my Friend Butts.” The poem 
describes Blake’s “first Vision of Light” while sitting on the sands at 
Felpham. Gazing at the sea, he sees the particles of the sun’s light 
revealed as human forms—“Heavenly Men”—who beckon to him and illuminate 
the human reality of all natural phenomena (“Cloud Meteor &amp; Star / 
Are Men Seen Afar”). Approaching—or perhaps following—them, Blake finds 
himself looking down upon the village from above, seeing “Felpham sweet /
 <em>Beneath</em> my bright feet” (emphasis mine), sensing there the 
“Shadows” of himself, his wife, sister, and friend, and reflecting that 
we “like Infants descend / … on Earth.” The heavenly men eventually 
coalesce as one divine man, who enfolds Blake to his bosom. The poem 
ends, and without further comment, Blake’s letter returns to the matter 
of commissions, the cottage, the weather, and so on, before concluding 
with a second, much shorter verse, addressed to Mrs. Butts. The poem and
 the containing letter are <a href="#appendix">appended</a> to this article, but the section of the poem that is most commonly anthologized is the opening:
</p><blockquote><menu class="verse"><li>To my Friend Butts I write</li>

The less frequently quoted ascent into the divine bosom that follows is described in this way:
<blockquote><menu class="verse2"><li>I stood in the Streams</li>

<p><span class="notecall">This unique lyric vision offers a poetic 
report of a personal religious epiphany in a specific locale, which took
 place, presumably, in the days immediately preceding the composition of
 the letter.</span><span class="sidenote">The poem picks up imagery from
 Butts’s letter, which, although undated, must have been written between
 24 September (after receipt of Blake’s, postmarked 23 September) and 30
 September (to have been delivered in time for Blake to have composed a 
reply by 2 October); see also Bentley, <em>Blake Records</em> 102fn.</span>
 The poem owes its first-person, loco-descriptive character, so unusual 
in Blake, to its occurrence halfway through a letter to a friend. It has
 other notable features too: it refers to the poet’s wife, sister, and 
friend, and the catalyst to the vision is an experience of the natural 
world. All these are characteristics that we might expect of, say, a 
conversation poem, and in the wider romantic context, none of them is 
unusual. We are quite used to this sort of setup in the work of other 
poets of the period (Wordsworth’s “Lines Written a Few Miles above 
Tintern Abbey” and Coleridge’s “The Eolian Harp” are obvious examples). 
In Blake, however, it is a rarity. Elsewhere, we have many reports of 
Blake’s visions; individuals such as Henry Crabb Robinson and Alexander 
Gilchrist recount tales about the boy Blake’s being terrified by God 
poking his head in at a window or delighted by finding angels up a tree.
 But as a firsthand, to-the-moment account of being caught up into 
heaven from Felpham and looking down at the village from above, this 
poem is unique among Blake’s writings. Moreover, the first-person 
narrative voice is different from that of the Blake to whom quotations 
are often attributed, for this is neither the voice of the devil, nor a 
song of innocence, nor the dramatized narrator of one of the prophecies.
 It was not written for publication, but is more like the semi-private 
effusion of Wordsworth’s “Distressful gift! this Book receives.” Its 
intimate character gives it a special place in his oeuvre, and, 
consistent with the letter in which it is found, its privacy and 
inwardness show us things less often seen in Blake.</p>
<p>Our understanding of “To my Friend Butts” may be enhanced by 
considering its companion piece, the rarely discussed poem for Mrs. 
Butts that Blake encloses in the same letter. “M<sup>rs</sup> Butts,” he writes, “will Excuse the following lines”:
</p><blockquote>Wife of the Friend of those I most revere.<br>
Recieve this tribute from a Harp sincere<br>
Go on in Virtuous Seed sowing on Mold<br>
Of Human Vegetation &amp; Behold<br>
Your Harvest Springing to Eternal life<br>
Parent of Youthful Minds &amp; happy Wife</blockquote>
One way to read this overlooked poem is as a disarming of Butts’s bit of
 innuendo. Declining to sustain the banter about embracing Neptune, 
Blake instead writes a rather chaste verse about Mrs. Butts, reasserting
 her proper place as the wife of his revered friend. With that 
established, he is able to praise her <span class="notecall">pedagogical,</span><span class="sidenote">“Betsy
 [Butts] had a boarding school for girls at 9 Great Marlborough Street 
at which Blake may have taught and which was decorated with his 
drawings” (Bentley, <em>Blake Records</em> 90).</span> maternal, and matriarchal fruitfulness—all this in the language of fertility—<span class="notecall">without turning his verse to her body or sexuality.</span><span class="sidenote">A
 final note on the tenor of the poem. Blake, perhaps unsurprisingly 
given his new setting—by the sea and cornfields—uses images of water and
 of harvest. The mention of “Springing to Eternal life” echoes John 4.14
 (“whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never 
thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of 
water springing up into everlasting life”). Likewise, the invocation to 
“Go on in Virtuous Seed sowing … / … &amp; Behold / Your Harvest 
Springing to Eternal life” evokes numerous New Testament passages, not 
least the parable of the sower in Matthew 13.2-9, a passage that—with a 
wonderful appropriateness given the context—is immediately preceded by 
the line “The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea 
side.” <span style="display: block; text-indent: 15px">All quotations from the Bible are from the Authorized (King James) Version.</span></span>
 This response may provide a helpful cue for thinking about how “To my 
Friend Butts” is responding to Butts’s “Happy … Pair.” Butts’s poem is 
surprisingly carnal in its imagined burning of his friends’ flesh, and 
just as Blake’s verse to Mrs. Butts seeks to limit the sexual life of 
his friend’s letter, so “To my Friend Butts” may likewise be 
neutralizing the apocalyptic elements of Butts’s vision by bringing that
 vision out of the future into the present and out of heaven and hell 
back to Felpham. There may be both an element of good-humored visionary 
one-upmanship here and a practical demonstration by Blake of what vision
 is. <span class="notecall">There is also, though it goes against the 
grain of a widely cherished image of Blake, a unique instance of the 
great champion of unfettered imagination and supposed advocate of free 
love attempting to tone down and rein in the fantasies of his patron and
 friend.</span><span class="sidenote">Even Val, the renegade of Marilyn French’s <em>The Women’s Room</em>,
 who “saw the whole world in terms of” sex, “used to say that only Blake
 had known what the world was really about” and “read Blake at night: 
the book lay always on her bedside table” (chapter 16).
<span style="display: block; text-indent: 15px">The situation is only 
complicated by (i) Blake’s later (1809) picture of the whore of Babylon,
 which bears a striking resemblance to Mrs. Butts, although Bentley 
decides this “must be coincidental” (caption to pl. 75, <em>The Stranger from Paradise</em>),
 and (ii) the romantic overtones of Blake’s “The Phoenix to Mrs Butts.” 
Joseph Viscomi notes that perhaps “it is not a coincidence that the 
couplets of Blake’s other verses have three or five beats to the line, 
whereas those of ‘The Phoenix’ have four, the same number of accents as 
in the couplets of Thomas Butts’s poem to Blake.” Moreover, he says that
 “Mr. Butts also wrote Blake a poem, included in a September 1800 
letter, explicitly acknowledging his affection for Catherine Blake and 
Blake’s affection for Mrs. Butts—acknowledgments not without double 
entendres” (Viscomi 15). The affection that Viscomi mentions is 
expressed in the letter rather than the poem.</span></span> What is 
certain is that the two poems are in dialogue, and that our 
understanding of “To my Friend Butts” can be deepened through 
consideration of its response to the narrative and imagery of Butts’s 
“Happy … Pair.”
<p>This dialogue is especially evident in the shared religious (and 
specifically biblical) imagery that the two men deploy, which both 
provides common ground and marks out their differences. <span class="notecall">Butts’s
 poem uses the second person in an imagined future and draws on the book
 of Revelation to narrate his hope that after their deaths the Blakes 
will ascend to heaven</span><span class="sidenote">He uses “Paradise 
above” rather than “heaven,” but the synonymity is clear from the other 
details and has biblical precedents in, for example, the crucifixion 
narrative of Luke 23.42-43: “And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me 
when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say
 unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.”</span> and be 
united with God. The narrative structure—judgment and burning, ascent 
and glory—also echoes the final chapters of the New Testament, in which 
the casting of the devil into the lake of fire and brimstone in chapter 
20 is followed by the description of the new heaven and earth in 
chapters 21 and 22. <span class="notecall">The picture of heaven that 
Butts unfolds, in which the Blakes will from “purest Fountains sip 
delight” and become the “loveliest Blossoms on Life’s Tree,” appears to 
be drawn from the crystal-clear river and tree of life of Revelation 
22.1-2.</span><span class="sidenote">“And he shewed me a pure river of 
water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and
 of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of 
the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of 
fruits ….”</span> Likewise, Butts’s hope that the Blakes will be 
“cloathed in Glory” may relate to the martyrs in Revelation 6.9-11, who 
are given “white robes,” which also feature in Revelation 7.9-17. <span class="notecall">He may also be drawing on 1 Corinthians 15 at this point,</span><span class="sidenote">“For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality” (1 Corinthians 15.53).</span>
 a discussion in which Paul, like Butts, is emphatically concerned with 
death and resurrection, kinds of glory, and being clothed anew. Blake, 
by contrast, works with a different paradigm of the transformation being
 wrought on the individual, as he presents not new clothing in his poem,
 but a bodily union with the “One Man” who enfolds his limbs. <span class="notecall">Blake, like Butts, has biblical precedents here,</span><span class="sidenote">For
 example, Philippians 3.20-21, in which Jesus “shall change our vile 
body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.”</span> but 
his account has a freshness and intimacy with the divine, in comparison 
with which Butts’s offer of a future encounter with a God <span class="notecall">“known by his Attributes”</span><span class="sidenote">“Him
 whose care / Is ever sure and ever nigh / Those who on Providence 
rely”; the quotation in the text is from Blake’s critique of Newton’s 
vision of God in <em>The Everlasting Gospel</em> (E 519).</span> seems 
like an ideal in a picture book. This shift epitomizes the way in which 
Blake’s poem fulfills or reimagines the hopes of Butts’s verse: Butts 
wishes Blake “Visions fair receiving light,” and Blake responds with his
 own “first Vision of Light”; Butts hopes that after death Blake’s soul 
will be borne up to heaven, and Blake responds with a full-blown account
 of how this has already happened, being taken up into God’s bosom as a 
present reality, not as an imagined afterlife. Butts concludes by 
wishing that the Blakes will from “purest Fountains sip delight”; Blake 
closes by recounting how he “saw you [Butts] &amp; your wife / By the 
fountains of Life.” In sum, Blake reclaims Butts’s narrative by 
retelling it in the present, in the first person, and by offering an 
immediate, earthly realization of the eschatological promises of Butts’s
 poem. <span class="notecall">This is a marked contrast from Butts’s 
vision because, for Blake, our place in heaven does not have to come at 
the expense of our place in the world.</span><span class="sidenote">I will return to this continuity of the eternal and the everyday when discussing the relationship of the poem to the sketch.</span></p>
<p><span class="notecall">Acknowledgment of this biblical dialogue is important because it has largely been lost in the reception history of the poem.</span><span class="sidenote">The
 poem occasionally appears in scholarly publications, but is usually 
discussed in passing, often in the demonstration of some larger theory 
of Blake’s work (see, for example, Frye 42). Kathleen Raine picks it up 
in a footnote in <em>Blake and Tradition</em>, linking Blake’s imagery of the “One Man” (line 51) to the work of Swedenborg, speculating that Blake may have read Newton’s <em>Opticks</em>
 during his residence at Felpham, and noting that the particles of light
 (line 19) have Newtonian resonances (Raine 1: 420-22). In one of the 
few sustained discussions of the poem, Donald Ault’s <em>Visionary Physics</em> relates these resonances to Blake’s theory of fourfold vision, a theme also discussed by David Wells in <em>A Study of William Blake’s Letters</em>. De Selincourt provides some helpful observations on the poem in <em>William Blake</em>,
 and Stephen D. Cox, who looks at the visionary logic of the poem, 
suggests it is “the clearest, least mediated, literary record we have of
 a Blakean vision” (Cox 31). In <em>Symbol and Truth in Blake’s Myth</em>,
 Leopold Damrosch, Jr., provides perhaps the fullest reading of the poem
 as the testimony of a biographical event and attempts to analyze the 
kind of experience that Blake is recounting. My earlier discussion of 
the biblical imagery of “To my Friend Butts” is in <em>Blake. Wordsworth. Religion.</em> 75-80.</span> “To my Friend Butts” has remained a staple of popular anthologies of mystical verse over the last century, from <em>The Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse</em> (1917) to <em>Poetry for the Spirit</em> (2002), and, as the title of the latter suggests, <span class="notecall">has been widely admired in what might be called new-age publications.</span><span class="sidenote">See, for example, the 1963 article in the <em>Theosophist </em>journal,
 which quotes the poem and then comments, “To know ourselves fully as 
the One Heavenly Man is the goal of our return journey. On the outward 
journey, the Monad through the Ego discovers the circumference, the 
not-Self, the many. On the return journey he rediscovers that the many 
are the One” (Galloway 92).</span> This has been facilitated by the abridgment of the second half of the poem, <span class="notecall">an abridgment that foregrounds the generic mystical features</span><span class="sidenote">I mean the sorts of characteristics categorized by William James (see James 329).</span> while obscuring the biblical dialogue that is taking place. <span class="notecall">Recovering this dialogue enriches and clarifies the meanings of the poem,</span><span class="sidenote">As Robert N. Essick and Viscomi write about <em>Milton</em>, “much of the code of <em>Milton</em> remains obscure unless we attend to the Bible” (Essick and Viscomi 13).</span> as two instances will demonstrate. First, Blake’s ascent above Felpham. <span class="notecall">Appearing
 initially in the third-person stories of Enoch (Genesis 5.24) and 
Elijah (2 Kings 2.11), accounts of being taken in vision up into heaven 
are given in the first person by Ezekiel, Paul the Apostle, and John of 
Patmos.</span><span class="sidenote">For a fuller discussion of Blake’s 
interest in Enoch and the ascent of Enoch through the palaces of heaven 
in 1 Enoch, see Rowland.</span> <span class="notecall">Ezekiel, for example, is lifted up by the spirit and taken into vision,</span><span class="sidenote">“And
 he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; 
and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and 
brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem” (Ezekiel 8.3).</span> and <span class="notecall">Paul and John record comparable experiences in 2 Corinthians</span><span class="sidenote">“I
 will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. I knew a man in 
Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or
 whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one 
caught up to the third heaven. And I knew … how that he was caught up 
into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a
 man to utter” (2 Corinthians 12.1-4).</span> and in <span class="notecall">Revelation.</span><span class="sidenote">“After
 this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first 
voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which 
said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be 
hereafter. And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne 
was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne” (Revelation 4.1-2).</span>
 Blake’s poem participates in this tradition, sharing the elements of 
being taken up into heaven or paradise and hearing God speak, then 
returning to earth to report the news.</p>
<p>Second, the union with (and identity of) the “One Man.” <span class="notecall">Geoffrey Keynes is only partially right in his assumption that this is “Los, the Spirit of Prophecy.”</span><a nmae="31" id="31"></a><span class="sidenote">See <em>Letters</em> 29n1. Keynes derives this from Sloss and Wallis. I will discuss the connection to Los more closely (with reference to <em>Milton</em>) in the final section.</span>
 The “One Man” often appears in Blake’s work, whether as the “Universal 
Family” (E 180, 311), “Universal Humanity” (E 377), or as Jesus (E 116, 
143). In “To my Friend Butts” the extensive biblical allusions make the 
identification clear, for although God and Jesus are not explicitly 
named, there are numerous associations. The “One Man,” like God and 
Jesus, <span class="notecall">is figured as a shepherd</span><span class="sidenote">See, for example, Psalms 23.1 and John 10.11.</span> <span class="notecall">(he refers twice to the earth as his “Fold,” and addresses Blake as his “Ram”).</span><a name="33" id="33"></a><span class="sidenote">The language of mountain, sea, wolf, and sheep in the poem is also found in Isaiah 11, which anticipates the Messiah.</span>
 Blake’s encounter with him is, moreover, personal and intimate: Blake 
rests in his “bosom” just as Lazarus rests in the bosom of Abraham (Luke
 16.22) and as the beloved disciple rests in the bosom of Jesus at the 
Last Supper (John 13.23). The passage itself has a baptismal character, 
as Blake’s “mire” and “clay” are “Like dross purgd away,” and the 
central vision of light reflects visionary encounters with God and Jesus
 found throughout the Bible. <span class="notecall">The visions of Ezekiel, Paul, and John mentioned above are likewise all associated with light;</span><span class="sidenote">The
 spirit that lifts Ezekiel is “a likeness as the appearance of fire: 
from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins
 even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber” 
(Ezekiel 8.2). During Paul’s conversion near Damascus “suddenly there 
shined round about him a light from heaven” (Acts 9.3), and Jesus 
Christ, who appears to John, is described in these words: “His head and 
his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a
 flame of fire” (Revelation 1.14).</span> Moses’s encounter with God 
leaves his face shining (Exodus 34.29ff.), an image recapitulated in the
 transfiguration of Jesus, whose “face did shine as the sun” and whose 
“raiment was white as the light” (Matthew 17.2), and by Blake in the 
preface to <em>Milton</em>, which asks (about Jesus) “did the Countenance Divine, / Shine forth upon our clouded hills?” (E 95). <span class="notecall">The association of Jesus with light is also central to the Gospel of John.</span><span class="sidenote">“In
 the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
 God. … In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the 
light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. … That 
was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world”
 (John 1.1-9).</span></p>
<p>In sum, “To my Friend Butts” is suffused with biblical imagery, and 
that imagery is not limited to the poetic moment but is part of a wider 
discussion that carries through into Blake’s correspondence of this 
period. In part III I will be extending this discussion to look at the 
central organizational metaphor of this poem and of Blake’s wider 
correspondence, before relating it to Blake’s contemporary sketch <em>Landscape near Felpham</em>, to which I now turn.<br>

<p><em>Landscape near Felpham</em> (illus. 1) is a sketch in pencil with
 a watercolor wash. It depicts the view toward Felpham from the south, 
looking across cornfields to (from left to right) <span class="notecall">White Mill and an outbuilding,</span><span class="sidenote">This
 was perhaps the largest smock mill ever built in Sussex (a smock mill 
is typically wooden, tapered, and hexagonal or octagonal in plan). See 
Blythman 45. Including the cap and two-storey base, it appears to have 
been seven storeys tall.</span> the tower and church of St. Mary the Virgin, Hayley’s new villa, the Turret (later known as Turret House), and, to the right, <span class="notecall">the Blakes’ cottage.</span><span class="sidenote">The identification is made in Butlin 1: 313 (#368).</span>
 The sketch is faint, but the mill, trees, tower, church, and cottage 
are all quite clear. Some details are less obvious. The rough 
brushstrokes in the foreground represent the sea, and there is the most 
elementary boat to the right, with a large oblong shape over it that is 
difficult to make out: it might represent a cow grazing, or possibly a 
shrub (at the bottom right of this unpainted rectangle is a pencil 
detail that could depict either an animal’s legs or the stems of a 
plant). In the left foreground there is vegetation on the shoreline. A 
fence runs across the field, and a little right of center is a rider on a
 horse (riding right to left). Between the rider and the mill two 
figures, perhaps, stand against the fence. On the right of the field, 
and slightly more distant, might be another figure or animal. There are 
clouds and sunshine, with rays of light falling on the cottage. The 
pencil elements of the sketch are naturalistic and attentive to detail: 
the original winding device of the mill and the abat-son (although not 
the crenellation) of the church tower, for example, are both visible.</p>
<p>The Felpham sketch is, in some respects, Blake’s most ordinary picture, prompting Raymond Lister to write that the scene <span class="notecall">“amply
 demonstrates what the main body of his work has led some to doubt, that
 he was capable of painting straightforward landscapes.”</span><span class="sidenote">Lister pl. 25.</span> Blake, as far as we know, rarely sketched his surroundings. <span class="notecall">The
 examples that we do have are principally of Hayley’s previous house, at
 Eartham, and appear to have been made for the latter’s records.</span><span class="sidenote">In
 Butlin there are a number of sketches from c. 1801 that were probably 
made on the same day as one another when Blake visited Eartham (see 1: 
313-14, #369-73).</span> Yet the oddness of this “straightforward” 
romantic landscape sketch only really becomes apparent against the wider
 backdrop of Blake’s visual art. In the 1990s, the Blake room at the 
Tate was dominated by the great color prints that include <em>Elohim Creating Adam</em>, <em>The Good and Evil Angels</em>, <em>Newton</em>, and <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em>, and the temperas of <em>The Spiritual Form of Nelson Guiding Leviathan</em> and <em>The Ghost of a Flea</em>. Then—in a sudden departure from this apocalyptic cosmos—there was <em>Landscape near Felpham</em>.
 It is a work that seems to step out of Blake’s mythological world and 
into his everyday life, and like the letter and poem to Butts, it is a 
private work that discloses a rarely seen side of his character and art.
 Certainly by the end of the decade, Blake would not have hung the 
Felpham sketch in an exhibition. <span class="notecall">The very different kind of public artist that he later wished to be is clear from the 1809 catalogue of his “Exhibition of <em>Paintings in Fresco</em>, Poetical and Historical Inventions.”</span><span class="sidenote">For
 example, “if Art is the glory of a Nation, if Genius and Inspiration 
are the great Origin and Bond of Society, the distinction my Works have 
obtained from those who best understand such things, calls for my 
Exhibition as the greatest of Duties to my Country” (E 528). See also 
David Blayney Brown and Martin Myrone’s discussion in “William Blake’s 
1809 Exhibition.”</span></p>
<p>The central similarity between “To my Friend Butts” and <em>Landscape near Felpham</em>
 is an obvious one: both describe an experience on the beach at Felpham.
 Moreover, the relationship of the sketch to Blake’s wider visual oeuvre
 is similar to the relationship of the poem to his wider literary 
oeuvre: both offer an atypical first-person account of a local scene, 
and both forego the characteristic polemical and dramatic elements of 
Blake’s art. <span class="notecall">Put in these terms, one might expect the two to have been linked critically, yet they have not.</span><span class="sidenote">Although
 the poem and sketch have long been recognized as works from 
approximately the same place and time, their apparent experiential 
disparity seems to have discouraged critical investigation of their 
actual connection. So, for example, when discussing the sketch, Lister 
(pl. 25) does quote part of the poem, but does not suggest that the two 
may represent the same moment. Butlin writes that it is “tempting to see
 this watercolour as Blake’s first reaction to the prospect that opened 
up with his move to Felpham,” and quotes the letter to Flaxman 
concerning “Celestial inhabitants” (see <a href="#24">paragraph 24</a>, below), but takes this intuition no further (1: 313). I discuss the connection between the sketch and poem in <em>Blake. Wordsworth. Religion.</em> 7-15 and 34-36.</span> So what historical evidence is there that the sketch and poem are two sides of the same coin?</p>
<p>Given the first-person character of these pieces, it is worth 
beginning with Blake’s location: where was he when he made the sketch, 
and when did he make it? Frederick Tatham, who vouchsafed the picture, 
added “subject not known. perhaps near Felpham”; in fact, there is no 
question of the location, as this is certainly Felpham itself, the 
village seen from a viewpoint that can be located to within a few 
meters. The scene can no longer be viewed, not only because the mill and
 turret no longer exist, but because of the extensive twentieth-century 
housing that now fills the landscape. Nonetheless, the four fixed points
 in the sketch—the mill, the church, the turret, and the cottage—<span class="notecall">are visible on the first edition of the Ordnance Survey County Series map,</span><span class="sidenote">Ordnance
 Survey County Series 1:2500, 1st ed. (1854–1901), “Sussex County.” The 
layout of Turret House can be established from surviving architectural 
plans and pictures; see Crosby, “The Sketch on the Verso of Blake’s 
Self-Portrait: An Identification.”</span> and their coordinates can be cross-referenced with modern satellite imagery such as that provided by <a href="http://www.google.com/earth/index.html" target="_blank"><em>Google Earth</em></a>. <span class="notecall">The exact positions of the buildings can thereby be established,</span><span class="sidenote">Mill: 50.785652, -0.654725; church: 50.790731, -0.654655; turret: 50.790617,<br> -0.652571; cottage: 50.788670, -0.652510. These coordinates can be pasted directly into the search bar of <em>Google Earth</em>.</span> <span class="notecall">as can the distances between them,</span><span class="sidenote">Mill–church: 560.7 m; mill–turret: 572.8 m; mill–cottage: 362.7 m; church–turret: 149 m; church–cottage: 272.5 m.</span> and this information can be related to their relative positions within the sketch itself. <span class="notecall">Blake’s position when drawing the sketch can then be estimated using triangulation.</span><span class="sidenote">We
 imagine Blake standing facing the scene he is painting, with his 
sketchbook in front of him. Visual angles between landmarks in the scene
 will be represented as distances between them on his canvas. Although 
we can’t know the scale of this representation, given three landmarks we
 can look for locations where the relative angles between adjacent pairs
 of landmarks are in the same proportions as those Blake has depicted. 
This leads to an equation whose solution is a one-dimensional curve on 
the map. In the painting there are four prominent landmarks, so that we 
have two such curves, and we conclude that Blake was standing where 
these curves intersect. There is only one such point from which the 
landmarks would also be in the same order, left to right, as in Blake’s 
painting.</span></p>
<p>So where was Blake standing (or sitting)? The main evidence comes 
from the sketch itself: in the foreground are waves and a boat, 
suggesting that Blake himself must have been in a boat, a little out to 
sea, when he drew the scene. Further out from the shore Felpham beach 
slopes very gradually; close to the shoreline it shelves steeply, as can
 be seen in <a href="#illus2">illus. 2</a>, yet Blake has a high eyeline
 on the scene before him. There are numerous groynes on the beach, but 
(again, as illus. 2 shows) these would still not provide sufficient 
elevation for the given eyeline. This suggests that the sketch must have
 been made at full tide—anything less would have provided insufficient 
elevation—and indeed the tide appears full in the image. <span class="notecall">Blake’s approximate position, triangulated from the sketch,</span><span class="sidenote">50.785471, -0.654257.</span>
 is a little out to sea, although this evidence is only suggestive, as 
early nineteenth-century maps of the scene lack detail of the shoreline,
 and the shore has eroded substantially since 1800, <span class="notecall">eventually taking the mill with it.</span><span class="sidenote">Blythman 44. The erosion is quite evident when the Ordnance Survey map is overlaid on a modern satellite image of Felpham.</span>
 Although the mill was dismantled in 1879, there are a number of 
surviving images of the building from the nineteenth century. The 
erosion of the shore can be seen in illus. 2 (Percy Thomas’s 1878 
etching), and the sheer size of the mill can be seen by looking at the 
human figures in <a href="#illus3">illus. 3</a>.</p>

What these images offer is a perhaps unique opportunity to establish the
 facility and accuracy with which Blake was able to draw 
three-dimensional architectural objects from life. Of particular

<span class="notecall">Illus. 3 provides an interesting contrast to illus. 4, in which Blake’s depiction of his cottage in <em>Milton</em> (pl. 36) is juxtaposed with an early twentieth-century photograph.</span><span class="sidenote">The similarities between the cottage in <em>Landscape near Felpham</em> and the <em>Milton</em> image have been noted by Butlin (1: 313); see also the 1979 photograph of Allen Ginsberg wielding the <em>Milton</em> image in front of the cottage &lt;﻿<a href="http://www.allenginsberg.org/index.php?page=blake-s-cottage-at-felpham" target="_blank">http://​www.​allenginsberg.​org/​index.php?page=blake-s-cottage-at-felpham</a>﻿&gt;.

The <em>Milton</em> cottage is presumably drawn from memory at a later date, <span class="notecall">and is naive compared to the simple, confident, and accurate lines of the mill.</span><span class="sidenote"><em>Landscape near Felpham</em> and <em>Milton</em> are in different media; nonetheless, the proportions of the mill appear to be much more accurate than those of the cottage.</span>
 This difference is also evident in the detail of the waves and the boat
 in the Felpham sketch. The picture is unfinished, but the waves bear 
little resemblance to the surface of any sea, and the boat, which looks 
unlike any contemporary (or seaworthy) vessel, is, however, similar to 
the moon boats in <em>Jerusalem</em> (see illus. 5).

<span class="notecall">This difference in style and medium suggests that the boat and watercolor wash are later additions to the sketch.</span><span class="sidenote">They
 seem to me to be visual annotations rather than part of a two-stage 
composition process in which the image is developed. They are roughly 
done, and in a medium that will not allow them to be overpainted.</span> Part <span class="notecall">of
 the singular character of the sketch is that Blake is relaxed enough to
 drop his principled opposition to copying from nature, which he 
elsewhere treats as “the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me,” claiming that
 “Natural Objects always did &amp; now do Weaken deaden &amp; obliterate
 Imagination.”</span><span class="sidenote"><em>A Vision of the Last Judgment</em> (E 565); annotations to Wordsworth’s <em>Poems</em> (E 665). See also the discussion in <em>Milton</em>
 of “the murderers / Of Jesus, who deny the Faith &amp; mock at Eternal 
Life: / Who pretend to Poetry that they may destroy Imagination; / By 
imitation of Natures Images drawn from Remembrance” (E 142).</span>
<p>In summary, <em>Landscape near Felpham</em> provides a number of 
distinct, though related, kinds of accuracy that can be cross-checked 
with nineteenth-century maps and photographs. It demonstrates (as 
perhaps no other work by Blake does) that he could and did sketch 
landscapes accurately from life, and that he could do so with an 
impressive precision in terms of spatial relationships, perspective, 
proportion, and visual detail. This mimetic accuracy offers, moreover, 
an unusual opportunity in Blake criticism to attempt to date the 
composition by careful consideration of the other details (tidal, 
meteorological, botanical) of the picture. Working with the hypothesis 
that this is a record of a real scene (i.e., as seen by Blake on a 
particular day at a particular time), we can relate the conditions that 
are evident in the sketch (i) to one another, (ii) to details in Blake’s
 correspondence, and (iii) to other sources, such as contemporary 
newspapers. The date that we derive from this specific combination of 
temporal details can then be related to the composition date of “To my 
Friend Butts.”</p>
<p>Let us begin with the year of composition. There are only four 
possibilities: 1800, 1801, 1802, 1803, as Blake was not in Felpham 
either before or after these dates. <span class="notecall">Unlike the letter, the sketch is undated, but has been designated as 1800,</span><span class="sidenote">Butlin dates the sketch c. 1800 (1: 312).</span>
 and the logic here seems just: the picture is full of optimism with its
 open skies and fields and the sunbeams falling on the cottage. The 
cheerful mood and the uncharacteristic interest in the subject matter 
are concomitant with the effusive delight over his cottage and setting 
that Blake expresses in his letters in the weeks before and after his 
arrival in Felpham. <span class="notecall">That delight is not present in later correspondence,</span><span class="sidenote">The
 one later exception is “Felpham Cottage / of Cottages the prettiest,” 
11 Sept. 1801 (E 717). Hayley says, “Our good Blake grows more &amp; 
more attach’d to this pleasant marine village” (to Flaxman, 18 Oct. 1801
 [<em>Letters</em> 37]), but this is part of a pair of open letters that includes content from Blake, who doesn’t pick up on the comment.</span>
 and this is not simply due to the shine wearing off his surroundings. 
Blake became unhappy quite quickly, and Catherine was ill for a long 
period, almost from arrival. Whereas the 1800 letters are full of 
optimism and delight, the letters of 1801 and 1802 are, as David Bindman
 puts it, <span class="notecall">“full of impassioned distress.”</span><span class="sidenote">Bindman 135.</span> <span class="notecall">By
 22 November 1802 Blake explains to Butts that he has “been very Unhappy
 &amp; could not think of troubling you about it or any of my real 
Friends (I have written many letters to you which I burnd &amp; did not 
send).”</span><span class="sidenote">E 719.</span> <span class="notecall">That
 dark mood carries from the letters into the poetry of the later period,
 and is manifest in another rare loco-descriptive poem of this time, 
which offers a fascinating point of comparison to “To my Friend Butts.”</span><span class="sidenote">In
 his second letter to Butts of 22 November 1802, Blake specifically 
states that he has written a poem while walking: “I will bore you more 
with some Verses which My Wife desires me to Copy out &amp; send you 
with her kind love &amp; Respect they were Composed &lt;above&gt; a 
twelvemonth ago [<em>in a</em>] &lt;while&gt; Walk&lt;ing&gt; from Felpham to Lavant to meet my Sister” (E 720).</span> It is a poem that starts in a mood similar to that of 2 October 1800:
</p><blockquote>With happiness stretchd across the hills<br>
In a cloud that dewy sweetness distills<br>
With a blue sky spread over with wings<br>
And a mild sun that mounts &amp; sings</blockquote>
But like a dark counterpart to Felpham’s “Heavenly Men,” it is the dead 
who show up, as the pleasant scene of nature rapidly degenerates into 
visionary horrors:
<blockquote>With my Father hovering upon the wind<br>
And my Brother Robert just behind<br>
And my Brother John the evil one<br>
In a black cloud making his mone<br>
Tho dead they appear upon my path<br>
Notwithstanding my terrible wrath<br>
They beg they intreat they drop their tears<br>
Filld full of hopes filld full of fears</blockquote>
<p>The visceral force of this later writing is unmistakable, and for 
these reasons the year of composition of the sketch seems certain to be 
1800. But what about the month? We are fortunate in this respect that 
the sketch shows both trees and crops, and this is consistent with the 
letters of this period, in which Blake is uncharacteristically detailed 
about his surroundings. He writes to Cumberland:
</p><blockquote><span class="notecall">I have taken a Cottage at Felpham on the Sea Shore of Sussex between Arundel &amp; Chichester. M<sup>r</sup>
 Hayley the Poet is soon to be my neighbour[;] he is now my friend; to 
him I owe the happy suggestion, for it was on a visit to him that I fell
 in love with my Cottage. … We lie on a Pleasant shore[;] it is within a
 mile of Bognor to which our Fashionables resort[.] My Cottage faces the
 South about a Quarter of a Mile from the Sea, only corn fields between.</span><span class="sidenote">Blake to Cumberland, 1 Sept. 1800 (Bentley, <em>Blake Records</em> 95-96).</span></blockquote>
<span class="notecall">These are the same fields portrayed in the sketch, but there they do not depict acres of waving corn;</span><span class="sidenote">Blake could draw corn; see, for example, <em>The Blighted Corn</em> in Lister pl. 63(i).</span>
 rather, they appear to be bare. A rider on a horse trots across the 
field, and there are no stalks, leaves, or ears of corn visible either 
generally or around, for example, the base of the fences. <span class="notecall">This indicates that the sketch was not made during Blake’s initial visit to Felpham in July 1800,</span><span class="sidenote">He
 was in Felpham for most of July 1800: “On 5 July 1800, Flaxman sent 
with Blake a letter and gifts to Hayley, and on 16 July Hayley wrote to 
Flaxman that ‘our good enthusiastic Friend Blake will … extend the time 
of his Residence in the south a little longer than we at first 
proposed’” (Bentley, <em>Stranger from Paradise</em> 208fn).</span> a time at which the corn would have been fully grown. <span class="notecall">The early harvest was brought in during August,</span><span class="sidenote">“Agriculture—Monthly
 report for August. From the uncommon fineness of the weather during the
 whole of the last month, and the greatest part of the present, the 
harvest in most places commenced a fortnight or three weeks sooner than 
usual, and in many of the southern and western districts, on this 
account, much of the crops have been already secured” (<em>Hampshire Chronicle</em> 8 Sept. 1800).</span>
 after Blake had gone back to London; therefore the sketch must have 
been made after he returned to Felpham in mid-September, by which time 
the fields were being prepared for the following year. Indeed, one of 
the first events recorded by Blake after his return is seeing the 
ploughman: <span class="notecall">“A roller &amp; two harrows lie before
 my window. I met a plow on my first going out at my gate the first 
morning after my arrival &amp; the Plowboy said to the Plowman. ‘Father 
The Gate is Open.’”</span><span class="sidenote">Blake to Butts, 23 Sept. 1800 (E 711).</span>
<p>This gives us 19 September 1800—the Blakes’ first full day in 
Felpham—as the earliest date for the sketch, but what is the latest 
possible date? Here the foliage provides an answer. The trees that are 
visible in the sketch (and which can be identified on the Ordnance 
Survey map) are a line of boundary trees. From the sketch, they appear 
to be deciduous hardwoods, quite possibly the same types of large 
spreading trees that still grow in the same location today: beech, oak, 
and horse chestnut. <span class="notecall">Although these trees would 
still have been in full leaf in September, the seasonal defoliation 
would have been quite advanced by the end of October, and given that 
there are no visible branches or other signs of defoliation in the 
sketch, it seems reasonable to take the end of October as the latest 
possible date for the picture’s composition.</span><span class="sidenote">As
 the weather had been unseasonably mild, the trees might have held their
 leaves a little longer. Even so, there are no branches visible on any 
of the trees in the picture. Certainly all leaves (and many branches) 
would have been gone by Sunday, 9 November, when a hurricane blew down 
houses, a mill, a barn, and uprooted 200 “stately oaks” at Glynde Bourne
 (<em>Hampshire Chronicle</em> 17 Nov. 1800).</span> This establishes a 
six-week window within which the sketch might have been made, between 
Friday, 19 September 1800 and Friday, 31 October 1800 (by which time 
arboreal defoliation would have been clearly visible). Narrowing the 
timeframe further requires working with a combination of tidal and solar
 information. <span class="notecall">The visibility of crepuscular rays 
in the sketch makes it possible to estimate the position of the sun, as 
the point of convergence of the rays can be located toward the top right
 of the picture.</span><span class="sidenote">“In real skies the 
crepuscular rays (the bright and dark beams apparently radiating from 
the sun when blocked by clouds) help one considerably to guess where the
 sun is, because they cross one another at the solar position. This 
phenomenon makes it very easy to locate the sun” (Barta et al. 1032).</span>
 The sketch is made facing north, and the sun is shown to be in the 
east/southeast in the image, so this is certainly morning, and the 
elevation of the sun would suggest mid-morning. For the purposes of this
 discussion I am therefore giving the broad parameters of a time of 
composition at least an hour after dawn and at least an hour before 
noon. This timeframe can then be related to the tidal conditions in 
order to narrow further the date. As I demonstrated earlier, for the 
sketch to have been made the tide must have been full, and indeed we see
 it lapping against the field’s edge. <span class="notecall">The dates 
on which high water occurred between one hour after dawn and eleven in 
the morning during the period from 19 September to 31 October are as 
follows: (i) Tuesday, 30 September to Thursday, 2 October inclusive; 
(ii) Wednesday, 15 October to Saturday, 18 October inclusive; and (iii) 
Wednesday, 29 October.</span><span class="sidenote">Tide timetables 
(which include times of sunrise and sunset) are available for Bognor for
 this period, along with tide heights. See &lt;﻿<a href="http://easytide.ukho.gov.uk/" target="_blank">http://​easytide.​ukho.​gov.​uk</a>﻿&gt;.</span>
 The last date is the least likely due to the probability of visible 
defoliation (of which the sketch shows no evidence). We are left with 
only two 3-4 day periods during Blake’s three-year stay in Felpham when 
the sketch could have been made. The first (30 September to 2 October) 
exactly coincides with the composition of the poem and letter to Butts. <span class="notecall">The
 probability of this particular timeframe (rather than the later date) 
corresponding to the composition of the sketch is further increased, as 
the details of weather (sunshine and clouds) described in both the 
letter and the poem it contains coincide with what we see in the 
picture.</span><span class="sidenote">Blake writes, “Our Cottage looks 
more &amp; more beautiful. And tho the weather is wet, the Air is very 
Mild. much Milder than it was in London when we came away” (to Butts, 2 
Oct. 1800 [E 713-14]).</span> On top of this, of course, we know that 
Blake had been at the location of the sketch at this time because his 
presence there is the subject of the poem.</p>
<p>What can we conclude from this? It is highly probable that the sketch
 of Felpham and the poem to Butts were composed within the same 
three-day period, and it is probable (given consistency of internal 
details regarding weather and time of day) that the scene they describe 
refers to the same day. Might they be the visual and literary 
manifestations of the same biographical experience? At first it seems 
not, as the sketch indicates that Blake was on a boat, whereas the poem 
has him on “the yellow sands sitting.” It is difficult to be certain how
 the shoreline looked in 1800, but today, at least, the “yellow sands” 
are not visible when the tide is full, as the upper shore is shale. <span class="notecall">It
 is possible, of course, that Blake was “on the yellow shale sitting” or
 “on the yellow shingle sitting” but that he preferred to use “sand,”</span><span class="sidenote">There
 is a poetic latitude in the description of the clouds as “Heavens 
Mountains,” for example. We have no record of Blake’s using the terms 
“shale” or “shingle” elsewhere.</span> which is such a <span class="notecall">significant term elsewhere in his work.</span><span class="sidenote">He
 uses the word in poems that bear a significant thematic relationship to
 the subject under discussion; see, for example, the “World in a Grain 
of Sand” of “Auguries of Innocence” (E 490), and the sands of the 
seashore (and particles of light) that reflect the “beams divine” and 
that blow into atheist eyes in “Mock on Mock on Voltaire Rousseau” (E 
477).</span> Such an argument need only be made, however, if it is 
assumed that the epiphany took place in a moment. Yet this is not what 
the poem narrates. Blake recounts an experience that takes place over 
time, and that starts out as a vision <em>by</em> the sea, but ends with a vision <em>on</em>
 it: “Such the Vision to me / Appeard on the Sea” concludes the poem. 
Perhaps, then, Blake’s vision began on the shore and ended on a boat. 
But wouldn’t he have mentioned putting out in a boat? Not necessarily, 
as he makes no explicit acknowledgment of his position in the sketch of 
the same scene. Perhaps so, but does “on the Sea” mean that Blake was on
 the sea, or just the vision? <span class="notecall">Granted, this is 
ambiguous, though the prepositional structure echoes the opening of the 
poem, which locates Blake and his “Vision of Light / On the yellow 
sands.”</span><span class="sidenote">The poem is more difficult to 
locate in space and time. The extempore character of the sketch and its 
visual accuracy indicate that there was no chronological space between 
the events depicted and the recording of those events, but this is not 
necessarily the case with the poem. Blake might have written the poem 
sitting on the beach or on the boat. But he might equally have composed 
it as part of his letter to Butts back at the cottage later the same 
day, or a day or two later, though the phrasing of the letter suggests 
that the poem was already written, as Blake “cannot resist the 
temptation” of sending it to Butts.</span> No firm conclusions can be 
drawn here; rather, the subject opens out the great difficulty of 
discussing recorded “religious” experience: such visions may be 
autobiographical, but they are also inextricably textual. It is these 
textual parameters and the continuity of metaphor and image with Blake’s
 correspondence in this period that I now wish to consider in more 
detail.
</p><p class="strong">III. Stairway to Heaven</p>
<p><span class="notecall">Essick and Viscomi write in their introduction to <em>Milton</em>
 that “Blake was so fully imbued with the language of the Bible that it 
is frequently difficult to separate purposeful allusion from the 
unselfconscious repetition of habitual patterns in many of Blake’s 
poems.”</span><span class="sidenote">Essick and Viscomi 13.</span> 
Indeed, throughout his art and correspondence, the Bible is not so much a
 subject of discussion as a means to understanding. It is not a static, 
self-interpreting monolith (the very thing his art contests), but a 
heuristic resource to understand his own life situation. This is 
especially evident in the correspondence surrounding the move to 
Felpham, which shows that the central tropes that Blake employs in “To 
my Friend Butts”—the ascent to heaven and return to earth, and the 
interaction of heavenly and earthly beings—neither begin nor end with 
the correspondence to his patron, but are a more widespread element of 
his thought at this time, and may be found in the letters that date back
 to his preliminary journey to Felpham in July.</p>
<p><span class="notecall">In July, Blake had written to Cumberland “I begin to Emerge from a Deep pit of Melancholy,”</span><span class="sidenote">Blake to Cumberland, 2 July 1800 (E 706).</span> and by the time he had reached Felpham in September, he could write <span class="notecall">“And Now Begins a New life. because another covering of Earth is shaken off.”</span><span class="sidenote">Blake to Flaxman, 21 Sept. 1800 (E 710).</span>
 In his letters of this period these images of ascent—of release from 
the pit, of resurrection, of shaking off the earth—eventually take the 
form of a specific and repeated biblical topos that derives from Genesis
 28:
</p><blockquote>And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward 
Haran. And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night,
 because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and 
put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. And he 
dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it 
reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending
 on it. And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD 
God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou 
liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as
 the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to
 the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy 
seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I am 
with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will
 bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I 
have done that which I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob awaked out of 
his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it 
not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is 
none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. 
(Genesis 28.10-17)</blockquote>
This passage shares with the visions discussed earlier (of Ezekiel, 
Paul, John, and of Blake himself) the possibility of ascent into heaven 
and of encounter with the divine. <span class="notecall">The passage 
also narrates Jacob’s exile and wandering, and the establishment of a 
new covenant between him and God, which Blake appropriates to 
conceptualize his own changed circumstances as he moves from the 
political and religious ferment of 1790s London to beginning a new 
century in this quiet, south-coast seaside village.</span><span class="sidenote">For Blake’s visceral response to contemporary London, see the letter to Cumberland, 1 Sept. 1800 (Bentley, <em>Blake Records</em> 95-97).</span>
 This new covenant characterizes Blake’s new life in his reestablished 
connections with God, with friendships, and with artistic inspiration.
<p>In the correspondence of this period Blake clearly envisages Jacob’s 
ladder as beginning in heaven and descending in a spiral over Felpham, 
winding around the Turret (his new place of work) to arrive at his own 
cottage door. In verses enclosed in a letter to Anna Flaxman, he writes:
</p><blockquote><span class="notecall">Away to Sweet Felpham for Heaven is there<br>
The Ladder of Angels descends thro the air<br>
On the Turret its spiral does softly descend<br>
Thro’ the village then winds at My Cot i[t] does end<br>
<br>
You stand in the village &amp; look up to heaven<br>
The precious stones glitter on flights seventy seven<br>
And My Brother is there &amp; My Friend &amp; Thine<br>
Descend &amp; Ascend with the Bread &amp; the Wine<br>
<br>
The Bread of sweet Thought &amp; the Wine of Delight<br>
Feeds the Village of Felpham by day &amp; by night<br>
And at his own door the blessd Hermit does stand<br>
Dispensing Unceasing to all the whole Land</span><span class="sidenote">Mrs. Blake to Mrs. Flaxman, 14 Sept. 1800 (E 709).</span></blockquote>
<a name="24" id="24"></a><span class="notecall">Blake’s mention of his “Brother” could refer to Hayley,</span><span class="sidenote">Hayley is, presumably, the “blessd Hermit” of the penultimate line.</span>
 but in this inspirational context, with angels ascending and descending
 from heaven, it seems more likely to refer to his dead brother Robert, 
with whom Blake continues to <span class="notecall">“converse daily &amp; hourly in the Spirit.”</span><span class="sidenote">Blake to Hayley, 6 May 1800 (E 705).</span> The <span class="notecall">imagery of the new covenant is emphasized through the bread and wine elements of the Last Supper,</span><span class="sidenote">Matthew 26.26-29; Mark 14.22-25; Luke 22.13-20.</span> and the <span class="notecall">“seventy seven” flights of steps perhaps correspond to the forgiveness of sins that Blake considers central to Christianity.</span><span class="sidenote">“Then
 came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against
 me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say 
not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven” 
(Matthew 18.21-22); Blake: “Forgiveness of Sins This alone is the Gospel
 &amp; this is the Life &amp; Immortality brought to light by Jesus” (E 
875).</span> The “precious stones” may relate to the stones of Genesis 
28.11, while the “house of God” and the “gate of heaven” of Genesis 
28.17 are likewise, Blake suggests, to be found in Felpham itself:
<blockquote><span class="notecall">Felpham is a sweet place for Study. 
because it is more Spiritual than London&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven opens here on
 all sides her golden Gates&nbsp;&nbsp;her windows are not obstructed by
 vapours.&nbsp;&nbsp;voices of Celestial inhabitants are more distinctly

 Shadow of their houses.</span><span class="sidenote">Blake to Flaxman, 21 Sept. 1800 (E 710).</span></blockquote>
<p><span class="notecall">Blake’s particular uses of Jacob’s ladder in

The subject is not new, as there is a long-standing iconographical 
tradition depicting this famous biblical scene, in which Jacob is 
typically presented as lying asleep, with the ladder taking the form of a
 beam of light leading up into the sun. <span class="notecall">Blake is certainly conscious of such works,</span><span class="sidenote">See, for example, Ludovico Cardi da Cigoli’s <em>Jacob’s Dream</em> (1593); Johann Wilhelm Baur’s <em>Jacob’s Dream</em> (c. 1600-40); Michael Willmann’s <em>Landscape with the Dream of Jacob </em>(1691); Aert de Gelder’s <em>Jacob’s Dream</em> (c. 1710-15). Blake certainly knew Raphael’s painting of this subject (see Beer 31-32).</span>
 and in characteristic fashion he follows the tradition, but also 
recasts it: his use of a spiral staircase in this context is, as Anthony
 Blunt puts it, <span class="notecall">“a complete novelty in the iconography of this subject.”</span><span class="sidenote">Quoted in Paley 200.</span>
 Yet it is not a complete novelty in Blake’s work because it is the very
 image used in the poem to Anna Flaxman. Like the painting, his poem 
describes not a “Ladder” with rungs, but one with seventy-seven 
“flights” of stairs glittering with precious stones and—as in his 
painting—that staircase is specifically “spiral.” Moreover, at the 
bottom of the staircase in the painting are two angels carrying a basket
 of bread (with some grapes and vine leaves) and a pitcher of what is 
presumably wine; again these are not part of the iconographical 
tradition of the subject (nor of the Genesis narrative), yet they 
correlate to the poem, in which <span class="notecall">“My Friend &amp; Thine / Descend &amp; Ascend with the Bread &amp; the Wine.”</span><span class="sidenote">This
 Eucharistic inflection may derive from Jesus’s apparent reference to 
the Genesis passage when he proclaims “Hereafter ye shall see heaven 
open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of 
man” (John 1.51). Blake also includes not just angels but humans 
(including friends, lovers, infants, and children) on his ladder, a 
populous world which, like the letters of this period, is full of 
angels. Blake calls Hayley “Leader of My Angels” (16 Sept. 1800 [E 
709]); his “Dear Flaxman” is “a Sublime Archangel” (21 Sept. 1800 [E 
710]); Butts is the “Dear Friend of My Angels” (23 Sept. 1800 [E 711]); 
“the time is now arrivd when Men shall again converse in Heaven &amp; 
walk with Angels” (to Flaxman, 12 Sept. 1800 [E 707]); and, in one of 
the more flighty passages, Blake is “more famed in Heaven” for his works
 than he “could well concieve” because in his brain “are studies &amp; 
Chambers filld with books &amp; pictures of old,” which he “wrote &amp; 
painted in ages of Eternity” before his mortal life, and those “works 
are the delight &amp; Study of Archangels” (to Flaxman, 21 Sept. 1800 [E
 710]).</span>
<p>This continuity between Blake’s painting and his poem to Mrs. Flaxman
 is striking. It is more than just his painting a subject that is a 
presiding metaphor in his correspondence at this time: his images and 
letters share certain specifics that are part of neither the original 
Genesis narrative nor the iconographical tradition of the subject, and 
that do not occur together elsewhere in his corpus. <span class="notecall">Their
 conjugation suggests, although does not prove, that the painting may 
have been composed around the time of Blake’s move to Felpham.</span><span class="sidenote">It
 is currently dated c. 1799-1806 by the British Museum and c. 1805 by 
Butlin. The continuity has been noted by Keynes, among others (<em>Letters</em> 21n3).</span> <span class="notecall">What
 is certain is that Blake had the same imagery in his mind at the time 
of his relocation and at the time of the composition of the painting.</span><span class="sidenote">In
 the painting, Jacob is lying on the shore of the ocean, a detail that 
again is not part of the biblical text or the iconographical tradition, 
but is relevant to Blake’s Felpham setting. The painting suggests a 
universality through its visual gestures to space, sky, earth, shore, 
and sea, indicated respectively by the stars, the clouds immediately 
above Jacob’s left arm and staff, the curve of the globe to the right of
 his foot, the rocks immediately under his right arm and side, and the 
waves lapping against those rocks to the bottom left of the picture (the
 waves resemble, for example, those in <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=vda.o.illbk.01&amp;java=no" target="_blank">pl. 1</a> of <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> [copy O] and <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=mhh.h.illbk.10&amp;java=no" target="_blank">pl. 10</a> of <em>The Marriage</em> [copy H]).</span>
 This contiguity of imagery allows us to ask what light the shared 
elements of Blake’s painting and the poem to Mrs. Flaxman might shed on <em>Landscape near Felpham</em> and “To my Friend Butts,” for the image of Jacob’s ladder has strong resonances in those works.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the iconographical tradition of the Jacob 
story typically presents the ladder as a crepuscular ray, and this is 
echoed in the naturalistic <em>Landscape near Felpham</em>, in which the rays descend from the sun to the cottage, just as the ladder “at My Cot” “does end” in the poem to Anna Flaxman. <span class="notecall">In
 “To my Friend Butts” there is, likewise, a great emphasis on the rays 
of the sun: not only the “Glorious beams” pouring from “Heavens high 
Streams”</span><span class="sidenote">These “streams” in heaven may also echo the fountains and river of Revelation and Butts’s poem discussed earlier.</span>
 and “the Streams / Of Heavens bright beams” that Blake stands in 
immediately prior to finding himself above Felpham, but also the “beams 
of bright gold” that enfold his limbs. <span class="notecall">The 
correlation to the iconographical tradition discussed above is clear: 
Blake’s journey with the particles of light into the sky above Felpham 
and into the bosom of God/Jesus is a figuration of the ascent of Jacob’s
 ladder among angels, who for Blake—as many of his paintings show—were 
beings of light.</span><span class="sidenote">See, for example, his c. 1803-05 watercolor <em><a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=but518.wc.01&amp;vg=biblicalwc&amp;vcontext=biblicalwc&amp;landing=object&amp;titles=&amp;java=no&amp;mode=vcopy" target="_blank">Angel of the Revelation</a></em>.
 “To my Friend Butts” reconfirms numerous other elements anticipated in 
the letters: the transformation of Felpham into a gateway to heaven; the
 focus on the immediacy of firsthand experience; the glittering stones 
(anticipating the “particles bright”); and the vision of Blake’s 
“Brother” and “Friend” (in “To my Friend Butts” Blake sees his “Sister 
&amp; Friend”).</span></p>
<p>This material is characterized by the coexistence and interplay of naturalistic and symbolic elements. In Blake’s <em>Jacob’s Ladder</em>,
 a painting rich in symbolism, we might expect to find “the Lord” 
standing above the top of the ladder as the text states (Genesis 28.13),
 but instead we find a comparatively naturalistic sun (from which rays 
emanate, but they do not form the staircase); <span class="notecall">in <em>Landscape near Felpham</em>,
 the rays of sunshine that fall on Blake’s cottage may be naturalistic, 
but, as Lister notes, they also seem to serve a symbolic function.</span><span class="sidenote">Lister (pl. 25) suggests that the “sunbeam” is “perhaps meant to denote the light of inspiration shining on his home.”</span>
 Again, in “To my Friend Butts” the richly symbolic narrative of Blake’s
 ascent into the bosom of God/Jesus to be purged of the “mire” and the 
“clay” resonates with the language of baptism, resurrection, and 
transfiguration. Yet it can also be read as a naturalistic account of a 
man sitting on the beach enjoying the wonderful sensation of basking in 
sunshine. Neither reading negates the other, as this body of work is 
monistic: it is simultaneously earthly and heavenly, and there is no 
dividing line between naturalistic and symbolic content, or between 
material and spiritual elements.</p>
<p>This continuity is still more fully realized in <em>Milton</em>, the 
prophetic poem that reaches its climax with Blake’s vision of Milton in 
his cottage garden at Felpham. The vision is complicated, so I will 
first recap some of its key (bewildering) events. Blake is in his garden
 when Ololon (approximately Milton’s emanation) descends in the form of 
“a Virgin of twelve years” and speaks to him (36.17, E 137). Milton’s 
Shadow also descends, though his form is rather more complex, as he is 
the Covering Cherub, appearing as “the Wicker Man of Scandinavia” 
(37.11, E 137). He is large and contains multitudes: inside him is 
Satan, and inside Satan is Rahab. Also inside him are the “Monstrous 
Churches of Beulah” and “the Gods of Ulro dark” (37.16, E 137), yet he 
nonetheless appears as the Puritan of tradition, dressed in black (38.8,
 E 138). While this is happening, the Spectre of Satan is roaring on the
 sea “upon mild Felpham shore” (38.13, E 139) and rolling his thunders 
against Milton. Rather than describing Satan from the vantage point of 
his cottage garden, Blake enters into Satan’s bosom (38.15, E 139), and 
from there shows Satan as a “ruind building of God not made with hands” 
(38.16, E 139) where Mystery Babylon dwells and where Jerusalem is bound
 in chains. Milton now addresses Satan, announcing that he (Milton) is 
come in self-annihilation, an act that will simultaneously annihilate 
Satan. Satan counters aggressively with the claim that he himself is 
“God the judge of all,” and that Milton must fall down and worship him 
(39.51-53, E 139).</p>
<p>Events now intensify. The “Starry Seven” are burning on Blake’s path,
 making it “a solid fire, as bright / As the clear Sun” as “Milton 
silent” comes down upon it (39.3-5, E 140). Calling on Albion to awake, 
“Forms / Human” go forth from the limbs of the Starry Seven, forming a 
“mighty Column of Fire / Surrounding Felphams Vale, reaching to the 
Mundane Shell” (39.8-10, E 140). Meanwhile, Satan is “Howling in his 
Spectre” (39.18, E 140), and in this final stage of the confrontation 
with Milton extends his claim to divinity by appearing in the likeness 
of God, <span class="notecall">surrounded by inversions of the four beasts or Zoas</span><span class="sidenote">See, for example, Ezekiel chapter 1 and Revelation chapter 4.</span>
 (Satan’s are Chaos, Sin, Death, and Ancient Night [39.22-30, E 140]). 
Albion hears the call of the Starry Seven, but has not the strength to 
respond. Seeing in Satan his own “embodied Spectre” he tries to “walk 
into the Deep” at Felpham (his left foot is on the nearby “Rocks of 
Bognor”), but his strength fails and “with dreadful groans” he sinks 
back onto his couch (39.46-51, E 141).</p>
<p>Ololon speaks conciliatory words to Milton, confessing her own part 
in creating a destructive natural religion (Rahab), and immediately 
Rahab Babylon herself appears in Satan’s bosom (40.17-20, E 141). Milton
 replies to Ololon that he has come in self-annihilation and to renounce
 the “Selfhood, which must be put off &amp; annihilated alway / To 
cleanse the Face of my Spirit by Self-examination” (40.36-37, E 142). 
His sixfold emanations <span class="notecall">(in one sense the wives and daughters he was alienated from during his earthly life)</span><span class="sidenote">“Those three females whom his Wives, &amp; those three whom his Daughters / Had represented and containd” (17.1-2, E 110).</span>
 now separate from Ololon and reenter Milton’s Shadow, thereby 
rehumanizing him (42.3-6, E 143). The Starry Seven of earlier in the 
scene have now become a “Starry Eight” through the reintegration of 
Milton. Ololon as “a Moony Ark” descends “to Felphams Vale,” while the 
Starry Eight are transfigured into “One Man Jesus the Saviour” and the 
“Clouds of Ololon” fold round his limbs “as a Garment dipped in blood” 
(42.10-12, E 143). Jesus walks forth from Felpham’s vale to enter 
Albion’s bosom, while Blake falls outstretched on his path (much as John
 of Patmos falls at Jesus’s feet in Revelation 1.17); the lark mounts 
with a loud trill (the moment of dawn), and among final apocalyptic 
images, the poem ends (42.19-20, 25, 29, E 143).</p>
<p>Like the works discussed earlier, <em>Milton</em> consistently 
expresses continuities between the naturalistic and symbolic and the 
material and spiritual, not least through its characters, who are (among
 other things) both psychic forces and natural phenomena: <span class="notecall">Los appears as the sun,</span><span class="sidenote">In
 Blake’s second letter to Butts of 22 November 1802, mentioned above, 
the verses include a description of Los as the sun: “Then Los appeard in
 all his power / In the Sun he appeard descending before / My face in 
fierce flames in my double sight / Twas outward a Sun: inward Los in his
 might” (E 722). In <em>Milton</em> there is a corresponding passage: 
“Los descended to me: / And Los behind me stood; a terrible flaming Sun:
 just close / Behind my back; I turned round in terror, and behold. / 
Los stood in that fierce glowing fire” (22 [24].5-8, E 116-17). This 
bears a resemblance to the union with the “One Man” of “To my Friend 
Butts,” and perhaps explains why Sloss and Wallis identify this figure 
as Los (see <a href="#31">note 31</a>, above).</span> Ololon as the moon
 (42.7, E 143), Milton as lightning (20.26, E 114), as a cloud (21.36, E
 116), and so on. Yet there is a still closer association to the earlier
 Felpham material, again centered on the topos of Jacob’s ladder. The 
connection is brought to light by the phrase “paved work,” which occurs 
three times in <em>Milton</em>’s climactic scene (38.6, E 138; 39.24, E 
140; 40.18, E 141). What is this “paved work”? Behind the vision of 
Satan stands a biblical vision of the lawgiver God of Exodus. <span class="notecall">Exodus
 24.10 states that the Israelites “saw the God of Israel: and there was 
under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it 
were the body of heaven in his clearness.”</span><span class="sidenote">God
 promises the “tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have
 written” to Moses just two verses later (Exodus 24.12). The image of 
Satan “Coming in a Cloud with Trumpets &amp; with Fiery Flame” (39.23, E
 140) points us to neighboring passages such as Exodus 19.16-20.</span> 
Blake (like many interpreters) takes the clear blue “paved work” as the 
sky itself. Milton “descend[s]” on this paved work, and it offers a 
passage between heaven and earth in the same manner as Jacob’s ladder:
</p><blockquote><span style="padding-left: 25px">Milton collecting all his fibres into impregnable strength</span><br>
Descended down a Paved work of all kinds of precious stones<br>
Out from the eastern sky; descending down into my Cottage<br>
Garden: clothed in black, severe &amp; silent he descended. (38.5-8, E 138)</blockquote>
<span class="notecall">Here the “Paved work” corresponds to the night 
sky, and the “precious stones” are the stars, something we have seen 
before in the letter to Mrs. Flaxman, where the “precious stones” 
glitter on the “flights” of steps.</span><span class="sidenote">In book 1 of <em>Milton</em>, Satan turns the translucent “paved terraces” of his interior into the blackness of space as he shuts out the divine vision:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 5px; text-indent: -15px">Thus Satan rag’d amidst the Assembly! and his bosom grew</span><br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 5px; text-indent: -15px">Opake against the Divine Vision: the paved terraces of</span><br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 5px; text-indent: -15px">His bosom inwards shone with fires, but the stones becoming opake!</span><br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 5px; text-indent: -15px">Hid him from sight, in an extreme blackness and darkness,</span><br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 5px; text-indent: -15px">And there a World of deeper Ulro was open’d, in the midst</span><br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 5px; text-indent: -15px">Of the Assembly. In Satans bosom a vast unfathomable Abyss. (9.30-35, E 103)</span></span> The stars are also depicted in Blake’s painting of Jacob’s ladder surrounding the lower flights of the stairs, <span class="notecall">and in two of the major <em>Milton</em>
 images (pls. 29 and 33) we see stars about to enter the feet of Blake 
and his brother Robert, who stand next to what looks like—as Erdman 
points out—“the lower steps of Jacob’s ladder in Blake’s watercolor.”</span><span class="sidenote">“We
 see that the stones of Satan’s paved terraces that had grown opaque 
have in an instant recovered their original glory as a luminous 
hewn-stone ladder of returning and going forth. They may properly remind
 us of the lower steps of Jacob’s ladder in Blake’s watercolor” (Erdman,
 “The Steps” 82).</span>
<p>Satan too stands on this “bright Paved-work / Of precious stones,” again in darkness:
</p><blockquote>Loud Satan thunderd, loud &amp; dark upon mild Felphams Shore<br>
Coming in a Cloud with Trumpets &amp; with Fiery Flame<br>
An awful Form eastward from midst of a bright Paved-work<br>
Of precious stones by Cherubim surrounded: so permitted<br>
(Lest he should fall apart in his Eternal Death) to imitate <br>
The Eternal Great Humanity Divine surrounded by<br>
His Cherubim &amp; Seraphim in ever happy Eternity<br>
Beneath sat Chaos: Sin on his right hand Death on his left<br>
And Ancient Night spread over all the heavn his Mantle of Laws. (39.22-30, E 140)</blockquote>
The paved work of Exodus also appears as the sky of day, as we see in 
its final iteration when Rahab-Babylon appears as the sun in the east:
<blockquote><span style="padding-left: 175px">Rahab Babylon appeard</span><br>
Eastward upon the Paved work across Europe &amp; Asia <br>
Glorious as the midday Sun in Satans bosom glowing. (40.17-19, E 141)</blockquote>
<span class="notecall">In <em>Milton </em>then, the “paved work” 
corresponds to the skies of both day and night, and this too is 
consistent with Blake’s watercolor of Jacob’s ladder, in the lower half 
of which it is night and stars shine, while in the upper half the sun 
blazes its glorious rays.</span><span class="sidenote">The similarity of the “paved work” to the ladder of Blake’s picture does not extend to its taking a spiral form, yet <em>Milton</em>
 is nonetheless full of spiral images. Los (himself the sun) has taken 
Blake from Lambeth to Felpham in a “whirlwind” (36.21, E 137); the 
flight of the lark is a spiral ascent; the “Ears in close volutions / 
Shot spiring out in the deep darkness” (3.17-18, E 97); and infinity is 
described as a “vortex” that is expressly linked to the sun, moon, and 
stars:<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 5px; text-indent: -15px">The nature of infinity is this: That every thing has its</span><br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 5px; text-indent: -15px">Own Vortex; and when once a traveller thro Eternity.</span><br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 5px; text-indent: -15px">Has passd that Vortex, he percieves it roll backward behind</span><br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 5px; text-indent: -15px">His path, into a globe itself infolding; like a sun:</span><br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 5px; text-indent: -15px">Or like a moon, or like a universe of starry majesty. (15.21-25, E 109)</span></span>
<p><span class="notecall">The same luminescent passage to the heavens springs up from Blake’s garden in the climax to <em>Milton</em>,
 as the Starry Seven take on “Forms / Human” and stand “in a mighty 
Column of Fire” reaching from Felpham to the sky (39.8-9, E 140).</span><span class="sidenote">The
 “Column of Fire” is yet another human-formed connection between heaven 
and earth, and also evokes the “pillar of fire” found in Exodus 13.21-22
 and elsewhere.</span> As they do so, they integrate with Milton, and 
thereby become “One Man Jesus the Saviour” (42.11, E 143). This column 
of shining human forms is strongly reminiscent of the “Heavenly Men 
beaming bright” who likewise appear as “One Man” who enfolds Blake in 
his “bosom sun bright” and makes himself known to Blake, as I suggested 
earlier, as Jesus. Yet what is so extraordinary about Blake’s 
redeployment of the Felpham vision in <em>Milton</em> is that he not only uses it in his vision of Jesus, but also in his vision of Satan:
</p><blockquote>The Spectre of Satan stood upon the roaring sea &amp; beheld<br>
Milton within his sleeping Humanity! trembling &amp; shuddring<br>
He stood upon the waves a Twenty-seven-fold mighty Demon<br>
Gorgeous &amp; beautiful: loud roll his thunders against Milton<br>
Loud Satan thunderd, loud &amp; dark upon mild Felpham shore<br>
Not daring to touch one fibre he howld round upon the Sea.<br>
<br>
I also stood in Satans bosom &amp; beheld its desolations!<br>
A ruind Man: a ruind building of God not made with hands;<br>
Its plains of burning sand, its mountains of marble terrible:<br>
Its pits &amp; declivities flowing with molten ore &amp; fountains<br>
Of pitch &amp; nitre: its ruind palaces &amp; cities &amp; mighty works;<br>
Its furnaces of affliction in which his Angels &amp; Emanations<br>
Labour with blackend visages among its stupendous ruins<br>
Arches &amp; pyramids &amp; porches colonades &amp; domes:<br>
In which dwells Mystery Babylon, here is her secret place<br>
From hence she comes forth on the Churches in delight<br>
Here is her Cup filld with its poisons, in these horrid vales<br>
And here her scarlet Veil woven in pestilence &amp; war:<br>
Here is Jerusalem bound in chains, in the Dens of Babylon. (38.9-27, E 139)</blockquote>
As in “To my Friend Butts,” Blake sees an anthropomorphic vision over 
the sea at Felpham and enters into its bosom. The view from that bosom 
likewise opens onto sands and mountains, but they are “burning” and 
“terrible,” and rather than “Felpham sweet,” Blake sees “ruind palaces 
&amp; cities.” <span class="notecall">This is no longer the mountain of the Lord as imagined by Isaiah</span><span class="sidenote">See <a href="#33">note 33</a>, above.</span> and “To my Friend Butts,” but the mountain of the God of Exodus, the Hell of <em>Paradise Lost</em>,
 and the dwelling place of Babylon where Jerusalem is bound in chains. 
The beings of light are now “Angels &amp; Emanations” with “blackend 
visages,” and the journey into the sun is not a journey into God, but 
into Rahab Babylon, who appears “Glorious as the midday Sun in Satans 
bosom glowing.”
<p>Why do this? It seems extraordinary that rather than keeping the 
divine vision of “To my Friend Butts” in his heart, safe from 
contamination, Blake redeploys it as a vision of Satan that is so 
appalling, so sublime, that the reiteration is not even immediately 
obvious. <span class="notecall">One possibility is that he felt he had been deluded by Felpham and wished to revoke his vision,</span><span class="sidenote">There are lines in <em>Milton</em>
 that would support this idea. The poem provides a sustained critique of
 “Natural Religion,” and it may be that Blake felt that he had been 
deceived by nature at Felpham, committing to its delights in a way that 
subsequently betrayed him (he was initially delighted by it, but 
Catherine became ill and things fell apart):<br>

 but the redeployment seems to me entirely consistent with Blake’s wider
 work. As he never tires of showing, meaning cannot be legislated or 
restricted by narratives. Blake’s “infernal” readings of <em>Paradise Lost</em> and the book of Job in <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> and of the early chapters of Genesis in <em>The Book of Urizen</em>
 offer striking examples of this. Throughout his work, he draws our 
attention to the fact that art provides us not with meanings, but with 
narrative—or imaginative—structures (such as those of <em>Paradise Lost</em>
 and the Bible) wherein meaning may be sought, contested, found, or 
relinquished. This applies even to his own work, such that the Felpham 
“Vision of Light” can be renarrated as an instance of “Single vision 
&amp; Newtons sleep,” disclosing, among other things, the apocalyptic 
horror of an England that has come to regard reason as the only true 
understanding, and materialism as its core (and only) reality.</p>
<p><span class="notecall">Blake develops this hermeneutic through his 
concept of fourfold vision, whereby the difference between being a 
haunted failure living in a dead universe and becoming an individual who
 has “traveld thro Perils &amp; Darkness not unlike a Champion” to 
conquer and to “Go on Conquering … among the Stars of God &amp; in the 
Abysses of the Accuser” is not about living in different worlds, but 
about seeing the same world at a more fully human level.</span><span class="sidenote">The
 move from the former to the latter is enacted autobiographically in 
“With happiness stretchd across the hills,” the poem from the second 
letter to Butts of 22 November 1802, which narrates Blake’s recovery 
from depression to fourfold vision (E 720-22). The quotations in the 
text are from another letter to Butts of the same day (E 720).</span> He
 suggests that our lives, our experiences, just as much as our art, are 
narrative structures, and that the content of those structures is not 
fixed. Salvation from the satanic nightmare, Blake suggests, involves 
ascending Jacob’s ladder, being raised to the divine-human level of 
vision through the incorporation and integration of the different 
aspects of our humanity, both individual and corporate. Hence the 
redemption of Milton—who has become dehumanized through his estrangement
 from his emanation—depends on his being restored to the fullness of his
 personhood. This is a familiar theme in Blake’s works, in which 
Albion’s redemption depends on the reintegration of his four Zoas and 
their emanations.</p>
<p>This process of redemption is not incidental to Blake’s work; it is 
its central theme and its method, as his art enacts the ongoing labor of
 reopening and reconnecting closed-off aspects of our humanity (both as 
individuals and as societies). Yet it is a difficult topic to discuss, 
and the satanic (fallen) and divine (redeemed) versions of the Felpham 
vision bring into clear focus the challenge raised in any account of 
Blake’s “religion”: <span class="notecall">however preferable the latter
 is to the former, the two cannot be permanently split apart, as they 
constitute different aspects of what we are.</span><span class="sidenote">Even
 at a formal level their continuity is evident. They cannot be divided 
along an earthly-heavenly axis, as they are equally biblical, epiphanic,
 and “religious.” Like “To my Friend Butts,” the <em>Milton</em> passage
 is couched in the language and imagery of Revelation, which is drawn on
 to depict Babylon’s dominion over the churches. In Revelation 13.1 
John, like Blake, “stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise 
up out of the sea.”</span> The complexity of Blake’s prophetic books 
suggests how difficult it is to hold on to this central truth, and it 
has proved evasive in the reception history of his work. That reception 
is characterized by an antagonistic division of “religious” and 
“secular” outlooks, and a bifurcation of “transcendent” and 
“materialist” interpretations into two worldviews that have little 
interest in one another. Hence, in the case of “To my Friend Butts,” I 
suggested earlier that the transcendent character of the poem has 
assured its sustained presence in non-academic appropriations of Blake 
(particularly in anthologies of mystical writing), and that this has 
evolved with a concomitant disregard for the material context of the 
vision (the abridged poem is invariably presented as a self-sufficient 
and self-explanatory entity). <span class="notecall">In academic 
studies, the reverse has been true: the scholarly discussion of Blake 
and religion continues to flourish, and since the early 1990s in 
particular has sought a more detailed understanding of the material and 
cultural contexts of Blake’s religion,</span><span class="sidenote">Blake is at the heart of the ferment of interest in London’s dissenting subcultures catalyzed by Jon Mee’s <em>Dangerous Enthusiasm</em> (1992) and discussed in a range of subsequent works, including E. P. Thompson’s <em>Witness against the Beast</em> (1993), Robert Rix’s <em>William Blake and the Cultures of Radical Christianity</em> (2007), Magnus Ankarsjö’s <em>William Blake and Religion</em> (2009), and a host of essay collections and journal articles.</span>
 which has often been cast as a historical concern with his 
denominational affiliations (Anglican, Moravian, Muggletonian, 
Swedenborgian). This conversation has been correspondingly less engaged 
with the transcendent aspects of Blake’s work, and “To my Friend Butts” 
has not featured in it. The depth and pervasiveness of this 
religious/secular binary can be seen in the astonishing claim <span class="notecall">made
 in one recent critical work that Blake “flaunted his secular 
religiousness deliberately by constantly writing of God and Christ even 
though he was an atheist and an unbeliever.”</span><span class="sidenote">See Quinney 25-26.</span> <span class="notecall">This
 is the same Blake who wrote in one of the letters to Butts discussed 
earlier, “I still &amp; shall to Eternity Embrace Christianity and Adore
 him who is the Express image of God,” and for whom <em>Milton</em> is 
the means to “cast off” “the destroyers of Jerusalem … the murderers / 
Of Jesus, who deny the Faith &amp; mock at Eternal Life.”</span><span class="sidenote">22 Nov. 1802 (E 720); <em>Milton</em> 41.12, 21-22 (E 142).</span></p>
<p>My aim in showing the range of literary and biographical contexts 
within which “To my Friend Butts” occurs has been to reconnect its 
material and transcendent aspects. By giving a different perspective on 
this material, I have tried to show that the sketch and poem (and the 
later reworking in <em>Milton</em>) offer an account of the undoing, or 
integration, of the material/transcendent dyad, as Blake’s religious 
experience turns out to be neither material nor transcendent but both, 
because the two entities are ultimately revealed to be different aspects
 of the same human-divine reality. How so? Let me recap. Blake begins a 
new life in Felpham in 1800. He conceptualizes that change through a 
small group of biblical topoi that center on new life through a divine 
covenant. He is so deeply grounded in the Bible that the 
conceptualization is, as it were, natural to his self-understanding, and
 fills his correspondence to friends at the time. Shortly after 
beginning this life he experiences a vision that constitutes a 
fulfillment of the anticipated covenant. He reports this epiphany among 
the domestic details of an affectionate letter to a friend. The vision 
is expressed in the same relaxed, amicable, first-person voice as the 
correspondence in which it appears. In comparison with the author’s 
other work, it betrays few signs of intellectual struggle or rhetorical 
forcefulness. Nonetheless, it gently engages the local landscape, the 
visions and poetry of his correspondent, his own readings from 
Swedenborg and Newton, and a wide range of biblical texts, while 
bringing together the living, the dead, the past, and the future. It 
provides an integration of past time into the present (“All I ever had 
known / Before me bright Shone”); an integration of God and the 
individual as the narrator is incorporated into the divine humanity (“In
 his bosom sun bright / I remaind”); an integration of humanity and 
natural phenomena (stones, rocks, hills, herbs, trees become men, “Human
 formd”); an integration of epistemology (Newtonian physics, 
Swedenborgian theology, and biblical narrative are harmonized); and an 
experiential integration in the narrator (the transcendent elements are 
inseparable from the domestic context and affections). In addition to 
all this, the vision has a visual counterpart, a sketch that is realist 
in execution, yet which shares the same quiet joy. The continuity of 
material and transcendent elements across the two works testifies that 
earth and heaven, humanity and God constitute a single reality for Blake
 at this time. In sum, the trauma of a divided universe—elsewhere the 
great drama of Blake’s work—is healed for a moment with a wonderful 
lightness of touch as the poem performs the work of integration. That 
lightness may come from all the things that the poem and sketch are 
willing to relinquish: in their mildness they let go of the vatic 
authorial persona of <em>Milton</em> and <em>Jerusalem</em>; of the dramatis personae of the prophecies; of the political, social, and psychological critique of the <em>Songs</em>; of the theological polemic of <em>The Marriage</em>;
 and of the righteous indignation of the letter to Dr. Trusler. 
Paradoxically, Blake’s most intimate, autobiographical lyric and its 
visual counterpart are the least “Blakean” instances of his art that we 
possess.</p>
<p>Yet Blake does not enshrine this quiet vision, but instead gives its 
life to a prophetic poem in which it can also stand as a structure of 
ruination. By doing so, he reminds us that the sacred and the secular 
must not be used as categories to split the universe in two, for if we 
encounter them in the fullness of our humanity, they are not divisible 
phenomena outside us, but living continuities within. Similarly, the act
 of separating and reifying single aspects of life—whether biographical,
 natural, rational, sexual, political, religious, material, historical, 
or whatever—constitutes, in Blake’s terms, the error of the unredeemed 
Milton, of Urizen, of the twenty-seven churches, and, as the preface to <em>Milton</em> puts it, of the hirelings in the camp, the court, and (more than ever) the university. It is, to borrow from <em>The Marriage</em>,
 to take portions of existence and fancy that the whole. What then is 
Blake’s alternative? He is an unrelenting critic of the Bible, of 
religion, and of the churches, <span class="notecall">but he is also a Christological</span><span class="sidenote">“Christological” is not really the right word, as his concern is principally with Jesus, but “Jesusological” seems awkward.</span>
 artist, for whom Christianity meant the integration of what we have 
culturally divided into the human and the divine, the material and the 
transcendent. His work is everywhere concerned with human integration 
(both within individuals and between people), which is to say building 
Jerusalem and restoring Albion. However, as for Wordsworth, developing a
 unified vision of the world requires labor, and Blake’s Christianity is
 emphatically not constituted by passive intellectual assent to a static
 corpus of propositions. Rather, it is concerned with striving to 
participate in a living body of humanity that Blake calls “the Divine 
Body of the Lord Jesus” (<em>Milton</em> 3.4, E 96). The work of that 
process of integration is—in Blake’s terms—the work of art: “Prayer is 
the Study of Art / Praise is the Practise of Art,” as he would later 
write in <em>Laocoön</em> (E 274), and this process of building Jerusalem also means—as <em>Milton</em>
 shows—rehumanizing the material universe so that it is no longer the 
alienated “Newtonian Voids between the Substances of Creation” (37.46, E
 138). Blake’s work calls for, and exemplifies, a life that is not 
reduced either to separate categories of the material and the 
transcendent, or to the disciplinary divisions of academia. So, where 
then do “visions and revelations” such as that of “To my Friend Butts” 
take place? They occur where the separation of human and divine, spirit 
and body is relinquished; to borrow from Paul the Apostle’s own account,
 “whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I 
cannot tell: God knoweth” (2 Corinthians 12.1-2).</p>
