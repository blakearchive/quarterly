            <title>Introduction</title>
          </head>
          <p>The past two and a half years have seen the publication of a study in moral
                        and political theory by Stuart Hampshire under the title <hi rend="i">Innocence and
Experience</hi>, an account of the police investigation
                        in the business of a property developer, Kevin Taylor’s <hi rend="i">The Poisoned
Tree</hi> (with Keith Mumby), and a new novel by A. N.
                        Wilson, treating of the <hi rend="i">Daughters of Albion</hi>, with
                        “Jerusalem” for its theme song. Some 10 years ago, Drew
                        Barrymore childishly kissed E. T., a guy from outer space. The actress is
                        now about to publish her autobiography—by no means a small
                        achievement at sweet 17—and, of course, it is to be entitled <hi rend="i">Little
Girl Lost.</hi></p>
          <p>All this testifies to a qualitative leap in the propagation of Blake’s
                        works and their canonization that could hardly have been foreseen when, in
                        1977 and as a neophyte in bibliographical research, I first became involved
                        with the compilation of this continuing report on the state of affairs in
                        Blake scholarship. The 1990-92 checklist is to be the last for which I take
                        responsibility as the compiler; therefore, some introductory remarks
                        addressing the present, past, and future of this serialized research report
                        may be permitted, if not required.</p>
          <p>Compared to the thousands of publications that are cited annually in the
                        updates to the Shakespeare bibliography, the 525 main entries in the 1989-91
                        list of Blake-related materials appear to signal no more than a fairly
                        modest critical interest in the works of William Blake and his
                        contemporaries. If, however, one thinks of Bentley’s <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>
as a standard, an almost monstrous growth in the
                        generation and regeneration of Blake-related studies becomes evident. In
                        1977 Gerald Bentley listed fewer than 3000 publications on Blake since the
                        eighteenth century. At the present rate, and taking for a measure the
                        entries in part I of the checklist for volume 25, this number will have
                        doubled in no more than 15 years. To cope with such a mass of previously
                        published information on Blake’s works, scholars will increasingly
                        have to depend on periodically updated bibliocritical information.</p>
          <p>The advent of the CD-ROM (compact disk/read-only-memory) version of the <hi rend="i">MLA
International Bibliography</hi> may seem to answer these
                        needs precisely. True enough, this electronic compendium renders large
                        proportions of the entries in a printed checklist that only consists of
                        authors’ names, titles, and publication data virtually obsolete.
                        However, Blake worked as a poet <hi rend="i">and</hi> as an artist; in
                        consequence, at least some Blake-related studies are likely to be published
                        in art journals that are not searched by the MLA team, and with the 
<hi rend="i">Bibliography of the History of Art</hi> (<hi rend="i">BHA</hi>,
                        formerly <hi rend="i">RILA</hi> and its French counterpart) a second source
                        of information will still have to be tapped in any thorough bibliographical
                        search. The Wilsondisk CD-ROM program offers an astonishing variety of
                        search facilities for the <hi rend="i">MLA Bibliography.</hi> One may
                        “browse” for authors, titles, subjects, or periods, and the
                        system’s “Wilsearch” function allows for boolean
                        searches. However, and by necessity, the number of classified subjects that
                        are easily and effectively accessible on disk remains limited, and the
                        information retrieved from disk often remains critically unilluminating.</p>
          <p>A future continuation of “Blake and His Circle” is not quite as
                        futile then as, at first sight and in the present computer-crazy situation,
                        it may seem. True, much of the strictly bibliographical,
                        “hard” information in my successor’s checklists will
                        probably be redundant by the time it actually becomes available in print.
                        Nevertheless, the checklist may still, and largely on account of the
                        abstracts and critical annotations it presents, function as a highly
                        important service to the readers of this journal. However, a further shift
                        in focus—from mere data toward the critical apparatus that
                        accompanies them—appears to be unavoidable. Only a few years ago, the
                        annotations used to be scarcely more than a suffix to the entries proper; in
                        the future, they will have to be considered as central to—and, in
                        practice, the <hi rend="i">raison d’être</hi> of—the
                        whole endeavor.</p>
          <p>Whereas it is impossible, or at least a waste of valuable printing space, to
                        return to that simple listing of books, articles, and reviews that we began
                        with in the 1970s, an annual bibliography with full critical annotations to
                        all the entries would be enormously useful, might save a vast amount of
                        time, and would be a major achievement for its compiler. Reviews are not
                        covered by the <hi rend="i">MLA Bibliography</hi> at all, and they are
                        notoriously difficult to locate in any systematic way. At least some
                        reviews, however, do present important factual information and/or critical
                        insights. As a whole they are indicative of the intellectual climate that
                        governs the scholarly discourse of a given period, and their accessibility
                        will thus be important for any future attempt to understand the critical
                        response to Blake’s works in that period. Therefore, I consider their
                        inclusion 
<pb id="p26-77" n="77"/>
in “Blake and His Circle”
                        an increasingly essential feature.</p>
          <p>My own attempts to fulfill the demands made on the compiler of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>’s
checklist have continually been frustrated. I may
                        say that I have spent a lot of time writing these checklists, and yet I
                        found that it never was enough. I have regularly searched well over 500
                        journals in the fields of aesthetics, art history, book collecting and
                        publishing history, critical theory, historical studies, British and
                        international literary criticism, politics and sociology for Blake-related
                        essays and reviews. And I have found that these never were enough (or what I
                        had to work with was the wrong selection of journals for my particular
                        needs). I have certainly learned a lot from browsing through all these
                        publications, but never felt that I had gained access to more than, say, 85%
                        of the relevant material. If it was anyone other than Gerald Bentley who was
                        now destined to take over as bibliographer, I should have advised the
                        appointment of an entire team of compilers. Such a team might have stood a
                        better chance than I of reaching that elusive ideal of bibliographical
                        completeness, and it may even have been able to present the well-balanced
                        critical account that some readers (and authors) have found to be wanting in
                        my annotations and short reviews.</p>
          <p>To return to the present list: my annotations range from the austere
                        one-sentence note to a near-review. Usually, these short takes have been
                        based on the authors’ own statements concerning the critical purpose
                        and the results of their work. Thus, I have again attempted to provide
                        readers first with a more or less dispassionate summary of the contents of
                        the articles and books that are listed. Yet while the emphasis is put on the
                        descriptive, my annotations, especially those that have grown into brief
                        mentions or miniature reviews, do not steer entirely clear of the critical.
                        In writing my annotations, I have, in effect, employed what the professional
                        bibliographer might feel tempted to describe as an incongruous pairing of
                        paraphrase and commentary (see James L. Harner, <hi rend="i">On Compiling an
                            Annotated Bibliography</hi> [New York, NY: Modern Language Association
                        of America, 1985] 22-23). This, of course, endangers the
                        “neutral” and “objective” character that is
                        commonly (though fictionally) associated with the scholarly sub-genre of the
                        bibliographical checklist. Here and there my rather grumbling and bickering
                        nature must certainly be in evidence, and all I can hope is that even in my
                        nagging, readers will find some interest, or some amusement, or maybe (if
                        that ain’t asking too much) both.</p>
          <p>However, since brevity may make me appear even more intolerant than I really
                        am, I should like to point out that, over the years, I have learned a great
                        deal, in both fact and theory, from almost all the authors I have
                        encountered. And though in many of my particular criticisms I may have
                        seemed ungrateful, I now wish to stress my general indebtedness to all the
                        fellow-workers in the ever-expanding field of literary, art historical, and
                        historical research concerned with one or the other aspect of “Blake
                        and His Circle.”</p>
          <p>In lieu of a <hi rend="i">subject index</hi> to the present research report,
                        the following outline of some major trends in the critical and scholarly
                        literature that is recorded in <hi rend="i">Part I</hi>, below, may be
                        useful. Of the various new <hi rend="i">editions</hi> of Blake’s
                        writings and images, only the new series launched by the Blake Trust is of
                        major importance for the scholar (see #8-9). However, for readers outside
                        the English-speaking world, a steadily increasing number of translations
                        supplies a first introduction to Blake’s poetry (see #1-3, 5-6, 10,
                        and 378). The most important addition to the <hi rend="i">bibliographical
                            resources</hi> available to the Blake scholar certainly is the CD-ROM
                        version of all the entries recorded in the <hi rend="i">MLA International
                            Bibliography</hi> from 1980 to the present (see above and #28, below).
                        The only <hi rend="i">catalogue</hi> of major importance that is recorded
                        below is Essick’s <hi rend="i">Commercial Engravings</hi>, a must for
                        any research library, and a book that many readers will want to add to their
                        Blake reference shelf.</p>
          <p>Finally, there is a new <hi rend="i">biography</hi> of Blake (see #147,
                        below). Unfortunately, it is not the one that I and, judging from the first
                        few reviews I have seen (#505), at least some others have been waiting for.
                        Blake’s life, his influence, and the sources that tell us about both
                        have also been studied in a number of shorter articles (see, e.g., #48-49,
                        108, 119-20). Blake’s <hi rend="i">revolutionary inclinations</hi>,
                        especially during the 1790s, are presently being studied with fresh
                        momentum, and a new understanding of Blake’s radical position is
                        unfolding. The artisan-poet is increasingly seen not only as a critic of the
                        bourgeois establishment, but also of the enlightened middle-class radicalism
                        of the Johnson circle (see #53, 66, 74, 107, 140, 173-74, 215, 220, and
                        224-25). And alongside Tom Paine (see #107, 173, 220, 317 and 319), Edmund
                        Burke is reemerging as a consequential figure for an understanding of
                        Blake’s works (see, e.g., #53, 92, 173, or 235).</p>
          <p>Blake’s ways with women, his <hi rend="i">gender-related themes</hi>,
                        and the treatment of figures such as Thel and Oothoon are principal themes
                        in the literature recorded below (see #42, 93, 113, 122, 128, 159, 203, 221,
                        223, and 234; for the biographical context, see #108, for the biblical
                        paintings #135). To these will soon be added Helen Bruder’s witty and
                        brilliantly argued examination of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> in the
                        hands and minds of its (male) interpreters. (This paper is to be published
                        in 1993 as part of <hi rend="i">Historicizing Blake</hi>, a collection of
                        essays that has been edited by David Worrall and Steve Clark for Macmillan.)
                        Most important among this year’s studies of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> are
Lincoln’s edition of the King’s College
                        copy (see #8) and Phillips’s reconstruction of a printing sequence
                        (see #199), to which may be added some more particularized studies (see #42,
                        56, 197, 214, 228, or 231). <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> and the other Lambeth
                        prophecies, which for quite some time have been 
<pb id="p26-78" n="78"/>
                        marginalized in Blake scholarship, form another sub-center of attraction
                        among the publications that are recorded below (see #45, 84, 103, 134, 156,
                        172-73, 192, 207, 211, and 223-25). <hi rend="i">Vala, or The Four Zoas</hi>
                        continues to attract a great deal of the critical ingenuity invested in the
                        understanding of Blake’s writings (see #39-41, 114, 191, and 211).
                        Except for Paley’s pictorial edition, no major new interpretations of
                            <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> have been offered in the period here under
                        review (but see #138, 146, and 226).</p>
          <p>Another cardinal point of 1990-92 Blake scholarship is the artist’s
                        approach to the <hi rend="i">illustration</hi> of the Bible (see #124, 135,
                        and 178), of Dante (see #183 and 232), Milton (see #91, 113, 115, 156, and
                        J. M. Q. Davies’s book on <hi rend="i">Blake’s Milton Designs:
                            The Dynamics of Meaning</hi> that is to be published by the end of
                        1992), Young (see #77, 124, and 227), or Gray (see #165). Shorter articles
                        are devoted to the further clarification of Blake’s visual and
                        literary sources (see #47, 86, 106, and 193-94).</p>
          <p>The experience of the modern metropolis as theme and challenge for Blake
                        supplies the subject for a small group of critical studies (see #161-62,
                        213, 250). The peculiar demands made upon the <hi rend="i">reader-viewers</hi> of the
illuminated books and of Blake’s
                        series of watercolor designs to the writings of earlier poets continue to
                        attract considerable critical attention (see #45, 54, 77-78, 91, 165, or
                        227).</p>
          <p>Blake’s use of the authors of <hi rend="i">antiquity</hi> is studied
                        by Bentley (#48), Downes (#96), and Richey (#210), his use of the Bible by
                        Hoagwood (#127), Imamura (#134), Ludwig (#163), and Yogev (#237). Recent 
<hi rend="i">comparative studies</hi> examine or re-examine the literary
                        relationships between the works of Blake and those of Herbert (#226),
                        Kierkegaard (#81), Wordsworth (#44, 88, 153), Shelley (#158 and 179),
                        Emerson (#187), Melville (#218), Nietzsche (#57), Yeats (#55 and 202), Wells
                        (#97), Joyce (#75), Lawrence (#221 and 233), O’Neill (#43), or Lacan
                        (#166). Together with Essick’s catalogue (#24), Parker’s
                        dissertation on the commercial <hi rend="i">engravings</hi> (#196) may be
                        said to open up a new field for further investigation. Other areas of
                        Blake’s productions as a visual artist are not particularly well
                        represented (see, however, #94, 104, 124, 135, 232).</p>
          <p>Generally speaking, Blake’s steadily growing recognition in the world
                        of academe is reflected in the number of <hi rend="i">dissertations</hi>
                        recorded below. Ironically, at least some of these attack the
                        institutionalization of the poet-artist, a process in which (and by
                        necessity) any dissertation participates, and from which their authors (with
                        or without knowing it) hope to profit in the end.</p>
          <p>The majority of the entries in <hi rend="i">part II</hi> has been filed under
                        the names of the artists and authors treated. This arrangement and the small
                        number of entries under most of these subheadings render any additional
                        comment on the contents of this section superfluous. Besides some odds and
                        ends such as the Blake Tarot and a theater program with translations of
                        Blake’s poems (#367 and 378), the “Miscellany” section
                        at the end of part II mostly consists of materials relating to the
                        biographical, historical, and critical study of some influential Blake
                        collectors and scholars. On the whole, this section is still abundant with
                        contributions on the late Northrop Frye, and I continue to list at least
                        some of the reviews of his books if the latter have been included in
                        previous issues of “Blake and His Circle.” Readers that are
                        specifically interested in Frye and his paramount contribution to the study
                        of English romanticism are advised to turn to the bibliographic updates that
                        are published at regular intervals in the <hi rend="i">Northrop Frye
                            Newsletter.</hi> In the future, this publication should render the
                        inclusion of Fryeana in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>’s own checklists
                        obsolete.</p>
          <p>Despite some personal inclination to the opposite, I have decided to
                        virtually exclude from part II studies that may be relevant for a better
                        historical understanding of Blake’s social, political, and
                        ideological position in his own times such as D. G. Wright’s <hi rend="i">Popular
Radicalism: The Working Class Experience,
                            1770-1880</hi> (1988), or the electoral case studies presented by James
                        E. Bradley in his <hi rend="i">Religion, Revolution, and English Radicalism:
                            Nonconformity in Eighteenth-Century Politics and Society</hi> (1990). In
                        order to keep abreast of current trends in the writing of eighteenth- and
                        nineteenth-century history, those who wish to gauge historically the
                        findings of, say, Mee’s study of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Dangerous Enthusiasm</hi>
(#173) will certainly have to turn to more
                        specialized sources of information. Similarly, I have rejected most of the
                        entries I had initially prepared for studies of the literary productions by
                        some of Blake’s early biographers and cataloguers such as Arthur
                        Symons or Darrell Figgis (some, however, remain; see #385-86).</p>
          <p>In <hi rend="i">Part III</hi> I have once again supplied cross-references to
                        the initial entries for the books under review. This system presents a minor
                        problem only where entries in the previous checklist number of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>
are concerned (see the respective note at the end of the
                        “Corrigenda” section, below). Cross-references in the style of
                        “26#134” are to items that are listed for the first time in
                        the present issue.</p>
          <p>Finally, a word about some of the publications that are now said to be
                        forthcoming and that have not yet been mentioned above. Morris Eaves’
                            <hi rend="i">The Counter-Arts Conspiracy: Art and Industry in the Age of
                            Blake</hi> (Cornell UP) and Molly Anne Rothenberg’s <hi rend="i">‘Chaos
Brightend’: Re-Thinking Blakean Textuality</hi> (U
                        of Missouri P) ought to be available by the end of 1992. It seems very
                        likely that, on account of its impact on the foundations of almost all the
                        assumptions concerning Blake’s working processes and their meaning,
                        Joseph Viscomi’s <hi rend="i">Blake and the Idea of the Book</hi>
                        (Princeton UP, 1993) will rank as the most important monograph in the
                        checklist for 1993-94. That period may also witness the publication of
                        Harriet Kramer Linkin’s study of Blake and Herbert, of Fred
                        Dortort’s <hi rend="i">The Dialectic of Vision: A New Reading of
                            Blake’s</hi> Jerusalem, <pb id="p26-79" n="79"/>
as well as of
                        Sheila Spector’s <hi rend="i">Christian Hebraism: A Source Book of
                            English Language Materials.</hi> Unlike the aforementioned titles, a new
                        series that has been announced for publication later this year (i.e., 1992)
                        seems a rather useless addition to the literature currently available to the
                        student of Blake. The Reprint Services Corporation of Irvine plans to offer
                        Sampson’s edition of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Poetical Works</hi>
                        (apparently the 1914 impression rather than the first edition of 1913), the
                        1926 Sloss and Wallis edition of <hi rend="i">The Prophetic Writings of
                            William Blake</hi>, the Nonesuch edition of Milton’s <hi rend="i">Poems in
English</hi> with reproductions of Blake’s watercolors
                        (1926), and Dorothy Plowman’s facsimile edition of Blake’s <hi rend="i">The Book
of Urizen</hi> (1929) in what are—if one takes
                        the antiquarian market for a standard—ridiculously over-priced
                        reprints.</p>
          <p>As regards the <hi rend="i">style of documentation</hi> and the principles of
                            <hi rend="i">coverage</hi> employed in the present checklist, the
                        following note will be sufficient. As explained in earlier checklists, the
                        presentation of the bibliographical data for each of the entries adheres to
                        the rules of the Modern Language Association. (The few discrepancies between
                            <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>’s house style and <hi rend="i">The MLA
                            Style Manual</hi> have been pointed out in the introduction to the
                        1986-87 compilation, for which see <hi rend="i">ante</hi>, volume 21.) This
                        is a research report, not a descriptive bibliography. Therefore, the terms
                        “boards” and “paper” have been applied to simply
                        indicate a hardbound or a softcover edition, regardless whether the former
                        is draped in full morocco, in genuine cloth, in marbled paper boards, or
                        merely in paste-boards laminated with some glossy paper, and whether the
                        latter is a classic paperback or clad in strong but flexible paper with a
                        plastic lamination. The book prices quoted are usually based on information
                        supplied by the publishers themselves, either directly or in the CD-ROM
                        edition of <hi rend="i">Books in Print.</hi> Unfortunately, what formerly
                        was an Italian speciality, the annual <hi rend="i">aumento</hi> of prices,
                        nowadays has become a practice common to the majority of publishers
                        worldwide. Therefore, by the time this list appears in print, many of the
                        retail prices may already have been increased. While a few of the listings
                        draw attention to previously overlooked publications of the past decade, the
                        majority of the books and articles recorded below saw the light of print in
                        the period between summer 1990 and summer 1992.</p>
          <p>For most of the research that went into the production of the 1990-92
                        checklist, I had to rely on the bibliographical facilities offered by, and
                        on the holdings of, the university library at Trier. For a few weeks in the
                        fall of 1991, however, I had the privilege of making use of the reference
                        shelves at the Henry E. Huntington Library. There I was able to examine both
                        the earlier volumes and the current issues of many specialized journals that
                        are usually unavailable to me at Trier. I am particularly grateful to
                        Jenijoy La Belle and Robert Essick for their unsurpassed hospitality during
                        that period.</p>
          <p>As has become the custom, Robert Essick has also assisted me in the
                        compilation of this list in many other ways. He has kindly placed at my
                        disposal the holdings of his private collection and the unique resources of
                        his magnificent Blake reference library. Numerous letters that we have
                        exchanged over the past months and the pile of photocopies he has sent to
                        Germany make him virtually the co-compiler of what is presented below under
                        my name alone. Without the shared enthusiasm and the unrestricted generosity
                        of this friend, the present version of “Blake and His Circle,”
                        like previous ones, would have turned out considerably more fragmentary than
                        it is. However, and this almost goes without saying, the responsibility for
                        any omissions, for faulty or incomplete citations and lack of consistency,
                        as well as for any erroneous evaluations, is all my own.</p>
          <p>Copy-editing a typescript of near-330 pages, searching it for flaws in style
                        of presentation, for errors in the indexing of the bibliographical data or
                        in the use of cross-references, attempting to eliminate at least the wildest
                        of my Germanicisms, all this must be a job that eats one’s brain. To
                        Morris Eaves, Morton Paley and, in particular, Patricia Neill I have, over
                        the years, accumulated an enormous debt of gratitude. Without their
                        indulgence, their perseverance, and their editorial expertise, all of my
                        checklists would have been half as useful as I hope they have proved to be
                        in the published versions.</p>
          <p>Thanks are also due to those publishers of Blake-related books that have
                        supplied me with inspection copies of their publications. In addition, I
                        would like to acknowledge the important contribution made by many friends
                        and colleagues who have sent offprints from their articles, who have pointed
                        out recent book publications, or who have (alas, all too seldom) drawn my
                        attention to publications inadvertently omitted from previous editions of
                        this ongoing report. I am much obliged for such help to Kiyoshi Ando, A. A.

            <p>1. Abitbol, Joelle, ed. and trans. <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi>:
                            L’Évangile éternel/The Everlasting Gospel. Le

            <p>—This bilingual edition comes without an introduction or any
                            explanatory textual notes. One searches in vain for an identification of
                            the English language edition from which the poem and its arrangement
                            have been adopted by the translator. Abitbol has not attempted to retain
                            Blake’s spelling and punctuation. The text is here presented in
                            eight “chapters,” numbered I-VIII, which correspond to the
                            following sequence of the Notebook fragments: supplementary passages 2
                            and 1 are Abitbol’s chapters I and II, which are followed by
                            sections i, a, d, e, b, and f as chapters III-VIII. Probably the
                            selective text in this edition is identical with that in the 1981
                            printing, published by Tastet’s Éditions Vrac; see

            <p>—Preceded by the editor’s introduction, entitled “Un
                            Espion de Dieu” (7-17), a selection from Blake’s lyric and
                            epic poetry is here presented in English, with Boutang’s
                            translations on the facing pages. One finds “Auguries of
                            Innocence” (22-31), a selection from the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>
                            (32-56), a few of the Notebook fragments (60-67), the
                            “Preludium” to <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (68-71),

                            (164-77). The edition is rounded off with short bio- and bibliographical
                            statements (179-85). For an earlier (and critical) discussion of the
                            merits of Boutang’s translations of Blake into French see the
                            translation of a 1971 letter by Pierre Leyris to the editor of <hi rend="i">Le

            <p>4. Butter, P. H., ed. <hi rend="i">William Blake: Selected Poems.</hi>
                            Everyman’s Library [1125]. Rev. ed. London: Dent; Rutland, VT:
                            Tuttle, 1991.</p>
            <p>—This selection was first published in 1982 and afterwards
                            reprinted without changes in 1986, 1988, and 1989; see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 17
(1983-84): 62 (#2). It has now been republished in a
                            “revised” version in which “have been added <hi rend="i">The Song of
Los</hi>, . . .; a few short poems and prose
                            extracts.” The text has been corrected in a few cases, and
                            “the notes have been revised” (xxix) by the editor. The
                            history of the Everyman’s text of Blake’s poetry is
                            somewhat complicated. Ever since 1927, when Max Plowman’s edition
                            of <hi rend="i">The Poems and Prophecies</hi> was first included in the
                            series, a selection from Blake’s writings has been part of
                            Everyman’s Library as published by Dent in London and Dutton in
                            New York. Plowman had previously played a major role in editing 
<hi rend="i">Vala</hi> for Keynes’s 1925 edition of the <hi rend="i">Writings</hi>, he had written 
<hi rend="i">An Introduction
                                to the Study of William Blake</hi> for Dent (1927), and was thus
                            well qualified for selecting what might have been termed
                            “Everyman’s Centenary Edition.” At the same time,
                            Plowman and his publishers were involved in the production of a series
                            of facsimiles of the illuminated books, and it adds to the
                            attractiveness of the 1927 and 1934 printings of the Everyman’s
                            edition that it contains, on a stock of special printing paper, a
                            facsimile of <hi rend="i">For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise.</hi>
                            From 1959 onwards, Plowman’s selection was reprinted with a
                            “supplementary note, select bibliography [newly revised in 1963],
                            and revisions to the notes by Geoffrey Keynes.” From 1975 until
                            at least 1984 copies of the text of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Poems
                                and Prophecies</hi> as established by Plowman were issued by Dent
                            with a new introduction by Kathleen Raine. With this edition still in
                            print, the same publishers in 1982 issued Butter’s edition of
                            Blake’s <hi rend="i">Selected Poems</hi> in the Everyman’s
                            series which takes for its “base text Max Plowman’s
                            edition of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Poems and Prophecies</hi>”
                            (1982 ed.: xxix). Such confusion, however, does not end here. At
                            present, one is given a choice between this newly revised 1991
                            Everyman’s edition of Butter’s version of Plowman’s
                            text and a 1991 collector’s edition of Plowman’s text,
                            issued by a different publisher under the same series title, complete
                            with an entirely new version of Raine’s introduction—and
                            the notes to the text as revised in 1959! Future collectors, if no one
                            else, ought to be delighted by the rich possibilities that are being
                            offered by the labyrinthine publishing history of what might easily be
                            misunderstood as just one edition which has been reprinted some 15 times
                            or so. See also #12, below.</p>

                            It.: Tirrenia Stampatori, 1989. Lit. 32000 paper.</p>
            <p>—This is another serviceable edition of Blake’s shorter
                            poems for the Italian reader. The editor has supplied a lengthy and
                            generally well-informed introduction on “La vita e le
                            opere” (11-25), the life and works of the poet, on his thought,
                            “Il pensiero” (27-42), “Le poesie” (43-57),
                            on “La metrica” and “La lingua” of the poems
                            (59-66 and 67-69). The “Bibliografia” (71-77) of editions,
                            biography, and criticism is followed by the English texts (taken from
                            Keynes) of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, some of the poems from the
                            Notebook and from the Pickering Manuscript. There are no Italian
                            translations of the texts, but for each poem Cerutti identifies the
                            characteristics of its poetic form (verse meter, rhythm, rhyme scheme),
                            points out its “contrary state,” gives a brief description
                            of the illumination that accompanies the poem under discussion (for the
                                <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> only), and supplies explanatory notes for
                            those expressions 
<pb id="p26-81" n="81"/>
and textual passages he
                            thinks most difficult to understand for the reader. Thus, it is
                            certainly easy enough to recommend the edition for use at Italian
                            universities and as a companion volume to Sanesi’s edition of the
                                <hi rend="i">Libri profetici</hi> (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 22
                            [1988-89]: 40 [#11-12]). However, it has to be said that the price of
                            Cerutti’s book (probably on account of the printing of only a
                            small number of copies) compares unfavorably with that of
                            Stevenson’s complete edition in the Longman’s Annotated
                            English Poets series (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 25 [1991-92]: 7-8

            <p>—This is a small selection from Blake’s poetry in Danish
                            translation on 80 (unpaginated) pages. As I cannot now remember any
                            other edition of Blake’s writings in this language except for Kai
                            Friis Møller’s translation of <hi rend="i">Thels Bog</hi>
                            with other poems that was published back in 1945 and Niels

                            219), even a much-belated entry for this publication seems worthwhile.
                            Some 20 of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> are followed by five Notebook
                            poems, <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>, and, an

                            Blake’s illuminated pages are reproduced in murky black and

                            extensive notes on the poetry and the designs. These accompany a
                            typographical version of the text of the poems that has been newly
                            transcribed from the copy reproduced. The general editor for this new
                            series of reproductions of “Blake’s Illuminated
                            Books,” inaugurated by the Blake Trust in 1987, is David Bindman.

            <p>—This is the first volume of a “Collected Edition”
                            of Blake’s books in illuminated printing that, if all goes well,
                            will be completed in five volumes of uniform format in 1994 and will
                            then function as a tool of major importance in the workshop of every
                            serious student of Blake’s art and poetry. Volumes 1 and 2 are
                            now available, and they call for at least a preliminary assessment of
                            their status in relation with the earlier series of Blake Trust
                            facsimiles that were published by the Trianon Press from 1951 onwards.
                            Such a comparison, instead of being shunned, is explicitly invited by
                            the present council of the Trust, its editors and the publishers. And
                            can it be a mere accident that the new series should now be opened with
                            reproductions of copy E of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> from the Paul
                            Mellon collection and a late and splendidly colored copy of the 
<hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, when that same copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and the late richly hand-tinted copy Z
of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> were the first of the illuminated books
                            reproduced in the Trust’s earlier series of Trianon Press
                            facsimiles? While “always . . . full of sympathy” with the
                            “dissatisfied readers” of typographical editions of
                            Blake’s writings, the late Sir Geoffrey Keynes, one of the
                            founders of the William Blake Trust and for 30 years its driving force,
                            was firmly convinced “that any inexpensive reproduction in black
                            and white or in color” of Blake’s works in illuminated
                            printing “would be so unlike the original colored prints that no
                            one would be satisfied” (Geoffrey Keynes, “The William
                            Blake Trust,” <hi rend="i">William Blake: Essays for S. Foster
                                Damon</hi>, ed. Alvin H. Rosenfeld [Providence, RI: Brown UP, 1969]
                            414). Though Keynes’s distinction between a genuine facsimile as
                            contrasted to a “mere” reproduction still holds true, one
                            may wonder what the Trust’s former chairman would have thought of
                            this new pictorial edition of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, copy E, and
                            its companion volume (see the preceding entry).</p>
            <p>The dilemma inherent in Sir Geoffrey’s position (in part a result
                            of the technical processes available for high-quality color
                            reproductions in the late 1940s and 1950s), is poignantly addressed in
                            the “General Editor’s Preface” to the present
                            volume. Taking up the argument where Keynes had left it, David Bindman
                            writes about the series of Trianon Press facsimiles that
                            “inevitably, given the laborious and highly skilled nature of
                            their production, . . . were costly and printed only in relatively small
                            numbers. Their very success as private press books had the ironic effect
                            of undermining the principal intention behind their production; instead
                            of being widely available they became collectors’ items and, for
                            librarians, precious volumes to be consigned to the same rare-book
                            shelves as the unique volumes from which they were reproduced. In 1987 .
                            . . it was agreed by the present council of the Blake Trust that the aim
                            of the founders—to make the Illuminated books widely accessible
                            in high-quality reproductions—had not yet been realized: however,
                            developments in methods of reproduction and printing had now made its
                            achievement feasible.” The differences between the Trust’s
                            own 1951 facsimile of copy E of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (Paul Mellon
                            collection) and the 1991 publication are described by Bindman in the
                            following terms: “This edition of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> is,
                            even allowing for the inevitable compromises all reproduction entails,
                            as accurate as modern technology and expert checking at every stage can
                            make it. If the result lacks the beguiling versimilitude of the
                            hand-coloured Trianon Press facsimiles it is, we believe, more accurate
                            in detail and less subjective in rendering the colouring of
                            Blake’s original” (6). Over the past three or four years,
                            antiquarian copies of the 1951 publication have regularly been priced
                            somewhere between $1100 and $3000, and this seems sufficient proof of
                            the credibility of Bindman’s account of the “ironic
                            effect” of the limited editions on the Trust’s
                            “express purpose of making Blake’s Illuminated books more
                            widely known.” At the same time, however, it makes his claims for
                            the reliability of the results of more modern “methods of
                            reproduction” that sell at less than $100 seem utterly hopeless.
                            And yet, having made a detailed comparison of the plates in my copy of
                            the 1951 facsimile and in the new Blake Trust edition, I find that much
                            to my surprise these claims are generally justified.</p>
            <p>It is easy, of course, to fault the 1991 version of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, copy E, on
account of its lacking the
                            “tactile” qualities and the luminosity of color which can
                            only be produced by the application of genuine watercolors to a special
                            make of paper that resembles eighteenth-century papers in its texture.
                            It is true, too, that the 1991 version stands no chance where it comes
                            to the reproduction of the gold that Blake and subsequently the
                            colorists at the Trianon workshops applied to some of the images. If,
                            however, one thinks of the color reproductions predominantly in terms of
                            their possible usefulness as a scholarly tool, and if therefore one is
                            prepared to leave such “beguiling versimilitude” aside,
                            one will soon become aware of the particular strengths of the new
                            reproductions. Even the most complex gradations 
<pb id="p26-82" n="82"/>
                            of a single color are rendered with astonishing fidelity and with an
                            overall result at least equal to that in the 1951 facsimile. (One may
                            look, for example, at the two alternative reproductions of the various
                            qualities of red which, on the book’s title page, the artist
                            employed for a background to the name “Jerusalem.”) In
                            many of the plates, particularly those where Blake’s words,
                            rather than his figures, dominate a page of the illuminated book, the
                            coloring is in fact almost identical in both editions (see, e.g., pls.
                            12, 58, 60, 68, or 72; however, though it is also densely covered by the
                            lines of the text with only a few marginal decorations, pl. 13 comes off
                            considerably darker in the new edition than in the old). The intricate
                            interplay of the basic printing color with different washes of
                            watercolor has often been captured more clearly here than in the earlier
                            facsimile (see, e.g., the upper right section of pl. 28). Most
                            important, I think, is the superior legibility of Blake’s work
                            with pen (or small brush) and ink in the Paley edition. The
                            interpretation and recreation of Blake’s inked outlines as well
                            as of the etched words and punctuation by the facsimilists at the
                            Trianon Press must have been even more “subjective” than
                            that of the rendering of the colors in Blake’s original. Minute
                            details in copy E, such as the artist-author’s strengthening of
                            an occasional page number, have now been well reproduced for the first
                            time (see, e.g., pls. 22 or 25, as well as the inked lines at the bottom
                            of pl. 56 that reproduce quite clearly here whereas in my copy of the
                            1951 facsimile they have been virtually lost). The strengthened contours
                            of the faces of many of the larger figures can be seen quite clearly in
                            the new photographs that were taken for the present edition. Here it
                            does indeed come off as a considerably “more accurate”
                            reproduction than the partly hand-colored facsimile. (For example, one
                            may compare the reproductions of pls. 37, 46, 47, 50, 57, 74, 76, 81,
                            84, 94, 99-100 in the 1991 edition with those of the same plates in the
                            1951 facsimile.) The possible impact especially of these latter
                            improvements in Paley’s new edition of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> on a critical
understanding of Blake’s
                            imagery in the illuminated book can hardly be overestimated. The new
                            color reproductions of pls. 1-100 in copy E (which are augmented by five
                            additional illustrations of other copies of pls. 1 and 51) are then of a
                            very high, if not the highest possible quality. Had they been published
                            on their own, or accompanied by a brief bibliographical statement
                            similar to those in the Trust’s earlier facsimile publications,
                            there would still have been sufficient reason for urging readers of the
                            checklist to add this volume to their reference library. As it is, the
                            book has even more to offer and thus to recommend itself for acquisition
                            not only by the collector and the librarian—but at what is an
                            unusually fair price, by any serious student of Blake’s art and
                            poetry.</p>
            <p>Paley has newly studied Blake’s <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> in
                            detail. The results of his research have here been cast into a format
                            that includes a general introduction, “a new transcription of
                            Blake’s text and a full plate-by-plate commentary.” This
                            format, which is to remain more or less the same for the four other
                            volumes in the series, is intended to make highly specialized
                            scholarship “accessible to the less specialist reader”
                            (6). Now, while more specialist readers may entertain some critical
                            reservations here or there (after all, we are being paid for doing so),
                            Paley demonstrates in an altogether admirable way that the concept may
                            work. Drawing on his earlier monograph on <hi rend="i">The Continuing
                                City</hi> (Oxford, Oxon.: Clarendon P, 1983), Paley has contributed
                            a lucid introduction that securely anchors the work in its context
                            (9-16). He has then supplied a new typographical edition of copy E of
                                <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> that attempts “as close an
                            equivalent to Blake’s calligraphic text as possible” (126)
                            and is preceded by an exposition of the major editorial problems
                            encountered, and an exemplary account of the decisions made to solve
                            them (126-27). The letterpress text (130-297, set in roman) follows an
                            equally useful “Note on the Reversed Writing in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>”
(128-29). The commentary includes both the
                            editor’s textual notes (keyed to the text by line numbers) and a
                            descriptive analysis (set in italics) of the images. The latter
                            concentrates on questions of iconography, on verbal parallels in the
                            artist’s writings, on his pictorial sources, and on the more
                            important pictorial variants. I should think that it almost goes without
                            saying that this critical apparatus embodies a major improvement over
                            the commentary which had been offered by Joseph Wicksteed in his highly
                            idiosyncratic 1954 companion volume to the Trust’s 1951 and 1953
                            facsimiles of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi></p>
            <p>If I have any misgivings about Paley’s explanatory notes at all,
                            it is merely because there appears to have been not enough room for more
                            of them, and for more extensive discussions of the materials of graphic
                            meaning, of Blake’s handling of pictorial composition, the
                            effects of coloring in the figures as well as in the text areas, and of
                            the printed and drawn outlines. As they stand, these annotations
                            successfully pave the way for all detailed future interpretations of the
                            imagery in this “most complex” (6) of the illuminated
                            books, a task that as yet has hardly been begun. A substantial list of
                            “Works Cited” (298-302) rounds off an edition that is
                            extremely useful, handsomely produced, “truly accessible”
                            (if not to all then at least to many), and a major achievement for both
                            its editor and the publishers. A list of typographical errors as well as
                            a few <hi rend="i">addenda</hi> to the commentary and the list of works
                            consulted by the editor has recently been made available in the pages of
                            this journal (see #195, below). After all the praise bestowed on this
                            publication, one final warning is called for. As the co-editor of one of
                            the future volumes in the Trust’s new series, the present
                            reviewer is personally involved with and rather enthusiastic about this
                            publication project. Therefore, he may not be in a position to judge
                            impartially both the merits and the shortcomings of Paley’s and
                            Lincoln’s new editions. Critical readers of this report will want
                            to have a particularly close look at the books themselves.</p>

            <p>—For the intricacies in the publishing history of the
                            “Everyman’s” edition of Blake’s selected
                            writings, see my note to #4, above. In the present version, the text as
                            established by Max Plowman in 1927 is reprinted in the original
                            arrangement and, apparently, <hi rend="i">verbatim.</hi> However, I
                            failed in my attempt to locate any reference to Plowman’s
                            editorial labors in the book itself. While in 1991 the text and the
                            editorial principles employed to establish it may seem a little dated,
                            Kathleen Raine has contributed what appears to be an entirely new
                            introduction. It is here that one comes across the statement that the
                            “Keynes edition has since [1925] been the standard text through
                            which Blake has become known” (xii); the text that follows is,
                            however, not taken from Keynes. Raine’s introduction as a whole
                            (xi-xxxvi) is not identical with that in 1975-84 printings of the
                            “Everyman’s Library” edition, but it can still be
                            described as a condensed version of the arguments that are known from
                            the same author’s <hi rend="i">Blake and Tradition</hi> and <hi rend="i">Blake
and Antiquity</hi> (1968 and 1979). The introduction
                            is followed by a “Select Bibliography” (xxxviii-xxxix)
                            which includes a 1984 publication as the most recent study of Blake, and
                            an equally anonymous “Chronology” (xl-lxix) of the
                            “author’s life,” the “literary
                            context,” and “historical events.” The book is
                            attractively produced, is distributed by Random House, and can be
                            recommended as a wonderful present for either of the following two
                            classes of book lovers: those who prefer an uncluttered “reading
                            text” to a modern, annotated scholarly edition of Blake’s
                            writings, and the collectors who may happen to be interested in the
                            history of Blake editions.</p>

            <p>—Though only a very limited number of copies of this brochure have
                            been printed for the author, the existence of this bibliographical
                            report on Blake’s Japanese reputation is well worth mentioning
                            even before it has been incorporated into the forthcoming <hi rend="i">Blake Books
Supplement.</hi> Since 1980, when (for reasons not
                            known to me) Kasumitsu Watarai’s short-lived association with the
                            other compilers ended, the coverage of Japanese publications in 
<hi rend="i">Blake</hi>’s annual checklists of recent literature
                            has been less than superficial. This remains true with regard to the
                            present issue of “Blake and His Circle,” and I am
                            therefore very happy to be able to draw attention to Aoyama’s and
                            Bentley’s labor of love. “In general, this work is
                            organized as in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1977)” (iv), being
                            divided into separate parts and sections for “Editions of
                            Blake’s Writings” (1-4), “Reproductions of
                            Blake’s Art” (4-5, with an odd one-entry section of
                            “Illustrations of Individual Authors” on 5),
                            “Catalogues and Bibliographies” (5-8, including entries
                            for the two 1990 Blake shows at Tokyo), and “Criticism and
                            Scholarship” (8-73). Where appropriate, the entries have been
                            cross-referenced with Bentley’s <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> of
                            1977. The author’s “Preface” (ii-v) and
                            “Introduction” (vi-ix) supply a useful and interesting
                            account both of the peculiar difficulties presented by the subject of
                            such a bibliographical checklist and of the history and growth of Blake
                            scholarship in Japan. It is, in particular, the wealth of critical
                            studies recorded in part VI of <hi rend="i">Blake Studies in Japan</hi>,
                            that lends weight to the concluding remark in Bentley’s
                            introduction: “The extent of Japanese scholarship on Blake is so
                            prodigious that it is surely time for a meeting of scholars from east
                            and west to pool their knowledge and techniques for the profit of all.
                            Western scholars can no longer afford their parochial ignorance of this
                            enormous body of scholarship. For too long east has been east and west
                            has been west; it is time for the twain to meet” (ix). If I
                            should warn against one evident mistake in Bentley’s Japanese
                            supplement to <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, then it has to be accounted
                            for by the author’s modesty; in speaking of the enormous output
                            of “the most prodigious [Japanese] scholar of them all, Bunsho
                            Jugaku, [who] has thus far (1927-1990) produced some forty-seven works
                            related to William Blake,” Bentley states that the “only
                            western scholar who approaches this productivity is Sir Geoffrey
                            Keynes” (viii). However, since the times of Sir Geoffrey, members
                            of a younger generation of western Blake scholars, such as Essick and
                            Bentley himself (the latter with more than 80 Blake-related publications
                            to his credit) have established new standards. For mere mortals these
                            will be hard to meet in both the east and in the west. See also #37,

            <p>—In the section devoted to the study of individual authors,
                            readers of this annotated survey of eighteenth-century studies will find
                            a selective list of books, articles, and reviews concerned with Blake
                            that were published in the course of 1985. Since these have all been
                            listed previously in this checklist, the latest volume of this
                            not-so-current critical bibliography will be of interest primarily on
                            account of the concise reviews that accompany many of the listings. As
                            has become the custom for part III of “Blake and His
                            Circle,” these entries from Borck’s annual publication are
                            cited separately, below. There, the present volume is referred to in

            <p>—This well-produced catalogue accompanied a small exhibition shown
                            in New York (4 Nov.-31 Dec. 1992), organized by Lawrence B. Salander
                            (see [5-6]), and including loans from some major public collections such
                            as the Brooklyn Museum, the Fogg Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum,
                            the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Tate Gallery, as well as works
                            from various private collections in the United States. Butlin has
                            contributed a general introduction to “The Art of William
                            Blake” (9-12) that is followed by a reprint of Hamlyn’s
                            “William Blake: The Apprentice Years” (13-16; see #25,
                            below). The catalogue entries for the 31 works on show consist of
                            excerpts from Butlin 1981 and some other previously published
                            catalogues. There are 15 fine color plates, and all the other works are
                            reproduced in black and white. There are a few signs of hasty
                            preparation and sloppy copy-editing in the lists of exhibitions (75-77)
                            and of works cited (78-81), yet this does not distract from the visual
                            attractiveness of the catalogue publication.</p>

            <p>—There are 525 main entries in the previous checklist of materials
                            for the study of William Blake. The majority of the books, articles, and
                            reviews recorded were issued between fall 1989 and spring 1991. The
                            author’s occasionally ill-tempered annotations reflect (if
                            nothing else) the enormous pressure on anybody attempting to keep

                            another seem related to (though not always relevant for) the study of

            <p>—This present publication is soon to be reviewed in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, therefore,
relatively few words will suffice to draw
                            attention to its importance and usefulness. A considerable amount of the
                            work which went into the production of Blake’s poetry and of what
                            is described as his “original” drawings, paintings, and
                            engravings was financed and was thus made possible only by
                            Blake’s commissions for commercial “reproductive”
                            engravings after designs by other artists. Both the
                            “original” works and the “reproductive”
                            engravings were executed with the same tools and at the same working
                            table. This much granted, it seems only reasonable to assume that there
                            are also technical, formal, and iconographical characteristics shared by
                            the products of both of these realms of the poet-artist’s
                            activities. For the very first time, Essick’s catalogue allows
                            for a systematic investigation of such cross-currents. Since the early
                            1970s, Essick has not been idle in investigating this field, and he has
                            brought to the task his expertise in the history and technique of
                            printmaking and of publishing, as well as his far-ranging knowledge of
                            Blake’s entire oeuvre and his penetrating grasp on the
                            hermeneutics of graphic meaning. Therefore, as might have been expected,
                            this new catalogue is packed with information on previously unrecorded
                            states of the commercial engravings and with suggestive commentaries on
                            the relationship between the plates executed by Blake after the designs
                            of other artists and his own separate plates and the pages of his
                            illuminated books. With nearly 300 illustrations, the volume also
                            supplies for the first time a complete visual compendium of
                            Blake’s work as a reproductive engraver that should prove
                            extremely useful for future iconographic research. Alongside
                            Essick’s earlier study of Blake as a printmaker (1980) and his
                            catalogue raisonné of Blake’s separate plates (1983), <hi rend="i">Commercial
Book Illustrations</hi> immediately establishes
                            itself as a standard work of reference. Its acquisition is a must. No
                            serious student of Blake can fail to learn from the pages of this
                            catalogue.</p>
            <p>25. Hamlyn, Robin. <hi rend="i">William Blake: The Apprentice Years.</hi>
                            Exh. cat. London: Tate Gallery Publications, 1992. £1.00 paper.</p>
            <p>—This “broadsheet” of only eight pages was published
                            on the occasion of a studio exhibition, seen at the Tate 13 May-16 Aug.
                            1992. Hamlyn’s illustrated account of “The Apprentice
                            Years” ([3-7]) is followed by suggestions for “Further
                            Reading” and a “List of Works” on show ([7-8]). As
                            the author explains in his introduction, “<hi rend="i">The
                                Apprentice Years</hi> is the first in a series of special temporary
                            displays devoted to the work and times of . . . Blake. Occurring once a
                            year each display will concentrate on a different aspect of
                            Blake’s output and will use selected loans from public and
                            private collections to complement works from the Tate’s own
                            important Blake collection. The displays will follow a chronological
                            pattern.” Whereas Hamlyn’s text does indeed concentrate on
                            Blake’s “early years as an apprentice engraver,”
                            the 65 items on show included not only works by Blake’s master
                            Basire and some of his colleagues, but also various of Blake’s
                            watercolors and engravings from the 1820s. Though this may have puzzled
                            incidental visitors to the exhibition, these late works were obviously
                            added for both their visual appeal and in order to demonstrate
                            “the impact [his] training had on his later art and
                            career” [2]. This is a modest publication, published at a very
                            moderate price; it brings into focus what little information there is on
                            Blake’s beginnings as an artist and is well worth having for any
                            serious student of this period. A short announcement of the exhibition
                            (presumably written by the compiler of the catalogue) appeared in the
                                <hi rend="i">Tate Preview</hi> May-Aug. 1992: 18.</p>

                            Exh. cat. London: Tate Gallery, 1991.</p>
            <p>—This exhibition handlist was made available to visitors of the
                            Tate Gallery’s Blake show, which was “presented as part of
                            New Displays 1991” (1) from 10 July to 3 Nov. 1991 in the Lower
                            Galleries at Millbank. It had been briefly announced in the <hi rend="i">Tate
Preview</hi> May-Aug. 1991: 9. Before the advent of desktop
                            publishing, one would have described these unillustrated and stapled
                            pages as a “mimeographed” pamphlet. As it is, electronic
                            typesetting has allowed the author (Robin Hamlyn, whose name, however,
                            does not appear in this ephemeral publication) to pack an astonishing
                            amount of information into the 16 pages of his densely printed handout,
                            which had to function in lieu of a proper exhibition catalogue. There is
                            a short introduction (1) that is followed by brief descriptions of the
                            Blake exhibits (1-10). Among “Blake’s Followers”
                            one finds older contemporaries “whose paths crossed
                            Blake’s,” as well as those artists “with whom Blake
                            made enduring friendships” (1). Represented in this section were
                            his brother Robert (11), Edward Calvert (11-12), William Collins, Henry
                            Fuseli, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Charles Robert Leslie, John Linnell (12),
                            George Morland, John Opie (with a portrait whose sitter has been
                            tentatively identified as Mary Wollstonecraft), Samuel Palmer (13), Sir
                            Joshua Reynolds, George Richmond, George Romney, Charles Reuben Ryley,
                            William Bell Scott, Thomas Stothard (with his version of “The
                            Pilgrimage to Canterbury”), and James Ward (14-15). A special
                            highlight in this section was the Tate’s “Study for
                            Portrait II (after the Life Mask of William Blake),” painted in
                            1955 by the late Francis Bacon (11). A well-selected and generally
                            reliable “William Blake Reading List” (16) rounds off the
                            handlist. For the future, the Tate Gallery plans similar annual Blake
                            exhibitions on a small scale, each of which is to focus on the works
                            produced by the artist during a specific period. Here, selections from
                            the Tate Gallery’s own vast collection of Blakeana are to be
                            shown alongside loan materials from other museums. Also, these displays
                            are to be accompanied by inexpensive exhibition handlists (presumably to
                            be written by Hamlyn and published in a format similar to the present
                            one) that will be easily accesible to the gallery’s visitors.
                            (See the preceding entry for the catalogue that accompanied the first of
                            these special displays.) Blake’s “Fate at the
                            Tate,” then, may not seem to be quite as unfortunate as many
                            (myself included) assumed when the former Blake Room was closed down
                            (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 25 [1991-92]: 22 [#107]). However, the good
                            news of these temporal displays and the accompanying broadsheets is
                            thoroughly diminished by the bad news concerning a drastic change in the
                            opening hours of the Tate’s Study Room for works on paper. This
                            change, of course, was not heavily publicized, and yet it means that the
                            very best of the arguments that were presented by Hamlyn in the pleading
                            note he published in the spring 1989 issue of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>
                            are no longer valid. Whereas the Study Room used to be open to the
                            public six days a week from 10 a.m. until the museum’s closing
                            time (see, e.g., the back cover of the above mentioned issue of the 
<hi rend="i">Tate Preview</hi>), an appointment system has since been
                            resumed, and admission is presently granted in what I think is a
                            scandalously restrictive manner: Wednesdays only, 10.30 a.m. to 4.30
                            p.m. (see the back cover of the <hi rend="i">Tate Preview</hi> for
                            May-Aug. 1992). Readers who feel concerned about Blake’s
                            “Fate at the Tate” and the larger issues involved in the
                            debate over the <corr type="emend">accessibility</corr> of the holdings of this
collection may also
                            want to have a look at Robin Simon’s editorial “The War
                            between the Tate: The Fate of the Historic British Collection”
                            (unfortunately combining what is in my view his justified advocacy for
                            the historic collection with a brand of anti-modernism that sounds
                            dangerously reactionary and for which I have no sympathy), Nicholas
                            Serota’s rebuke, “The Dilemmas Facing the Tate: The
                            Director’s Reply” (which manages to circumvent rather than
                            to address what is at stake), Michael Kitson’s “In My View
                            . . . the Tate Gallery,” and a letter by Eric Shanes that is
                            complaining similarly about Serota’s presiding “over the
                            most disgraceful act of artistic philistinism that has ever occured at
                            the Tate Gallery,” an act which “has virtually cut off all
                            public access to . . . the Study Room” (63) and its Turner,

                            #3977-80 (431-32), Erasmus Darwin has a single mention as #4000 (433);
                            and so has Godwin with #4413 (477). While Hayley is not listed at all,
                            Sir Geoffrey Keynes is the subject of #4886-90 (525). There is no entry
                            for a Thomas Paine bibliography, but see #5554 and #5558 for Price and
                            Priestley (595-96), as well as #6522-24 for Wollstonecraft
                            (700)—a useful compilation, though already somewhat dated in the
                            period it covers.</p>

                            (#2223-77); and I also thought it relatively uninteresting. However, I
                            first learned of quite a number of Blake-related publications that are
                            reported below through the MLA’s bibliography for 1981-91 as it
                            is now

available on CD-ROM. Though even in
                            bibliographical studies I treasure the printed page more than any
                            computerized data base (with the usually narrow perspective of a single
                            catchword that it offers), I can only advise readers who are searching
                            urgently for current publications on a given aspect of the poet’s
                            work to make use of the electronic, rather than the printed, version of
                            the MLA’s bibliography. The former, with its more than 800 Blake
                            listings, appears to be more complete than the latter. However, despite
                            the “Wilsearch” function offered by the CD-ROM version, I
                            know of no electronic bibliography that allows one to shape personal
                            research strategies in the same measure provided by the printed annual
                            bibliography. The variety of possible uses that the MLA’s
                            “Classified Listings” offers still makes this printed
                            version an indispensable tool for serious and thorough research. On the

                            of the work invested in specialized bibliographical checklists virtually
                            obsolete. See also the “Introduction,” above.</p>

                            provided “the first opportunity to view a significant number of

                            Copley and Alan Bower provides a further supplement to this list. Here
                            one is offered one-paragraph short-takes on Bate’s study of

                            Thanks to the compiler’s efforts and the existence of the present

                            (with the exceptions of McGill and the University of Adelaide). Here,

                            to the call-numbers for 262 Blake-related prints, books, and catalogues
                            among the holdings of Cornell’s university library and the print
                            collection of the Johnson Museum. Keyed to Bentley 1977, one finds
                            entries for Blake’s “Book Illustrations and Original

                            typographical errors, and there are only minor inconsistencies in the
                            presentation of the data. Occasionally an author’s or
                            editor’s initial for her or his middle name has been lost from
                            the record, or in another case an author’s first name has been
                            abbreviated by use of initials only, or an initial has been translated
                            into the author’s full name, though this does not appear on the
                            book’s title page (see, e.g., #151, 158, and 227). By no means
                            ought this to lessen the student’s gratefulness for the

              <p>—Part one of this new collection of (previously published)
                                essays and sections of books selected by Adams from the critical
                                literature presents “Blake in His Time.” It comprises
                                excerpts from the writings of Cunningham, Robert Hunt, Palmer, and
                                Crabb Robinson, and it is introduced by the reprint of the second
                                chapter in Deborah Dorfman’s 1969 publication. Part two
                                examines the critical understanding of “Blake in Our
                                Time” in 10 essays. The editor has chosen reprints of
                                articles by David V. Erdman (53-66), Robert N. Essick (175-92),
                                Susan Fox (135-49), Thomas R. Frosch (79-89), the late Northrop Frye
                                (39-52), Jean H. Hagstrum (67-78), W.J.T. Mitchell (111-34), Alicia
                                Ostriker (90-110), Morton D. Paley (150-63), and Steven Shaviro
                                (164-74). All these names will be familiar to any serious student of
                                Blake, and they stand for a liberal selection of a variety of
                                post-war approaches to the interpretation of Blake’s poetry.
                                But does this alone supply sufficient reason to republish a series
                                of excerpts in book format? Such recycling may be good for the
                                publishers, and it may fill a requirement that arises from the
                                teaching of Blake in the context of a general romanticism course.
                                However, I doubt that this is particularly good promotion for that
                                kind of reading culture that the editor himself has strongly
                                propagated elsewhere. Adams has here contributed both an
                                introduction (1-7) and an afterword on “The World-View of
                                William Blake in Relation to Cultural Policy” (193-204); the
                                latter is—and I feel that there is some irony in
                                this—closely related to his <hi rend="i">Antithetical

              <p>—This article, which presents a brief outline of
                                Blake’s revolutionary writings, is preceded by an equally
                                brief editorial introduction, concerned with the author and his
                                previous contributions to Blake studies. Altizer’s text was
                                translated by Federico Patán for publication in the Dec. 1987

              <p>—The five parts of this account treat of “Natsume
                                Soseki and Blake” (1-3), “The Earliest Appearance of
                                Blake in Japan” (3-5), “Yanagi Soetsu and <hi rend="i">Shirakaba</hi>

                                (17-19). The bibliographical backdrop to this account has recently
                                been described in great detail by Gerald Bentley and Keiko Aoyama
                                (see #17, above). The author, who over the past few years has
                                emerged as a leading authority in Japanese Blake studies, here
                                repeats Jugaku’s warnings against a “comparative study
                                between Blake and Buddhism” as “not always
                                useful” and possibly even “harmful” (18).</p>
              <p>38. Ando, Kiyoshi. “[A Study of William Blake’s

Ronshu</hi> 48 (1991): 119-45.</p>
              <p>—This article, published in Japanese, presents a working
                                diary, kept by the author when studying Blake’s illuminated
                                books at the Department of Prints and Drawings in 1990. He informs
                                his readers about how to gain admission to the Print Room and what
                                to do there (119-20), and then lists Blake’s titles, supplies
                                transcriptions of some earlier ownership inscriptions, occasionally
                                records the provenance, refers to a facsimile reproduction, and
                                quotes the inventory number for the copies now owned by the British
                                Museum. The most detailed of Ando’s own notes on
                                Blake’s texts and designs are concerned with the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>
(121-24), <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (128-36), and <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi> (137-39).
Along with
                                an offprint, the author has also supplied the translation of the
                                title for this article into English that is cited above. See the
                                subsequent entry for a sequel.</p>

              <p>—This article, written and published in Japanese, supplements
                                the author’s textual and editorial studies of Blake’s
                                manuscript epic in London (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 23 [1989-90]:
                                124 [#23]; 25 [1991-92]: 13 [#41], as well as the two subsequent
                                entries). As Ando has pointed out in correspondence, the present
                                publication is primarily concerned with the deletions and
                                corrections in the manuscript for Nights I and II which he studied
                                at the Department of Manuscripts of the British Museum in 1990
                                (65-80). This report is followed by a section of brief notes (in the
                                style of a diary, complete with dates and times of study) on the 
<hi rend="i">Job</hi> designs (81-84), the London examples from the
                                Dante watercolors and engravings (85-86), and a number of
                                Blake’s prints (86-89). As a whole, then, the publication
                                forms the second part to the article listed in the preceding
                                entry.</p>
              <p>40. Ando, Kiyoshi. “The Textual Problems of <hi rend="i">The
                                    Four Zoas</hi> [3]: Pages 5 and 6 of the MSS.” <hi rend="i">Tokai
English Review</hi> 2 (1990): 1-19.</p>
              <p>—The “present paper . . . tries to reconsider pages 5
                                and 6 . . . and it also tries to re-evaluate the existing texts of
                                    <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>” (1). In order to do so,
                                Ando describes the manuscript in some detail and sums up the
                                editorial decisions made by Ellis and Yeats, Sloss and Wallis,
                                Keynes, Margoliouth, in Bentley’s reproduction of the
                                manuscript and in his edition of the <hi rend="i">Writings</hi>, by
                                Erdman in his edition and in the volume of reproductions of the
                                manuscript edited in collaboration with Cettina Tramontano Magno,
                                and by Stevenson. Ando draws on the 1978 articles by Erdman and
                                Lincoln on “Night the First” that were published in
                                    <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, and from the materials thus gathered
                                together, he then attempts to reconstruct Blake’s own process
                                of writing and re-writing <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> into <hi rend="i">The Four
Zoas.</hi> Though, “on the whole, we [i.e.,
                                Ando] arrive at the same conclusion as Lincoln,” the author
                                is right in stressing that this result was reached by following
                                different lines of reasoning (15). He suggests a new critical
                                “edition with facsimiles and transcriptions faithful to
                                Blake’s MSS,” modeled on the Cornell Wordsworth as
                                “the best example,” or Erdman and Moore’s
                                “excellent” edition of Blake’s Notebook
                                (15-16). For parts 1 and 2 of this serialized study of
                                Blake’s manuscript and the author’s earlier
                                comparisons of the “seven editions . . . and the

              <p>—This part of Ando’s study of the various layers of
                                text in Blake’s illustrated manuscript is devoted to pages 7
                                and 143. The author’s minute comparisons of the text from
                                these pages in the various editions of the epic are here charted on
                                three concordance tables (18-31), and new (computer-processed)
                                transcripts of pages 5-7 and 143-44 are included (32-39). For parts

                                boards, $16.95 paper.</p>
              <p>—In Ault’s view “the surface plot of racial
                                difference and theological rationalization [in ‘The Little
                                Black Boy’] obscures both the issue of gender and its
                                relation to the text’s grammatical destabilization.”
                                The poem itself, by “emphasizing the way racial,
                                geographical, and cultural differences are transformed into
                                ontotheological differences,” is said to divert
                                “attention from its most fundamental movement—a
                                turning away from a (bodily, present, ‘real’) mother
                                toward a (utopian, absent, ‘imaginary’)
                                father.” Following the “mother’s speaking voice
                                [as a] medium of exchange between males” (76) through the
                                poem “metonymically, piece by piece” (77), the author
                                constructs and deconstructs various “perspectives”
                                from which the poem, the semantics of its words, and their
                                grammatical interrelations can be read and viewed. This is close
                                reading at its best, systematically unsystematic, and directed
                                against the grain of the “machinery of phallocentric
                                thinking” (86). In a “Postscript” (86-88) Ault
                                reflects on some of the theoretical problems encountered when
                                writing the essay. He ends with a note for which I truly envy him:
                                “In a dream I showed this manuscript to Blake, who told me
                                that he was ‘not uncomfortable’ with my reading of
                                ‘The Little Black Boy.’” This of course is just
                                wonderful, and creative, too. I hardly ever dream of Blake myself,
                                yet I have always assumed that he would probably hate most of what I
                                (like any other scholar, male or female) write about him anyway.</p>

              <p>—Students of comparative literature are not easily discouraged
                                from attempting yet another examination of “Blake and . . .
                                .” The present checklist supplies more and ample evidence for
                                this (see the introduction, above). Bagchee, however, in this essay
                                is careful not to overstrain the case for which, as he admits in the
                                very first sentence, the “bare facts . . .are not numerous,
                                nor are they particularly compelling if we take a simply rational
                                view of the matter.” Therefore, the author is “not
                                proposing too fine a point for William Blake’s
                                ‘influence’ on Eugene O’Neill. Rather, [he is]
                                suggesting merely that some aspects of the playwright’s
                                temperament may have found congenial elements in the life and works
                                of Blake, as he knew them.” Therefore, the purpose of this
                                article “is quite limited: to describe as clearly as possible
                                the <hi rend="i">probable</hi> grounds of imaginative contact and
                                similarity between O’Neill and Blake” (25). Starting
                                from O’Neill’s inscription in the copy of the 1925 <hi rend="i">Writings
of William Blake</hi> that he gave to his
                                future wife, Bagchee examines the evidence for
                                O’Neill’s interest in Blake’s poetry, for the
                                “oriental preoccupations” (36) that are said to have
                                been shared by both authors, as well as for the legend about
                                Blake’s “Irish/O’Neill heritage” (29) as
                                championed by Ellis and Yeats. Instead of merely overstressing the
                                “similar interests or similar poetic goals” in Blake
                                and O’Neill, the author presents a well-tempered account of
                                the “crucial differences between their approaches”
                                (36), too. He has here successfully added another chapter to the
                                story of Blake’s reputation that was begun in Deborah

              <p>—This is the first study to view the entire corpus of
                                Blake’s writings in illuminated printing from the critical
                                platform provided by reader-response criticism. The book thus
                                contributes a new questionnaire as well as new insights to the
                                ongoing attempt to understand that peculiar genre, Blake’s
                                illuminated books. Behrendt here “explores the dynamics of
                                the reading process involved in reading . . . Blake’s
                                illuminated poems. . . . Because reading verbal texts and visual
                                texts involves different aesth[e]tic assumptions and operations, the
                                texts of Blake’s illuminated pages simultaneously make
                                different demands on their readers, which further complicates the
                                reading activity. I have not attempted here to offer a comprehensive
                                reading of Blake’s poetry. Rather, I have explored some of
                                the demands that Blake’s illuminated texts place upon us as
                                part of the process of reading and comprehension. I have tried to
                                outline some of the ways in which the intellectual and imaginative
                                transaction proceeds between author and reader via the medium of the
                                illuminated text as physical artifact” (viii). A sustained
                                argument throughout the book is Behrendt’s concern with the
                                openness of Blake’s visual and verbal texts (Eco’s <hi rend="i">The Open
Work</hi> is cited early on in note 15 to
                                chapter 1). In his readings of the reading processes offered by the
                                pages of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (36-72), <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>
                                (74-84), <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> (84-93), the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>
(93-100), the Continental prophecies (105-24),
                                the Urizen trilogy (126-51), <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (153-65) and
                                    <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (165-73), Behrendt continually
                                retums to the cooperation of author and reader in the creation of
                                “meaning” as his central <hi rend="i">leitmotif.</hi>
                                In these works, he finds that readers “are everywhere forced
                                to assess and to choose . . .as they struggle to ferret out
                                something that they strive individually to determine to be
                                Blake’s ‘meaning’. But ‘meaning’
                                in Blake’s works is ultimately a largely co-authored product,
                                a fabric of signification whose pattern and weave reflects the
                                readers’ views and activities perhaps as much as they do
                                Blake’s” (1). With “meaning” so unstable
                                and individualized, what can be said at all about “the
                                program that propels Blake’s illuminated poetry”? In
                                Behrendt’s view this common denominator will have to be seen
                                as “an exercise in the shaping of a community of prophets, of
                                cooperating artist/viewer/readers” (173). There are 16
                                illustrations, and <hi rend="i">Reading William Blake</hi> merits a
                                reading. Unfortunately, the book’s price puts it outside the
                                reach of the average student; therefore, before a paper-back edition
                                becomes available, its circulation will probably be limited to
                                members of the “inner circle” of Blake scholars. See

              <p>—Taking his cue from Erdman’s biography of John Oswald
                                (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 22 [1988-89]: 55 [#161]), the author
                                speculates that Blake had heard about William Thomson’s
                                “exceedingly peculiar theory,” according to which it
                                really was John Oswald who under the pseudonym of Napoleon
                                Buonaparte left his mark on European history. This then would
                                finally give meaning to a passage in Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of
Blake</hi> (1863) that presumably would otherwise
                                continue to be considered no more than a posthumous anecdote.
                                Crediting an unnamed friend as his authority, Gilchrist reported
                                that Blake “embraced . . . a ‘curious
                                hypothesis’” (293) that does indeed share some
                                similarities with Thomson’s.</p>

                                read on the occasion of the conference on “The Romantics as

                                Association and held at the British School at Rome, 15-17 Apr. 1988.
                                Because Blake never crossed the Channel and thus “is an exile
                                with a difference” (33), Bentley employs a biographical
                                sketch for his framework in order to situate numerous quotations
                                from Blake’s own writings, from those of some of his
                                contemporaries, and from early accounts of Blake’s life. In
                                effect, the article recapitulates the artist-poet’s
                                criticisms of the Roman empire of antiquity and of the modern
                                British empire. Bentley stresses the fact that in Blake’s
                                writings both the positive and the negative connotations of
                                “England,” “Italy,” and
                                “Rome” cannot be understood without looking
                                simultaneously at the social and political history of late
                                eighteenth-century Europe and at the history of art.</p>

              <p>—Starting out from the observation that “Blake has
                                repeatedly been linked to the underground world of secret societies,
                                mesmerism and magic, freemasonry and fraud,” Bentley supplies
                                further evidence “that the artistic world of Blake’s
                                time was rife with speculation about the limits of reason and the
                                powers of the unknown.” In this brief source study of Blake
                                and Cumberland the former is depicted as “one of the most
                                vigorous and independent of these speculators” (294), and it
                                is said to be “at least possible that Blake’s
                                information about this subterranean world and his attitudes towards
                                it” (295) were derived from the latter, even though
                                Cumberland manifestly “was not one of the credulous.”
                                The author stresses “the need to treat such hypothetical
                                connections” between Blake and that
                                “underworld” with “considerable scepticism
                                until we have solid evidence for them” (296). For

                                sure though that Bentley will consider the “evidence”

<hi rend="i">biographical</hi> and <hi rend="i">documentary</hi> evidence)

authors “conclude that
                                Cromek and Stothard were the originators of the conception for a
                                picture of the Procession of Chaucer’s Canterbury
                                Pilgrims” (682), Bentley remains-unconvinced by their
                                arguments. He insists “that both the old evidence and the new
                                [as brought forward by Ward and Read] reveal R. H. Cromek as a man
                                whose promises and words are not [i.e., never] to be trusted . . .
                                Blake was clearly taken in and betrayed by Cromek.” If this
                                holds true in the case of the designs and engravings for
                                Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>, Bentley reasons that it must
                                “probably” be true “in much the same way with
                                respect to the Canterbury Pilgrims design and engraving”
                                (683)—an irrefutable conclusion or no more than an
                                impassioned hypothesis?</p>

Apr.-May 1991: 16-17.</p>
              <p>—The author announces the discovery of previously unrecorded
                                copies of “The Chaining of Orc” and of “The Man
                                Sweeping the Interpreter’s Parlour,” which were found
                                “tucked behind the flyleaf of a copy of Alexander
                                Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi>”
                                (16). A third print from the same source, and attributed to Blake by
                                the auctioneers (and by Robert Essick), is a “metal
                                cut” (17) version (i.e., evidently a relief-etching) of
                                Blake’s wood-engraved illustrations for Virgil’s first
                                    <hi rend="i">Eclogue</hi> (see also #104, below). Since at
                                present there is only one other known impression of “The
                                Chaining of Orc” (in the Rosenwald Collection at the National
                                Gallery in Washington, DC), this print was bound to sell at a record
                                price when auctioned by Sotheby’s in New York on 9-11 May
                                1991. Following this spectacular discovery and sale, owners of the
                                first and second editions of Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life</hi> will
probably want to to reexamine their copies. See

              <p>53. Bidlake, Steven. “Blake, the Sacred, and the French
                                Revolution: 18th-Century Ideology and the Problem of
                                Violence.” <hi rend="i">European Romantic Review</hi> 3
                                (1992-93): 1-20.</p>
              <p>—Bidlake attempts to lift the ideological veil that, by means
                                of “an aesthetification or other screening,” hinders
                                “a full recognition of violence,” and that produces
                                “an evasion of its serious implications.” Because
                                there is a tendency in Blake criticism that “persistently
                                seeks to contain the violence in Blake’s texts so that it may
                                be subordinated to an intrepretive category or strategy capable of
                                rendering it inoffensive,” such criticism has in consequence
                                “closed off access to an important affective and symbolic
                                dimension of [Blake’s] prophetic texts” (1). The
                                article examines the role and discourse of violence in
                                Burke’s <hi rend="i">Reflections</hi> (2-4), then turns to
                                “an approach to violence in culture” (4) as opened up
                                by Freud and Girard, uses this approach to describe “the
                                pattern in which the problem of violence manifests itself in the
                                French Revolution” (6), and applies the findings to a reading
                                of <hi rend="i">The French Revolution, America</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Four
Zoas</hi> (8-16). Bidlake’s aim in
                                writing this essay must have been to inform his readers that
                                “at the very least Blake’s inclusion of stark imagery
                                of violence in what has so often been read as the unqualified
                                triumph of apocalyptic imagination in Night 9 should remind us that
                                the guillotine and allied forms of revolutionary violence are the
                                obverse of the ideal doctrine of fraternity and rational equality, a
                                fact that Paine and Wollstonecraft all too conveniently neglected
                                and Burke too facilely explained away” (15-16). That is fine.
                                And yet what troubled me while reading the article was the
                                author’s reluctance to acknowledge in his methodology and in
                                his readings of Blake that there is (or at the very least may be) a
                                difference between violence as it was enacted in the historical
                                event of the French Revolution and the <hi rend="i">Terreur</hi>,
                                and the <hi rend="i">representation</hi> of such violence in a work
                                of art, between corporeal and spiritual warfare. To Bidlake such a
                                recognition that there is a difference between having a man or woman
                                guillotined, and the depiction of that same act in poetry and art
                                presumably would appear as synonymous with “an
                                aesthetification or other screening” of the “problem
                                of violence.” Yet without taking into account the aesthetic
                                nature of Blake’s productions that was so important to him,
                                how is one to understand the historical effectivity of the
                                guillotine on one side, and the ineffectivity of Blake’s
                                critique of the politics of his times on the other? See also #107

              <p>54. Bigwood, Carol. “Seeing Blake’s Illuminated
                                Texts.” <hi rend="i">Journal of Aesthetics and Art
                                    Criticism</hi> 49 (1991): 307-15.</p>
              <p>—As a philosopher, and with a “concern [that] stems
                                from Merleau-Ponty’s interrogation of cognition and
                                perception,” Carol Bigwood returns to a number of questions
                                that others have asked before. “Like the poet William Blake
                                of the modern age and Heidegger and other postmodern thinkers, this
                                essay views cognition as a restrictive rationality. By investigating
                                the interrelationship of cognition and perception as played out in
                                my reading of some of Blake’s original illuminated texts, I
                                will show how these works frustrate the usual cognitive reading of
                                texts and encourage a fuller perceptual experience. His books,
                                thereby, not only slightly disengage us from the epochal
                                perspective, but alert us to the restrictive character of our
                                thinking, intimating a more flexible thinking that is at once more
                                in-sight-ful [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] and more open to the
                                prelinguistic movements of perception” (308). There is
                                nothing wrong with such a statement. Yet whereas the critical jargon
                                as well as the citation of Merleau-Ponty or Heidegger as authorities
                                on the problem of “cognition and perception” in Blake
                                may belong to Bigwood, the essence of these assertions is not
                                entirely new to Blake studies. If told that Blake “transforms
                                our reading into an unexpectedly sensuous experience and encourages
                                us to rediscover a creative, active pursuit which tries to get
                                beneath ready-made concepts to the existential experience to which
                                these signs originally gave form” (309), or that he
                                encourages “us to <hi rend="i">sensuously</hi> experience the
                                meanings of words” (311), some readers may feel that in 1991
                                this sounds all too familiar. Therefore, it is with some relief that
                                in turning to the notes (which make no attempt to demonstrate any
                                intimate knowledge of previous Blake criticism) one finds the
                                publications of at least one Blake scholar duly credited.
                                “Mitchell’s work on Blake’s ‘composite
                                art’ in many ways anticipates my own phenomenological study
                                of the intercoursing of textual and drawing lines in Blake’s
                                illuminations” (314-15n5). Unfortunately, Bigwood’s
                                own “phenomenological study” is further impaired by
                                what I think is a mistaken and by now outdated idea about the
                                artist’s working procedures (see 315n7), or her lack of
                                familiarity with eighteenth-century conventions for the signing of a
                                copperplate, practices that were common to Blake and many of his
                                fellowengravers and therefore unlikely to carry a personal Blakean
                                meaning (see 315n11). No doubt, in this essay one does encounter a
                                couple of “in-sight-ful” observations on the minute
                                particulars in the movements of Blake’s lines and the
                                correspondences between them. Still, those who are looking for a
                                more sustained examination of what it means to see and read
                                Blake’s illuminated pages are advised to see #45, above.</p>

                                of the symbols in both of the poets, we shall explore in detail
                                their world views, aiming thereby to arrive at a deeper insight into

              <p>—In “response to critics like Jerome McGann,”
                                the author here argues “that the early Romantic pastorals and
                                idyll of Rousseau, Wordsworth, and Blake incorporate history into
                                their forms.” Black distinguishes “early Romantic
                                pastoral by its structure of aggression and dominance, a structure
                                derived from Rousseau,” and she finds that
                                “Blake’s pastorals unmask the dominance at the basis
                                of innocence and expose it as a mystifying form of ideological
                                legitimation and control. Criticizing the tutorial idyll advocated
                                by theorists of education like Rousseau and Mary Wollstonecraft,

              <p>—The author of this dissertation aspires to be different, he
                                wants to surprise his readers, and in order to do so offers some
                                thunder and lightning. The study presents a critique of all rational
                                criticism, even where it is of a post-structuralist brand, and of
                                its proponents who “have rehabilitated ‘Mad
                                Blake,’ elucidating his ‘system’ and
                                identifying his sources. . . . With Blake’s madness now so
                                methodical, this most rebellious, most intractable of poets is in
                                more danger of being institutionalized than ever.” While
                                saying nothing in this abstract about the possible contribution that
                                is being made by yet another dissertation to this very phenomenon,
                                Blumenfeld calls upon the “new science of chaos” (here
                                said to champion “the essential irrationality of complex
                                forms”) and “the method of Gaston Bachelard” in
                                his brave attempt to save Blake’s “anger and
                                irrationality” from the onslaught of rationalist academics.
                                The “theoretical foundation” supplied by
                                Bachelard’s philosophy “of science and
                                imagination” allows for an understanding of “the
                                fractal-like quality of Blake’s poetry.” However, I am
                                not entirely convinced that this understanding is all that new.
                                Being told that “Blake’s imaginative cosmos yields a
                                poetics of space, time, and matter, whose phenomenological
                                description develops out of the dynamism in Blake’s
                                imagery,” that space “in Blake is always created
                                through bodily exertion and pain,” that the
                                “discontinuity and impulse-driven cadences characterizing
                                Blakean time emerge through images of walking, hammering and
                                singing,” and that “Blake’s antagonism to
                                matter is full of ambivalence, since the resistances of metal and
                                stone develop his mental strength and muscular art,” I still
                                felt reminded of some of the findings of three generations of
                                rationalist scholars. And I am afraid that while certainly
                                “Blake, even sane, must . . . retain his anger and
                                irrationality,” scholarship and criticism cannot but engage
                                with it in the “fundamentally rational” manner that
                                Blumenfeld pretends to scorn. He is right, of course, in stating
                                that the “experience of poetry, especially Blake’s, is
                                not wholly rational, and rational explanations of irrationality
                                prove inadequate”—and yet, “inadequate”
                                to what? Occasionally, some earlier critics must have thought about
                                the aims as well as the limits of scholarly explication and
                                interpretation of poetry? A reading of David Fuller’s book of
                                1988 might have demonstrated to Blumenfeld that at least he is not
                                alone in raising such basic questions, not even in the narrow field
                                of Blake studies, and that others already have supplied a program
                                for coping with the issues he is interested in; see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 22

                                (1992): 69-93.</p>
              <p>—Brewster is convinced that “in the radical literature
                                of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the proper
                                individual roles in and social function of marriage were recurrent
                                themes” (69), and that these themes were of great interest to
                                Blake. Therefore, he begins with a historical sketch of the Marriage
                                Act of 1753 and its results for gender relations (70-72) before
                                briefly examining Godwin’s and Wollstonecraft’s
                                arguments “for a new role for women in marriage” (74).
                                The article then turns to the motif and metaphor of marriage in
                                Blake’s writings, carefully and succinctly highlighting the
                                critical potential of its use from a Notebook poem through 
<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (76-87). In summing up, the author
                                points out that in his writings “Blake was more-progressive
                                than Godwin, Byron, Shelley, Owen, and most of the other male
                                writers who took up male-female relations as a major theme. He was
                                also more radical than Wollstonecraft.” And while Blake
                                “did not present satisfying conclusions for the questions he
                                raised about gender relations,” he was still a
                                “progressive thinker and artist in the way that all of the
                                best progressive thinkers and artists are: he took up the materials
                                that were available to him and molded them into works that imaged
                                possibilities of social relations not yet seen on earth or in
                                heaven” (88).</p>
              <p>66. Brewster, Glen E. “‘Out of Nature’: Blake

                                    Atlantic Review</hi> 56.4 (1991): 7-22.</p>
              <p>—Like Jon Mee in his recent book (<corr type="emend">see #173,</corr> below), Brewster is
                                here concerned with the role played by the British Revolution
                                controversy of the 1790s in the shaping of Blake’s works. As
                                an investigation in one of the discursive fields that have not been
                                extensively treated in <hi rend="i">Dangerous Enthusiasm</hi>, the
                                present article serves as a useful if minor addendum to Mee’s
                                studies. The article argues that Blake like “the participants
                                in the Revolution debate reexamined ideas of human nature as a
                                philosophical ground for social and political economies, tried to
                                redefine the English character in terms of the necessity for
                                accommodation and change, and argued passionately about the
                                implications of all these for the future.” Therefore,
                                Brewster proposes to “look at the main tropes of the
                                Revolution debate . . . [as] a means of establishing the
                                contemporary ideas available to Blake for his own specific uses in
                                his poetry of social critique” (8). The essay traces the
                                connotations of “nature” and the rhetorics of
                                religious and revolutionary discourse in Richard Price (8-12),
                                Edmund Burke (11-14), and Thomas Paine (14-16), and only then turns
                                to an examination of Blake’s radical reworking of
                                “these metaphorical materials” in <hi rend="i">The
                                    French Revolution</hi> (17-20). In passing, Brewster also
                                attempts to provide an answer to the question why the poem was left
                                unfinished, an answer here based “on aesthetic rather than
                                circumstantial grounds” (17).</p>

              <p>—Butlin examines the specific form that Blake’s
                                signature took in works of the period 1806-09 in an attempt to date
                                the smaller and the larger set of the watercolors in illustration of
                                    <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> more precisely than has been

possible before. At the same time he asks
                                for the extent of the larger series of illustrations, asking
                                “whether in fact the series does consist of just the twelve
                                subjects or whether one should add two further works” (146).

              <p>—A brief sketch of the effects that some contemporary
                                developments in literary criticism had on the study of
                                Blake’s pictorial art (notably post-structuralism and
                                reader-response criticism) is followed by Chayes’s own use of
                                “the reader-response approach” in an attempt
                                “to open up this relatively neglected area of Blake studies
                                by exploring the responses that might be called out by a series of
                                his pictures” (441). She argues that in the case of the <hi rend="i">Night
Thoughts</hi> watercolors “the viewer is
                                required to be a reader first, but his response to the drawing may
                                take him far from the original text; moreover, after he has
                                experienced the drawing his reader’s understanding of that
                                same text may be drastically altered. . . . Because the literary
                                texts at hand were not his own, Blake evidently felt free to explore
                                the visual possiblities of even minor verbal passages, construct
                                narrative or dramatic situations out of passing suggestions in the
                                text, or contend wordlessly with the philosophical or theological
                                positions taken by his author [i.e., Young]. His own readers [that
                                is, in this case, his viewers] and critics have a similar freedom in
                                dealing with the drawings he produced.” Since this
                                “may provide clues to the more problematic relations of word
                                and image in what has been called Blake’s ‘composite
                                art’” (442), the present article is closely related to
                                the one recorded in the subsequent entry and to a recent study by
                                Michael Tolley (for which see #227, below).</p>
              <p>78. Chayes, Irene H. “Words in Pictures. Testing the Boundary:
                                Inscriptions by William Blake.” <hi rend="i">Word and
                                    Image</hi> 7 (1991): 85-97.</p>
              <p>—Chayes sums up her argument in stating that, although
                                “over the years much has been written about <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and 
<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> especially, almost
                                always the visual and verbal relations both embody have been a
                                concern only when they could be subordinated to his [Blake’s]
                                privileged ‘prophetic’ texts.” Therefore, she
                                has here “tried to show at least what Blake’s words of
                                one particular kind can do when they are subordinated to his
                                pictures” (96). In order to substantiate this argument, Irene
                                Chayes has studied “selections from a special class of
                                Blake’s inscriptions, those that are not merely on or about
                                his pictures but are situated within them” (85). She has
                                looked closely at “Pictures of Writing” in the series
                                of watercolors illustrating Young and Gray, and at the “mock
                                hieroglyphs” (86) in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>, then turned to
                                “Labelling Images” in a second, and to “Mottoes
                                and Mirror Writing” in a third section of her article. Here,
                                most of “the inscriptions considered [are] from . . . 
<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>,” and one learns how “both
                                the verbal inscriptions and the visual images around them may be
                                affected, drawn from one direction or the other to test the boundary
                                that invisibly separates them as distinct modes of art” (85).
                                With the inscriptions that Blake has introduced into some of the
                                designs for <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, in their
“Contrariety and Ambiguity”
                                (90), Chayes finds the poet-artist starting out from somewhere far
                                “on the verbal side,” and then gradually leading
                                towards “the boundary between the visual and the
                                verbal” and sometimes even beyond, where the written
                                inscription is “attracted to the other side, the realm of
                                purely visual images” (87). In a detail from the bottom of
                                    <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 72 the author recognizes “the
                                culmination of the drive to cross the visual-verbal boundary”
                                (96). Words in this instance are said to act “as
                                pictures” in a process of “assimilation” which
                                transcends both of the two distinct modes of art that Blake had
                                started out from. For a related examination of Blake’s
                                purpose in introducing reversed writing into his designs for

              <p>—With the present paper the author addressed an audience made
                                up primarily of fine art librarians on the occasion of the third
                                “Convegno europeo delle Biblioteche d’Arte.”
                                Having referred to earlier definitions of the genre (1-2),
                                Cieszkowski turns to the “history of the development of the
                                exhibition catalogue,” and stresses the generic function of
                                such publications as “a manifesto, a statement of intent or
                                ideology, or a claim to consideration beyond the temporal and local
                                parameters governing the exhibition” itself (2). As proof for
                                this thesis, the author offers a brief historical analysis of the
                                catalogues issued on the occasion of the one-man exhibitions that
                                were held by Nathaniel Hone in 1775 (3-4), by William Blake in 1809
                                (4-6), and by Benjamin Robert Haydon in 1846 (6-7). Interestingly,
                                all three were of course
                                “contra-Reynolds-and-the-Academy” publications, and all
                                three accompanied exhibitions that failed to realize the
                                artists’ hopes for public recognition. While not claiming
                                “that these three examples are either very typical or
                                particularly indicative of the range of exhibitions and their
                                related publications,” Cieszkowski urges his fellow
                                librarians to remember “the hopes and aspirations of
                                individuals” and “the human sensibilities that have
                                engendered something new, original and eloquent, often at a cost we
                                are never asked to pay” (7).</p>

              <p>—The present study of romantic irony in Blake and Kierkegaard
                                is based on the author’s 1987 dissertation, previously listed
                                in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 22 (1988-89): 44 (#52). This may explain
                                why the aim of “the analogy with Kierkegaard”
                                described by the book is “to suggest directions for situating
                                Blake relative to the 
<pb id="p26-91" n="91"/>
critical discourses
                                he has thus far so successfully resisted” (22), i.e., the
                                discourses of “deconstructive and poststructuralist
                                criticism” (1). Whether or not such a statement still holds
                                true in 1991, Clark here concentrates on the late prophecies and
                                argues, in brief, “that in his new focus on the struggle of
                                Los and the Spectre in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas, Milton</hi>, and
                                    <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Blake turns from a Hegelian
                                ‘both-and’ dialectic of Orc and Urizen in his early
                                works to something very like a Kierkegaardian
                                ‘either/or’” (2). An overview of the contents
                                of Clark’s five chapters and her conclusion will be found on

              <p>82. Cohen, Michael. “Addison, Blake, Coram, and the London
                                Foundling Hospital: Rhetoric as Philanthropy and Art.” 
<hi rend="i">Centennial Review</hi> 34 (1990): 540-66.</p>
              <p>—Cohen starts out by drawing attention to
                                “Addison’s nine paragraphs on the subject of charity
                                children” in the <hi rend="i">Guardian</hi>, their putative
                                impact on Blake and their transformation “into the
                                ‘Holy Thursday’ poem for <hi rend="i">Songs of
                                    Innocence</hi>” (541). He then turns to Thomas Coram and
                                the London Foundling Hospital which, soon after its institution in
                                1739, “became an illustration of a new alliance in English
                                cultural life—a sisterhood of Art and Charity” (542)
                                and then developed into “London’s first public gallery
                                and its only public gallery for the first few decades of its
                                existence” (546). The facts about Coram’s friendship
                                with Hogarth and their “partnership . . . in philanthropy and
                                art” (550) are summarized. Cohen also describes the peculiar
                                function which the exhibition of paintings that had been presented
                                to the Foundling Hospital had for the eighteenth- and nineteenth
                                century artists who contributed to the rapidly growing collection.
                                Several of the paintings are then treated in some detail, with
                                special emphasis on the works by Emma Brownlow King (551-64). Thus,
                                the article certainly makes a welcome illustrated introduction to an
                                important collection of British paintings that has been described in
                                detail by the late Benedict Nicolson as the
                                “treasures” of the Foundling Hospital. It offers,
                                however, precious little information that might justify the
                                inclusion of Blake’s name in its title.</p>

              <p>—As is explained in the headnote to this joint article (201),
                                Colaiacomo contributed the section on Blake’s ideology of the
                                outline, entitled “Pensieri sull’Outline,”
                                while D’Ottavi is responsible for the examination of the
                                paradox of knowledge in the myth of Urizen, “Il paradosso
                                della conoscenza nel mito di Urizen” (177-203). The latter
                                concentrates as a matter of course on the theme of the collapse of
                                rationalism and language in <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>,
                                and the former presents an account of Blake’s theory of
                                outline in philosophical perspective.</p>

              <p>—“Bring out number weight &amp; measure in a year of
                                dearth.” Cox notes that this proverb “echoes the
                                closing couplet of Andrew Marvell’s poem ‘On Mr
                                Milton’s “Paradise Lost’”: ‘Thy
                                verse created like thy theme sublime,/In number, weight, and
                                measure, needs not rhyme.’” He then compares it with a
                                verse in the apocryphal <hi rend="i">Wisdom of Solomon</hi> and
                                suggests that on account of the indirect allusion to <hi rend="i">Paradise
Lost</hi>, “the proverb can be seen to possess
                                a more positive, if still ambivalent, message” (293) than is
                                usually attributed to it. This argument is to be buttressed in a
                                sequel to the present article which will probably be published in

              <p>—This was the very last entry to be added to the present
                                checklist, and I cannot supply more than a few hints about the
                                impressive scope of this new monograph. “The subject of this
                                book is William Blake’s simultaneous evolution of a theory of
                                love and a practice of logic.” In an examination of all of
                                the poet’s “prophetic” writings, Cox argues
                                that Blake’s vision, “including his vision of love, is
                                inseparable from his logic. Logic is vision’s brain and
                                bone—and its heart, too” (1). Taking his cue from an
                                article by Peter Thorslev published in 1971 (see vii), and
                                effectively criticizing earlier “expositors of Blake”
                                (1), the author demonstrates the close relationship between the
                                concepts of love and logic in more than Blake’s philosophical
                                and aesthetic ideas (see, e.g., 21-25 or 175-81). Rather, he offers
                                extensive interpretations of the “Visionary Logic”
                                that he finds at work in the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (69-90) and
                                    <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> (113-25), in <hi rend="i">America</hi>
                                and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (127-43), in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>
                                (145-65) and in the three shorter of the Lambeth Books (158-64). Cox
                                then turns to “The Ruins of <hi rend="i">The
                                Zoas</hi>,” and to the theme of “Love among the[se]
                                Ruins” (167-203), before examining <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>
                                and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> in detail (205-73). Presenting the
                                mirror-image of the introductory chapter, and by rehabilitating
                                Henry Crabb Robinson as someone who “had precisely the
                                qualifications one could wish for in a reporter of Blake’s
                                words” (275), the book’s concluding chapter describes
                                Blake as “The Logical Visionary” (275-80), one in whom
                                “the love of God” was “a love that uses logic
                                to explore the many and complicated ways of vision’s approach
                                to Him” (280).</p>

                                an imaginative change in their readers.” And it is to this
                                effect, according to Crafton, that “Blake evokes suspension
                                between companion poems of Innocence/Experience, poems of dialogue
                                within Experience, and rhetorically dialogic forces at work within

                                demonstration that Blake and Wordsworth, like other poets before and
                                since, have “carefully shaped . . . the affective
                                structures” inherent in their writings. See also #44, above,

                                “generally similar actions is clear.” And if Blake
                                “were to give ‘a wry look’ at a Thomson poem,
                                it might seem most naturally directed at the often moralistic,

                                first points out numerous similarities in the plot of both works, in
                                their setting, in the “central symbol of the crystal
                                device” (53), and in the characters depicted by both poets,
                                concluding that “Thomson’s poem takes the form

                                closely parallel poem takes the form
                                ‘happy-innocent-to-fallen.’” Crisman, however,
                                remains well aware of the problems encountered “with such a
                                comparison.” “Clichés are at hand: Blake has
                                ironically reversed Thomson’s story, read it
                                ‘demonically,’ ‘subverted’ it; the early
                                Romantic has ‘re-read’ the earlier eighteenth-century
                                allegory.” It is important then to stress that the author
                                succeeds in demonstrating that what “has happened in fact is
                                much more interesting” than that. “Blake has not so
                                much ironically re-read Thomson as he has drawn out traits already
                                latent in Thomson’s narrative” (55). From
                                Crisman’s own re-reading of Thomson’s <hi rend="i">Indolence</hi>, it
becomes clear that the “narrative
                                form of the trapped innocent who becomes the grasper, the rape
                                victim who allies with a rapist is already present in
                                Thomson.” Therefore, all Blake had to do in his
                                “reworking” was “to draw out Thomson’s
                                self-ironic form from its moralistic tendencies and present it
                                pure,” thus “perfecting an

              <p>—This new collection of essays originated in a
                                “conference on Romanticism and the Imagination, held at the
                                University of Melbourne in 1989” (vii). Quite obviously, the
                                organizers and editors assign to “Blake’s
                                non-Coleridgean art” (xi) a major role where it comes to an
                                understanding of the British romantic imagination. No less than
                                three out of the 14 contributions are explicitly concerned with
                                Blake’s works (see also #175 and 227, below). Davies’s
                                well-illustrated article (see figs. 1-14) is in marked contrast with
                                Tolley’s contribution to the same anthology. He attempts to
                                demonstrate “that the interplay between figures, gestures and
                                motifs in these designs [for Milton’s <hi rend="i">Paradise
                                    Lost</hi>] is more intricately orchestrated into a sequential
                                narrative than has been recognized, and that this narrative presents
                                not Milton’s but Blake’s own devil’s party
                                version of the Fall.” Davies criticizes previous
                                interpretations of the two series of watercolor designs which are
                                here said to “have tended to encourage a
                                ‘vertical’ movement of our imagination between poem
                                and designs, while often missing iconographic continuities and
                                contrasts which, when the designs are read
                                ‘horizontally’ as internally coherent sequences, can
                                reveal quite different emphases” (143). The author’s
                                forthcoming book on <hi rend="i">Blake’s Milton Designs: The
                                    Dynamics of Meaning</hi> (to be published in Dec. 1992 as
                                “Locust Hill Literary Studies 7”) is probably based on
                                the same assumptions and is to contain a longer version of the
                                present paper. For related studies of Blake’s series of
                                Milton watercolors see #69, above, and 156, below. In <hi rend="i">Imagining
Romanticism</hi>, Blake is also discussed by John
                                Beer in a paper asking “Is the Romantic Imagination Our
                                Imagination?” (25-48, see 27-29 and passim). Nelson Hilton
                                contributes an essay on “Keats, Teats, and the Fane of
                                Poesy” (49-72) to this collection, which figures as a welcome

              <p>—To an art historian such as Anthony Blunt there could be no
                                question that “in order to understand Blake’s position
                                something must be said about [the sublime and] its use in connection
                                with the visual arts” (<hi rend="i">The Art of William
                                    Blake</hi> [New York, NY: Columbia UP, 1959] 13). This
                                postulate, however, has with some exceptions, scarcely affected the
                                literary criticism of Blake’s writings. Now, De Luca finally
                                stresses that despite “the poet’s stated hostility to
                                Edmund Burke . . . Blake’s involvement with sublimity is . .
                                . something engaging his deeper aesthetic and intellectual
                                concerns.” His book therefore “aims to demonstrate
                                that Blake’s relation to the sublime is not superficial but
                                profound; it argues that traditions of the sublime extant in his
                                time play a major influential role in his aesthetics, the style and
                                organization of his chief poetical works, and indeed, his outlook on
                                the world” (3). But it is the treatment of those
                                “larger questions” that the exploration of
                                Blake’s response to the theory of the sublime leads to, which
                                makes <hi rend="i">Words of Eternity</hi> a most important and
                                hopefully influential study: “how, for example, does the
                                concept of sublimity help to explain and justify the difficulties
                                that Blake’s writings continue to pose? How might it prove an
                                intelligibly unified frame of reference for certain features of the
                                writings that are usually considered separately—for example,
                                odd strategies of style and narrative construction, special patterns
                                of imagery and symbolism, or insistent displays of arcane learning?
                                What, finally, can Blake’s understanding and use of the
                                sublime tell us of his place in the larger discourse of
                                eighteenth-century and Romantic aesthetics?” (3-4). De Luca
                                argues that “sublimity never manifests itself in
                                Blake’s writings as an amorphous body of vague concepts and
                                conventional terms, but rather resolves itself into two strongly
                                delineated and differentiated sublimes.” It is the
                                “interplay of these two modes of sublimity” that
                                constitutes the “running motif of this book”; it links
                                “the subjects of the work’s three main
                                divisions,” and it supplies author and reader with
                                “three related perspectives: theoretical, stylistic, and
                                thematic. The first section of the book, ‘Theory’ [see
                                chapter 1, 15-52], introduces some key terms of Blake’s
                                diction, and then deals specifically with his explicit opinions on
                                the sublime.” It locates the poet’s original
                                contribution to the concept by “developing a sublime of
                                determinate signifiers in which the text itself functions as the
                                sublime object.” The following section, “Style:
                                Sublime Effects” (see chapters 2-4, 55-142), “turns to
                                Blake’s poetry itself and shows how the interplay of the two
                                sublime modes reconstitutes itself on the stylistic level, giving
                                rise to what I call a ‘bardic’ style and an
                                ‘ironic’ style.” Here De Luca exemplifies how
                                the latter of the two “tends . . . to arrest narrative and to
                                collapse temporality into a hard-edged ‘now’ of
                                intellectual intensity.” In the third part of the book,
                                “Worldview: Imagery of Sublime Settings” (see chapters
                                5-7, 145-224), “the juncture of Blake’s specific
                                stylistic gestures, such as his choice of imagery, with his larger
                                thematic interests” (6) is examined, and it is suggested
                                that, if “seen as displacements of thinking in the sublime
                                mode,” “an imaginative unity” (7) can be
                                perceived in “certain strands of thought that attracted
                                Blake’s interest and are reflected in his poetic
                                settings—such as eighteenth-century natural philosophy, the
                                speculations of mythographers . . ., and various kinds of hermetic
                                or quasi-Kabbalistic traditions promoting a hieroglyphic conception
                                of reality” (6-7). Such an agenda may “suggest that
                                this study is . . . an old-fashioned survey of sources and analogues
                                or an intellectually neutral foray into the history of
                                ideas.” And yet, in the writing of this book the author was
                                well aware that he was employed on “a critical
                                reconstruction,” “that the sublime ideology is a
                                historically situated phenomenon like any other and that, as a
                                rampantly idealizing mode, it has rendered itself a particularly
                                inviting target of critique by various demystifying systems of
                                present-day analysis. In what is, however, the first extensive study
                                of Blake’s connections with the sublime tradition . . . a
                                more conservative approach seems to me advisable—one in which
                                the parties to be introduced to one another are presented in terms
                                at least recognizable to themselves” (9). At the end of the
                                book and the beginning of its epilogue (225-31), De Luca finds
                                himself and his readers “on the verge of paradox . . . there
                                is, first, a privileging of the constructed artifact over biological
                                vitality in what is claimed to be the genuine human center of the
                                poet’s vision, and second, more than a touch of solipsism in
                                the claimed universality of that vision.” While he has no
                                hope for resolving these paradoxes, “since Blake never
                                resolved them himself,” they help the author to address two
                                questions; the first of these asks for the place of
                                “Blake’s sublime poetics, its premises and
                                applications . . . in the larger framework of the eighteenth-century
                                and Romantic sublime,” the second, “even less likely
                                to admit a definitive answer, yet not to be avoided,”
                                substitutes critical for historical interests and asks “what,
                                after all, is such a sublime poetics good for?”
                                (225)—not a bad question to mark the end of what seems to me
                                to be a most rewarding book. Moreover, it proves to be a
                                particularly fascinating experience to study De Luca’s
                                reconstruction of the discursive field of the <hi rend="i">Poetics

                                633-55.</p>
              <p>—Den Otter examines “Thel’s Motto” in
                                detail, and the article begins with the observation that the four
                                lines are “not really a motto” at all (633), and that
                                the “very questioning nature of ‘Thel’s
                                Motto’ undermines the motto structure” (634). Rather
                                than “one aphorism of truth,” this motto is yielding
                                “many variant possibilities.” Therefore, “this
                                verse of questions” is here said to act as “an agent
                                of liberating revolution, opening and threatening to expand the
                                seemingly contained dimensions of future promise. Precisely 
<hi rend="i">because</hi> of its interrogation marks, the motto
                                allows Thel her mark of exclamation (her shriek), breaking the
                                ‘proper’ code of conduct with a rash supplement of new
                                energy” (655). Den Otter repeatedly asks: “Are
                                Thel’s questions . . . really so obnoxious that they deserve
                                to be rebuffed?” (640). The answers in turn serve to question
                                the earlier critical consensus concerning the
                                “failure” of the heroine, so that a more positive view
                                of Thel’s role emerges from the article. This revision is
                                soon to be supplemented by Helen Bruder’s study of the same
                                poem. For an earlier and related “Barthesian” <pb id="p26-93" n="93"/>

              <p>—Running to 400-odd pages, this may well be no more than a
                                large book with a pretty small idea. If it is true, as was the
                                conviction of Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, that “no one fails to
                                recognize a Blake,” then it oughtto be possible to describe
                                the functioning of those forms and visual formulas which determine
                                the unity of the artist’s personal style. Therefore, the
                                present study scarcely ever addresses for their own sake those
                                questions that are concerned with the “meaning” or
                                content of a given motif or a design. Rather, it asks for <hi rend="i">the
iconography of style and forms</hi>, for
                                Blake’s strategies in the choice of his materials and working
                                processes, for the common denominator in his compositional treatment
                                of the picture plane, his outline and shading techniques, his
                                coloring, and so on. “Truth has bounds,” Blake once
                                said. “Error none.” This book aspires to establish not
                                “Truth,” but those “bounds” that frame
                                the expressive use of visual language in Blake. In order to
                                distinguish his personal style from period style, its
                                “original,” innovative and characteristic components
                                from the visual conventions and idioms that similarly permeate the
                                works of his contemporaries, the elements of his pictorial
                                vocabulary and syntax are gauged in near-tedious comparisons with
                                the handling of compositional devices by artists such as Romney and
                                West, Mortimer and Barry, Fuseli, Kauffmann and Flaxman, and many
                                more. The book argues that these close comparisons are called for as
                                a means to define the elements that constitute Blake’s
                                personal and easily recognizable style. And it claims that only with
                                such a demarcation between personal and period style firmly
                                established, a critical examination of Blake’s visual
                                vocabulary and grammar can hope to discover more about the
                                individual meaning attached by the artist to the forms, motifs, and
                                often traditional iconography he employed. It is for others, not for
                                the present writer (who happens to be the author of the book), to
                                decide whether such a consciously old-fashioned and/or neo-formalist
                                attempt to supply some basic research for an improved understanding
                                of Blake’s productions as a visual artist was worth the
                                effort. There is no proper index, but a very detailed list of
                                contents (vii-xii) and a catalogue of the works discussed (397-409).

              <p>—The present essay originated in a paper read to the audience
                                of an international conference that was held in Rome in June 1989.
                                It briefly describes Frye’s discovery of “un mondo di
                                archetipi” in Blake (218), the consequences of that discovery

Quarterly</hi> 27 (1991): 174-83.</p>
              <p>—Blake admires the “capacity for inspiration” in
                                the works “of the ancient Greeks,” though “he
                                rebukes them for perverting that divine quality in the service of
                                war or tyranny, whether political or mental.” In this
                                context, Downes asks whether there is “any one work which he
                                [Blake] grants, <hi rend="i">or would grant</hi>, more wholehearted
                                praise” (174; my emphasis). And she sums up her answer to
                                this question by reference to “the last play of
                                Sophocles,” which is said to resemble strikingly “the
                                thought and spirit of William Blake’s poetry, particularly
                                his later prophecies. The <hi rend="i">Oedipus at Colonus</hi> is

                                those concerning the metaphysics of love and blessing, help clarify
                                the essence of each author’s intent and genius in light of

              <p>—This essay is as much concerned with problems of comparative
                                method as it is with the works that are mentioned in its subtitle.
                                Like Wellek or Mason among earlier critics, Engel is not only
                                interested in possible similarities between English and German
                                romanticism, but wants to preserve their contrasts as well. With the
                                “Neue Mythologie” he employs a concept that has been
                                of major importance to recent studies of German romanticism
                                (226-27), and he proposes that such an interest in the creation of a
                                new mythology might usefully operate as one of the criteria which
                                allow for the historical definition of European romanticism in
                                general. The comparison of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>
                                with Novalis’s “Klingsohr” tale (from <hi rend="i">Heinrich von
Ofterdingen</hi>, 1802) tests the validity
                                of such a working hypothesis (227). Rather than suggesting any
                                “direct” influence of one of the two writers on the
                                other, the article attempts to tap some of the ideological currents
                                that proved to be fertile for both Novalis and Blake. Therefore, the
                                first part of Engel’s study presents an introduction to
                                eighteenth-century mythography and its impact on romantic poetry
                                (228-31; see also #173, below); this is followed by two
                                “interpretative sketches” (231) of Blake’s
                                illuminated book (231-33) and Novalis’s tale (233-35). Next,
                                Engel charts the epistemological concerns, the ideas pertaining to
                                “ancient mythology,” and the critique of the mimetical
                                function of art and poetry that were shared by both authors
                                (235-40). The concluding section of the paper (240-45) describes the
                                “Klingsohr” tale and the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> as
                                crucial examples for the process of romantic mythmaking. Blake and
                                Novalis have been variously yoked together in the past, most
                                recently in books by Scholz and Hanke (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>
                                13 [1979-80]: 97; 17 [1983-84]: 66 [#79]). Engel makes no reference
                                to these comparative studies and, with the “new
                                mythology,” wisely addresses a <hi rend="i">tertium
                                    comparationis</hi> as a mediator between the works he discusses.
                                The strengths of Engel’s treatment may well have to do with
                                his awareness of the fact that any “direct comparison between
                                William Blake’s <hi rend="i">Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>
                                and the Klingsohr tale from Novalis’s <hi rend="i">Ofterdingen</hi> 
                                would yield more <corr type="emend">disparities</corr> than
                                similarities; the divergencies in genre, poetics, and the system of
                                ideological preconditions are more than evident” (231; my

              <p>—As stated on the verso of the book’s title page, and
                                except for the shortened title, this is “an unabridged
                                republication of the third [revised] edition (1977).” With
                                this new printing by a new publisher a truly ground-breaking study
                                and a truly standard work of the literature on Blake returns to the
                                classroom. Since Erdman’s historical investigation definitely
                                belongs with that handful of books on Blake that do not seem to age
                                at all, and that remain a constant source of inspiration as much as
                                of information on the poet’s life and work, the new printing
                                is welcome indeed. Erdman’s “historical
                                approach” and the “new” historicism in the
                                interpretation of English romantic literature are not to be
                                confused, but they are also anything but incompatible (see the
                                introduction to #173, below). Therefore, this new printing may well

                                be strongly recommended to any serious student of Blake. The price
                                of the reprint may at first seem a little high if it is compared
                                with the $3.95 that one was asked to pay for a paperback copy of the
                                second edition from Anchor Books (1969), or the $5.95 one paid for
                                the Princeton UP paper-back of the third edition (1977). And yet one
                                only needs to look at some of the other prices cited in the present
                                checklist to feel that the Dover republication of the classic
                                account of Blake’s “Interpretation of the History of
                                His Own Times” (the earlier subtitle of the book) is still
                                the best value for money that one can hope for these days. Dover

                                public lecture which on 4 Apr. 1991 was presented by the

                                California, Riverside. Although Essick here returns “to some
                                work on the English poet-artist William Blake and historical
                                linguistics” that he did “a few years ago,” his
                                “excursion into four of Blake’s paintings and what
                                they tell us about language” is here brought to bear upon
                                more general issues “of specialized research in the
                                humanities.” Therefore, part of the paper is a revised
                                summary of the introductory chapter to the author’s book on
                                    <hi rend="i">William Blake and the Language of Adam</hi>, while
                                its final section is made up of “some reflections on how such
                                [specialized] work relates to larger matters of current concern to
                                us all” (1). In summing up the methodological implications of
                                his own procedure in the interpretation of “Adam Naming the
                                Beasts,” the portrait of Blake from his own collection,
                                Blake’s frontispiece to <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of
                                    Ballads</hi> (1802), “Eve Naming (or, Listening to) the
                                Birds,” “The Virgin and Child in Egypt,” and
                                “Christ Blessing,” Essick emphasizes his belief
                                “that specialized research in the humanities can contribute,
                                through publication and teaching, to the development of two valuable
                                and inter-related ways of thinking that help the self realize,
                                perhaps even escape from, some of its own limitations.
                                Methodological consciousness gives us the ability to multiply the
                                perspectival foundations of the self and become aware of our own
                                mental operations. Such self-reflexivity is a form of self
                                alienation . . . ., but such activities are in themselves part of
                                what makes us human and lie at the heart of research in the
                                humanities” (14).</p>

              <p>—This is a provocative contribution to the historically
                                oriented criticism of Blake’s writings. Its “purpose .
                                . . is to investigate how . . . four issues—politics,
                                science, the Bible, and linguistics—collide and intermingle
                                in Blake’s work during the revolutionary decade of the
                                1790s” (189). Essick reexamines these issues in <hi rend="i">The Marriage of
Heaven and Hell</hi> and <hi rend="i">The
                                    [First] Book of Urizen</hi> where, and this may alarm partisans
                                of the new historicism, he finds “a critique of liberal
                                ideology broader and deeper than Burke’s <hi rend="i">Reflections</hi>”
(199). Essick re-contextualizes
                                Blake’s portrayal of Urizen “back into the ideological
                                debates of the 1790s in which the philosophy of mind and nature had
                                been fully politicized” (200) and stresses the poet’s
                                ironical and critical treatment of doctrines that were central to
                                the writings of the liberal members of the Johnson circle such as
                                Paine, Godwin, and Wollstonecraft. Contrary to received opinion,
                                Blake here emerges not so much as an artist-member of that circle,
                                but as its “prophetic” critic. A wealth of historical
                                material—for example, an examination of “the
                                contemporary political dimensions of applied mathematics”
                                (204) as illustrated in the political career and writings of
                                Condorcet—is here employed to lend weight to the
                                author’s provocative revision of some of “the more
                                resilient commonplaces of modern Blake scholarship” (200).

                                    <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> will necessarily have to take into
                                account the arguments presented in this article and will have to
                                come to grips with a revised view of Blake’s position that
                                emerges here: “Blake tried to reclaim for his own time that
                                combination of radical politics and apocalyptic Christianity which
                                had motivated England’s revolutionaries of the previous
                                century. But in the 1790s, this proved an inherently unstable
                                compound. The Johnson circle was at once too secular in its
                                liberalism and not radical enough in its revolutionism to satisfy
                                Blake” (211-12). This article ought to be studied side by
                                side with Mee’s <hi rend="i">Dangerous Enthusiasm</hi> (#173,

Literature 1500-1900</hi> 31 (1991):
                                615-30.</p>
              <p>—“In this essay,” Essick’s focus is
                                “on Blake’s relationships with women friends and
                                rivals, including the engraver Caroline Watson.” He starts
                                with “the critical history of gender-related themes in
                                Blake’s art” before turning to an examination of
                                “how Blake’s interactions with [such female friends
                                and rivals] influenced his poetic representation of women”
                                (615). The issue of patriarchal sexism is reviewed in readings of
                                the <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> before the
                                author considers “some of the women Blake knew” in
                                order to “illuminate the complex interconnections between his
                                life and art” (617). Catherine Blake is seen as associated
                                with her husband’s idea of “pity” (618), and
                                her “role within Blake’s professional activities as an
                                artist and printmaker” as the “clean hand” for
                                managing the paper and as a colorist is examined. Essick observes,
                                most interestingly I think, that this “division of labor
                                parallels, and may even have helped motivate, Blake’s general
                                aesthetic theories on the superiority of line over color. . . . The
                                language Blake deploys to express the subordination of color to line
                                sometimes implies the same gender divisions determining artistic
                                activities in the Blake household” (619). Next, the article
                                briefly refers to some of the “intertextual relations”
                                of the works of Blake and Wollstonecraft (620), and then follows
                                this up with an examination of the poet-artist’s
                                relationships with Elizabeth Butts (620-22) and with his female
                                rival, the engraver Caroline Watson (622-25). In the competition
                                with Watson for the favor of his patron, “Blake had to
                                feminize his own graphic techniques. To be replaced by a woman in
                                his role as Hayley’s principal engraver, and then to write a
                                letter to Hayley submissively accepting this
                                ‘exchange,’ could only have increased Blake’s
                                anxieties about his own masculinity. Such a compound of feminization
                                and rejection frequently expresses itself through an attack on women
                                as a jealous or threatening enemy and an attempt to negate the
                                feminine aspects of the self. This syndrome can account for the
                                characterization of females and their sexuality in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>
and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>” (626). If
                                any further proof is called for, then this article shows that at
                                present no other scholar is better qualified than Essick to fuse his
                                intimate knowledge of Blake’s writings, his art, the cultural
                                (gender-related, social, political, philosophical, etc.) history of
                                his times, and his grasp on every aspect of Blake’s biography
                                in the writing of the “standard life” that, most
                                recently, James King has sadly failed to produce (see #147,

              <p>—“Blake’s <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> uses
                                elements of quest romance and dream vision to represent the human
                                mind as the dream of an undifferentiated Consciousness. The
                                poem’s teleology mirrors its central paradox that vision, a
                                state outside of time, is the goal toward which history
                                moves.” Following an account of “the problem of
                                causality” in Blake’s epic, a retrograde reading of
                                    <hi rend="i">Vala, or The Four Zoas</hi> furnishes
                                Freeman’s study with, amongst others, these results:
                                “Seen from the perspective of Night the Ninth whose
                                revelations form a complex interplay with moments in the preceding
                                Nights, the fallen state is regarded through gestures and patterns
                                of behavior rather than [as?] an act in which a prior state of
                                innocence is lost. The relation between the narrator, the
                                story-tellers, and the authorial voice is explored retrospectively
                                through the collective epiphany of Night the Ninth. Next, fictions
                                of the Fall and prophecies of the apocalypse as told by various
                                characters are contrasted to the series of revelations in Night the
                                Ninth.” The author then examines “the interplay
                                between the vortex that describes the fallen state as chaotic
                                movement leading to a fearful empty center, and the redeemed version
                                of centricity in which the chaos of the poem’s fallen state
                                leads to the unbinding of the dualistic mind,” finding
                                “the pivotal moment of the interplay” in the two
                                versions of Night the Seventh. For other recently published critical

              <p>—Furman investigates the apocalyptic imagery of three Miltonic
                                illustrations. An introductory sketch of the history of puritan
                                “apocalypticism of Milton’s time” (20) and of
                                the symbolical “system of
                                ‘synchronisms’” in Milton’s poetry (22)
                                is followed by a brief explication of Michael’s Revelation in
                                    <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> (22-24). The author then
                                examines the pictorial treatment of this “apocalyptic
                                frame” (25) in three illustrations to Milton’s
                                expulsion scene (25-31 and figs. 1-3): the Boston version of
                                Blake’s watercolor designs for <hi rend="i">Paradise
                                    Lost</hi>, Carlotta Petrina’s illustration for the 1936
                                Limited Editions Club printing of the same poem, and Mary
                                Groom’s white-line design for the <hi rend="i">Paradise
                                    Lost</hi> edition published in 1937 by the Golden Cockerel
                                Press. Though iconographically it may be true that Petrina
                                “takes a stance as prophetic as Blake’s” (29),
                                it is difficult to discover any visual qualities that the three
                                works have in common. The author has been engaged in
                                “collaborative work on illustrations on Milton” with
                                Virginia Tufte for several years (33n29); the present paper,
                                therefore, may be said to offer a follow-up to those by Tufte that
                                have been listed in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 23 (1989-90): 141
                                (#162), and 25 (1991-92): 32 (#190), and parts of it will probably

              <p>—Having become “interested in the strange history of
                                reception which Blake inherits and to which he contributes,”
                                Glausser proposes “to evaluate and make use of the simulacra
                                as a resource for the interpretation of Blake, and at the same time
                                examine relevant tangles in the Enlightenment reception of
                                atomism” (74). To do so, he starts by introducing his readers
                                to the meanings attached to the word <hi rend="i">simulacra</hi> by
                                Lucretius, Baudrillard, Cook, and Serres (73-74), finding that the
                                “atomistic simulacra . . . receive ambiguous treatment in
                                postmodernism . . . . But this is nothing new” (74). Glausser
                                next turns to questions prompted by Stevenson, Paley, and Hilton,
                                asking how “strong are the connections between
                                [Blake’s use of the word] ‘spectre’ and
                                atomism, between ‘emanation’ and atomism” as
                                familiar from Epicurean natural philosophy (75). In summing up the
                                answers, he states that “it would appear that
                                ‘spectres’ was a common enough translation for
                                simulacra for Blake to have known of this connection” (79),
                                and that simulacra “appears to have been a common enough
                                translation” for Blake’s “emanations”
                                which he may well “have encountered” (80). Glausser
                                continues with an attempt to demonstrate that by “various
                                means . . . —by metaphor and by rationalist theology, by
                                metaphysics and by physics—atomism and Neoplatonism became
                                comfortably compatible” in eighteenth-century enlightenment
                                discourses. “This was not good news for Blake” (82).
                                To counter the bad news, and as part of his
                                “post-Enlightenment” (74), the poet is said to have
                                developed a “kind of spectral ambiguity [that] leads to
                                various effects of confusion in Blake’s long poems”
                                (85). However, “Blake’s spectres, for all their
                                overdetermined complexity, have at least one family resemblance:
                                they collect around themes of separation from an original unity or
                                presence, now lost but still imaginable. In this sense, both atomism
                                and Neoplatonism participate in the spectral. . . . This approach
                                might usefully be carried forward from Blake’s
                                post-Enlightenment to the various postmoderns who have announced,
                                both in denunciation and in celebration, new visions of the
                                spectral” (86).</p>

                                (1990-91): 40-51.</p>
              <p>—Unlike most (yet not all) earlier commentators, Greco
                                believes that “there is much in the text and design of
                                ‘Night’ that would have us question the
                                speaker’s ‘innocent vision’” (41). In
                                both text and the two designs (illus. on 46-47) she detects hints at
                                “the speaker’s spiritual loss in the very process of
                                his Christian ‘redemption’” (44).
                                Blake’s “Night,” instead of being read
                                “as a proclamation of the essential harmony, if not expressly
                                Christian character, of Blake’s ‘state’ of
                                Innocence” (40), is here described as voicing considerably
                                “darker chords.” As Greco’s essay suggests, the
                                narrator of the poem “has fallen into a deadly dream of the
                                mother, sensual passivity, and religious abstraction.” If so,
                                then indeed the “dangers of ‘Night’ would
                                indicate not only ambiguity in <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> but the
                                incipient formation of Blake’s later theme . . . that emerged

                                Blake’ might be found in the fictional character
                                ‘W—m B—e, a great original,’ in the 1824
                                novel <hi rend="i">Confessions of a Justified Sinner</hi> by James
                                Hogg.” Groves has discovered new evidence that “will
                                now indicate that Hogg would have known of Blake from the year 1808,
                                secondly that Hogg consulted an Edinburgh enthusiast for Blake for
                                help in completing one important final detail of his 
<hi rend="i">Confessions</hi>, and thirdly that the novel does indeed refer
                                indirectly to William Blake, and especially to Blake’s
                                designs for Robert Blair’s poem <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>,
                                through the figure of W—m B—e,” a figure whose
                                “association with the grave is the key to unlocking much of
                                the novel’s irony” (27). Groves shows that Hogg knew
                                of Cromek, and that he very likely saw Cromek’s 1808 edition
                                of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> with Schiavonetti’s prints
                                after Blake (28-29). Furthermore, Hogg was acquainted with Allan
                                Cunningham through whom he “probably also learned of
                                Blake” (29). More important for the author’s argument
                                is Hogg’s meeting with Robert Scott (1771-1841), engraver,
                                early Blake aficionado, and the father of William Bell Scott
                                (29-32). It is, in any case, important enough to make Groves agree
                                with the Scotts and with the normative aesthetics of the early
                                nineteenth-century on “the superiority of [Blake’s]
                                designs for <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> over his earlier work for
                                the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>” (30). I am not sure
                                that Blake, had he known of this, would have been all that proud of
                                the esteem in which Schiavonetti’s etchings, rather than his
                                own line engravings, were (and obviously still are) held north of
                                the Scottish border. But just the same, Groves has a strong case in
                                pointing out that in the <hi rend="i">Confessions</hi>
                                “W—m B—e’s role 
<pb id="p26-96" n="96"/>
                                in leading to the grave is suggestively reminiscent of William
                                Blake’s role in illustrating <hi rend="i">The Grave.</hi> . .
                                . Hogg . . .identifies the old shepherd in his novel as
                                ‘W—m B—e, a great original,’ in order to
                                underscore the connection with Blake and his well-known design for
                                    <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>” (32), i.e.,
                                Schiavonetti’s version of “Death’s Door”
                                (fig. 1). The remainder of the article (33-40) is devoted to an
                                interpretation of the role played by “W—m
                                B—e” in Hogg’s narrative.</p>

              <p>—The present study of “probably the most remarkable
                                woman Blake ever conceived [who] is also one of the most
                                complicated, disturbing, and least readily assimilable figures to
                                appear in his poetry” (3), focuses on the discourse of
                                Oothoon herself. The author demonstrates how
                                “Oothoon’s language destabilizes sexual and semantic
                                possession at the same time,” and thus puts into question
                                “the possessiveness of fixed referentiality, in which words
                                are bound to single meanings,” a possessiveness that is said
                                to similarly characterize most other commentaries on the
                                heroine’s role in <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of
                                    Albion.</hi> The “open” language that Blake
                                invented for Oothoon is contrasted with Bromion’s
                                “rigidly univocal, exclusive, and divisive” (11)
                                diction. To Heffeman “Oothoon remains a fascinating outsider
                                because her attitude will not fit the structures of power and
                                submission with which societies customarily organize themselves, and
                                her language will not fit the categories of possession and
                                opposition that we customarily use to define ourselves and our
                                relation to others. She neither wins nor loses. She challenges the
                                assumption that love means exclusive possession; she challenges the
                                oppositions between fidelity and promiscuity, holiness and
                                sensuality, the intellect and the senses, punishment and
                                self-gratification, submission and transgression, defeat and
                                victory. But she neither converts the men who oppress her nor
                                liberates herself from them” (18). This then is another
                                important contribution to the renewed debate over the meaning of 
<hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> and <hi rend="i">Visions of the

              <p>—Heppner is here addressing a critical fallacy that is
                                characteristic of a great deal of earlier Blake scholarship, viz.
                                the insistence that those of the artist’s series of
                                watercolors and engravings that are illustrations of the literary
                                works of others are also <hi rend="i">generally</hi> to be
                                understood as modifications and ironic criticisms of the poets and
                                poems illustrated. Though the author grants that “it is often
                                clear” that such commentaries “are right,” he
                                points out that “sometimes the expectation of finding such
                                criticism can be a cause of error—the antithetical meaning is
                                given a premature welcome before an adequate search has been made
                                for a more fully articulated reading of the design” (64). In

              <p>—In this short article Hoagwood attempts to exemplify how
                                “William Blake constructs a literary theory which is also
                                more generally a Christian aesthetic. . . . Blake’s
                                philosophy of literary form, which is always precisely a philosophy
                                of biblical literature, involves two essentially semiotic or
                                iconographical principles. These principles, these means of meaning,
                                are drawn from the tradition of biblical literature and exegesis,
                                and Blake uses them to reproduce the act of signifying that he
                                associates specifically with the Bible. He goes farther, too,
                                identifying Christian value within this act of signifying rather
                                than in what is signified alone, so that the act of meaning and not
                                just what is meant constitutes a major value. Blake’s two
                                literary principles I shall be explaining as <hi rend="i">metalanguage</hi>
[i.e., language about language] and <hi rend="i">visualization of vision</hi>” (80).</p>

                                images across the text. . . . The existence of clearly pronounced
                                patterning of the kind revealed by Fourier analysis for the image
                                data is astounding” (218), especially, one feels tempted to
                                add, to those who do not trust what is “perceivable by
                                eye.” What are the conclusions that can be substantiated by
                                such computer-assisted analyses? In summarizing her results, Ide
                                points out this much: while “the analysis does not tell us
                                what this patterning means in terms of the poem’s effects,
                                there can be little doubt that the 3-cycle pattern apparent in the
                                plots of the original image data are real. Whatever else we make of
                                it, the Fourier analysis can be confidently said to show the pattern
                                of image distribution in the <hi rend="i">Zoas</hi> is both 
<hi rend="i">rhythmic</hi> and <hi rend="i">simple.</hi> As a poet
                                and a painter, Blake was overwhelmingly concerned with rhythm,
                                harmony, and symmetry in his philosophy and art. . . . Anyone
                                familiar with Blake’s art is aware of his attention to
                                symmetry and form in his visual imagery as well. Given all of this,
                                the patterns suggested by the Fourier analysis—whether they
                                were consciously or unconsciously imposed on the poem—are
                                especially deserving consideration in Blake’s work”
                                (219). With the help of a powerful computer Ide has thus
                                rediscovered for herself a problem of interpretation which others
                                may have assumed is self-evident; there is probably nothing wrong
                                with this, though it is not quite clear how Fourier analysis may
                                help to <hi rend="i">solve</hi> that problem. If, however, the
                                process of analysis turns Blake’s <hi rend="i">Four Zoas</hi>
                                into “<hi rend="i">The Fourier Zoas</hi>” (218), such
                                conservative reservations may indeed miss their mark entirely.</p>

Ide again
                                concentrates on <hi rend="i">Vala, or The Four Zoas.</hi> Here she
                                informs her readers that “despite . . . problems [of
                                definitions and methodology] the computer has enabled [her] to look
                                at the text of the <hi rend="i">Zoas</hi> and see Blake at work as
                                no one has before” (123). Ide discusses “The Literary
                                Problem” (123-27) and its “Computational
                                Solution” (127-37), and finally presents a
                                “Consideration of the Results” (137-39). Even though
                                the latter are basically quantitative rather than qualitative, Ide
                                claims that hers actually “constitutes the most comprehensive
                                study of the imagery of Blake’s prophetic poetry, and one of
                                the most comprehensive studies of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> to
                                date” (138). At the time of writing the author probably had
                                not yet had a chance to study Donald Ault’s <hi rend="i">Narrative
Unbound</hi> of 1987; however (and besides their
                                fascination with charts), there is at least one thought that is
                                common to Ide and Ault: like Ault in a recent article (see #42,
                                above), Ide “wonders what the authors whom we dissect and
                                analyze would think of the work we do.” Even without the help
                                of Blake appearing to her in a dream (as he did to Ault), she, too,
                                “cannot help but think that Blake, who forever urged new
                                perspectives, would be somewhat pleased with my approach, and that
                                the poet who adored the juxtaposition of opposites would find the
                                application of Reason’s tool to the study of the fruits of
                                the Imagination somehow appealing” (138-39). Is this
                                irony?</p>
              <p>132. Ide, Nancy M. “A Statistical Measure of Theme and
                                Structure.” <hi rend="i">Computers and the Humanities</hi> 23
                                (1989): 277-83.</p>
              <p>—Yet another paper by Ide which describes a
                                “computer-assisted analysis of semantic patterning in William
                                Blake’s <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>” (277). Though
                                there is considerable overlap between the three articles by Ide
                                recorded here and the same author’s earlier publications on
                                    <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> (all of which appear to be based
                                on her 1982 Ph.D. thesis; see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 17[1983-84]:
                                66 [#86]), there are also some significant changes in focus, method,
                                and even the numerical data that were employed for these excursions
                                with Blake into the realms of electronic space. Whereas <hi rend="i">The Four
Zoas</hi> is always introduced by Ide as “a
                                narrative poem,” I felt a little puzzled when here I found
                                that it contains “some 45’000 words” (277),
                                while there were only “some 42’000 words” in
                                the 1988 article (194 in #130, as cited above). Could it be that
                                Ide’s computer has discovered yet another additional
                                “Night” in Blake’s poem? Readers primarily
                                interested in Blake, not in the techniques of computer-based analyses
                                of literary texts, may want to turn to Ide’s earlier paper
                                that was published in this journal (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 22
                                [1988-89]: 46 [#77]) before delving any deeper into the computer

                                Blake is aligned with the biblical prophets not so much because of
                                [his use of the larger structures and devices of the Bible,
                                especially those identified in biblical exegeses] in his work as
                                because of his stance, his purpose, his revisionary treatment of
                                traditions, and, most importantly, his visionary perception that
                                penetrates the barriers of time and space, subject and object, and
                                divine, human, and natural. Such perception and the other
                                characteristics are registered in his style and are also in similar
                                forms found in classical prophets.” Particular attention is
                                paid to <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> “as a
                                representative book of Blake’s ‘Bible of
                                Hell,’” where Imamura reads Blake as demonstrating his
                                peculiar “way of allusion which at once affirms the
                                predecessors’ visions and corrects their contexts. <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>
also implicitly points to the failure of
                                the biblical and Miltonic mode of prophecy as Blake sees it, in
                                contrast to his own heuristic mode of prophecy that attempts to
                                induce a mental apocalypse in the reader’s mind.” This
                                dissertation then, while shifting the focus from narrative to style,
                                nevertheless appears to be informed by a heavy dose of Bloom, <hi rend="i">The
Anxiety of Influence</hi>, and a couple of other
                                previous examinations of Blake’s understanding of the
                                “Language of Prophecy.” For another dissertation that

              <p>—This unpublished typescript of what is the Swiss equivalent
                                of a master’s thesis explores the numerous depictions of
                                women in Blake’s Bible illustrations, their tradition, their
                                form and content, and the gender-related questions raised by this
                                imagery. Unlike Anne Mellor, Immenhauser grants to the women
                                depicted by Blake more than “but two roles to play”
                                (140). Her study is, to the best of my knowledge, the first attempt
                                by an art historian to come to terms with the implications of the
                                representation of women in Blake’s works. Though the
                                typescript I have seen unquestionably calls for some thorough
                                copy-editing, the range of Immenhauser’s text is certainly
                                impressive, and some 850 notes demonstrate the thoroughness of her
                                reading in both Blake and women’s studies. Following a brief
                                but competent summary of previous feminist Blake criticism (9-11),
                                part I (1-72) describes the Bible as Blake’s “Great
                                Code of Art.” By necessity Immenhauser here recapitulates
                                much that is already well-known from earlier publications. And yet
                                one hopes that at least a revised and expanded version of part II on
                                “Das biblische Frauenbild” (76-143) is to be published
                                in the near future. This would usefully contain the descriptive
                                analysis of “An Allegory of the Bible” (28-29) and the
                                sections from part I that are concerned with Blake’s
                                responses to the female in the imagery of Michelangelo (69-72),
                                Raphael (29-31), and Fuseli (42-46), as well as those containing
                                observations on the typology of female imagery in eighteenth-century
                                British art and art theory.</p>

              <p>—“That which can be made Explicit to the Idiot,”
                                Blake wrote to Trussler in 1799, “is not worth my
                                care” (E702). He sure meant what he said, and many a reader
                                of this journal would see no reason to renew her or his subscription
                                if Blake’s works all of a sudden were to appear as
                                “Explicit.” The present article participates in that
                                everlasting endeavor of Blake critics to elucidate the poet’s
                                meaning by addressing his “Use of Religious Language.”
                                James surveys “the subversive implications of Blake’s
                                works” (42) that he finds attached even to “common
                                nouns which constitute the conventional currency of religious
                                discourse, <hi rend="i">e.g.</hi>, ‘the divine,’
                                ‘the eternal,’ ‘the miraculous,’
                                ‘the holy’” (31). The examination of
                                Blake’s use of terms such as “the divine”
                                (31-33) and “the holy” (33-34) leads James to
                                reconsider Blake’s Swedenborgian connection (35-36), the
                                identity of the creator in “The Lamb” (36-37),
                                “Jerusalem” from <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (38), the
                                question of Blake’s particular brand of radicalism, here set
                                off from that of the “New Left” (39-40),
                                deconstructive theory and (a true first, I think) feminist theology

              <p>—Finding that “Blake’s views concerning
                                sexuality—or concerning <hi rend="i">sexual politics</hi>,
                                implying both the political dimension of male-female relationships
                                and the socialization of sexual ‘instincts’ in modern
                                society—have been studied [up to 1987] from a rather narrow
                                angle” (65), and following a short aside on “what
                                might be called the ‘occult’ school” of Blake
                                criticism (66), Johansen proposes “to relate some of
                                Blake’s texts to the history of sexuality, concentrating on
                                his early works and <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> . . . in the
                                light of theses put forward in Michel Foucault’s <hi rend="i">The History of
Sexuality</hi>” (67). The article
                                examines the role of sexuality and its “implicitly or
                                explicitly political status” (71) in some of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>
(69-72), in the <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>, and in
                                the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (72-73), and optimistically
                                “sum[s] up Blake’s sexual politics” by
                                insisting that the poet “remains all his life a firm believer
                                in the need for a sexual revolution, a revolution that implies a
                                radical transformation of the prevalent (repressive) sex role
                                pattern, which liberates male as well as female sexuality, but which
                                at the same time does not <hi rend="i">isolate</hi> sexuality from
                                other issues, from the total life-historical context” (74).

              <p>—Any new attempt to come to terms with the
                                “meaning” of Blake’s art and poetry is subject
                                to the pressure being put on the present by the ever-growing burden
                                of past scholarship. Since the mid-century, no such thing as a
                                “fresh” reading of Blake’s works has been
                                possible, at least not in professional and institutionalized art and
                                literary criticism. Scholarly “innocence” has long
                                since given way to a state of critical “experience.”
                                Of course, there is nothing specifically Blakean about such a
                                situation very similar to that in which, say, the students of
                                Milton’s <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> or of
                                Wordsworth’s <hi rend="i">Prelude</hi> find themselves
                                entangled. Still, the scholar who embarks today on yet another study
                                of “The Tyger,” after “Jerusalem”
                                Blake’s most popular poem and, I believe, the lyric that has
                                been scrutinized more often than any other of his poems, will (and
                                should necessarily) feel the weight of earlier interpretative
                                efforts as an almost suffocating presence. Inder Nath Kher proves to
                                be aware of this in the latest attempt to come to grips with the
                                fearful symmetry of Blake’s beast. Therefore, more than half
                                of the present article is devoted to a discussion of a few selected
                                earlier (and now somewhat dated) readings of “The
                                Tyger” by Bloom (75-77), Hirsch (77-78), Adams (78-79),
                                Gleckner (79-80), and Ostriker (85). Commencing with the assertion
                                that “Blake must, of necessity, be approached through the
                                principle of the archetype in poetry” (72), Kher states that
                                for this new investigation “I am not presuming/claiming a
                                better degree of perception than most critics have displayed. This
                                paper only hopes to achieve one more level of appreciation,
                                different in intensity of response, though not altogether
                                exclusive” (74). Such rare scholarly modesty proves to be in
                                line with Kher’s own interpretation of the poem (80-85),
                                which is informed by “close reading” techniques and
                                reserves the last words for the teachings not of criticism but of
                                the mother of Blake’s “Little Black Boy.”</p>

                                working on a new and deeply studied biography of the poet and artist
                                for many years, and considerable as well as fruitful controversy is
                                to be expected from that book if one may judge its contents from
                                Ward’s reshuffling of traditional assumptions about
                                Blake’s career in some of her recent articles. Peter Ackroyd,
                                time-leap novelist of Hawksmoorian and Chattertonian fame,
                                biographer of Eliot, Dickens, et al., is also reported to be engaged
                                upon a Blake biography. (It seems more than likely that this will
                                contain the first “interviews” with the deceased
                                master since the time of Crabb Robinson.) However, James King,
                                editor and biographer of Cowper, has been faster than them all and
                                here presents a new version of <hi rend="i">His Life.</hi> One is
                                curious to find out the merits of this short book (263 pages, the
                                index and illustrations included): is this just another popular
                                introduction to the “life and work” of Blake, or that
                                long-expected scholarly work, destined to update and in part replace
                                received opinion as represented by the earlier standard biographies
                                by Alexander Gilchrist (1863) and Mona Wilson (1927)? Unfortunately,
                                with the possible exception of the “new emphases” in
                                its chapters on “Blake’s strained friendship with . .
                                . William Hayley” (139), King’s book offers no major
                                breakthrough. Rather, it is at best no more than an overview of the
                                biographical information available in Bentley’s <hi rend="i">Blake
Records</hi> (1969, supplemented in 1988) and current
                                opinions on the interpretation of these sources. It is lacking a
                                detailed critical apparatus, and adds nothing that is entirely
                                new—except for the punctuation that King has
                                “frequently inserted” [230] in Erdman’s text of
                                    <hi rend="i">The Complete Poetry and Prose</hi> and in sources
                                that he cites from <hi rend="i">Blake Records.</hi> Whereas King
                                does not seem to make use of any newly discovered documentary
                                evidence in his biography, he is strongly inclined to see
                                Blake’s poetry and pictures as “an expression of
                                personality and thus . . . deeply autobiographical” (xvii).
                                The author rightly feels that Gilchrist, who was drawing on
                                “the recollections of disciples who knew [Blake] at the end
                                of his life [when, accidentally or not, Blake had] altered the
                                record,” produced an “extremely Victorian” book
                                (xv). However, in characterizing Blake’s erotic imagination
                                as “sometimes pomographic” (xvii), in viewing
                                “random acts of brutal and perverted sexual activity”
                                (125) in some of the <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> drawings—and
                                nothing else, neither art, nor contextual meaning—and in
                                stating that Blake’s “envy and jealousy in <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> . . .
led merely to chaos” (xvii),
                                King does not appear too far removed from the normative and
                                ideological value systems he criticizes in his precursor. I found
                                this a disappointing and sometimes infuriating

              <p>—The author reports on what appears to be a restrike from the

Critical Miscellany</hi> 4 (1991): 139-56.</p>
              <p>—Blake saw “in Wordsworth the Natural Man rising up
                                against the Spiritual Man Continually &amp; then he is No Poet but
                                a Heathen Philosopher at Enmity against all true Poetry or
                                Inspiration.” Since, however, he could also praise
                                Wordsworth’s poetry as “in the highest degree
                                Imaginative” (E 665), and since Crabb Robinson reported on
                                the “intense” delight Blake received from reading
                                Wordsworth’s <hi rend="i">Poems</hi> of 1815 (140), this does
                                not unduly distract the author of the present paper. Lambo’s
                                “central concern . . . is to prove that Blake and Wordsworth,
                                in spite of some revealing differences between them, essentially
                                share the same world view” (139). Moreover, his paper
                                attempts to demonstrate that even “their attitude towards
                                nature, or the world as a whole, is essentially similar”
                                (141; see also 153). The <hi rend="i">tertium comparationis</hi>
                                which allows Lambo to contradict what appears to be the overt
                                meaning of most of Blake’s annotations to Wordsworth and of
                                his respective remarks to Robinson is, of course, the concept of
                                “the imagination.” As “the unitive principle
                                working behind the visible frame of things” (141-42), and a
                                generalization for that, this serves the desired purpose: to show
                                that “there is sufficient similarity between [the two poets]
                                to bolster up the juxtaposition. Referring closely to some of their
                                works, this paper forcefully [!] argues that Blake and Wordsworth
                                are convinced monists, that they are preoccupied with relations or
                                correspondences and, above all, that the imagination plays an
                                important role in their perception of the harmony that permeates the
                                universe” (153-54). See also #44 and 88, above.</p>

                                Scotland: Corbie P, 1991. £0.70 paper.</p>
              <p>—Readers of this pamphlet will learn that “William Blake
                                was an opponent of war,” that he “manifests intense
                                interest in Wales and Scotland” in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, that he
“may have been the descendant of
                                a Welsh family which migrated to Ireland,” and that the
                                “wrote about the Stone of Destiny, or Coronation Stone,
                                conceived as a symbol of imperial domination.” The author
                                (who died in 1985) saw clearly that Blake “was deeply aware
                                of the suppression of women” [iii]. Lamont’s paper was
                                first published in the July 1976 issue of the <hi rend="i">Scottish
                                    Journal of Science</hi> (227-43; not listed in Bentley 1977).
                                Neil Mathers, the editor of the present re-publication, rightly
                                draws attention to Lamont’s “writing style [that] is
                                at once highly readable and eccentric.” At the same time, he
                                points out—correctly, I feel—that “some may
                                find certain interpretations . . . somewhat bizarre”

                                45-61.</p>
              <p>—The author is convinced that there is something lacking in
                                previous interpretative descriptions of Blake’s series of
                                watercolors in illustration of Milton’s <hi rend="i">Nativity
                                    Ode.</hi> “What has not been adequately noted is the
                                extent to which Blake’s designs . . . are not merely
                                interpretive but also subversive, and that their vision of the
                                Incamation is in fact quite close to the sardonic reading of
                                Milton’s poem that informs <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>”
                                (45). Lawson notes the “ironic relation” of
                                “some characters and events of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>” with the 
<hi rend="i">Nativity Ode</hi> (46);
                                his reading, however, entails the “sensual fairy” of
                                plate 3, a text that was added to only two out of the 12 complete
                                copies of Blake’s prophecy that are known. (Note that the
                                author does not employ the standard order for the sequence of plates
                                in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> that has been established in Bentley
                                1977.) The essay, on the majority of its pages, then expounds an
                                interpretation of Blake’s iconography in his watercolor
                                series illustrating Milton’s ode. Lawson here detects
                                “a similar subversiveness” (48) to Blake’s
                                reworking of the ode in <hi rend="i">Europe.</hi> His analysis of
                                the Whitworth versions of the <hi rend="i">Nativity Ode</hi> designs
                                (here reproduced in monochrome and referred to, rather irritatingly,
                                as “Plates” throughout) starts out from the assumption
                                that because of “their close conformity to the visual imagery
                                of the ode” they reveal Blake’s “very close
                                reading of the poem and at the same time [cloak] the extent of his
                                reinterpretation of Milton’s vision” (50). As a means
                                to “un-cloak” that reinterpretation, Lawson first
                                draws attention to various (though isolated and fairly general)
                                visual resemblances of motifs one encounters in the Milton
                                water-colors and the pages of the illuminated book. For example, in
                                an interpretation that I think is truly Urizenic in its perspective,
                                he likens “the long scaled tail of the dragon” in the
                                fifth of the Milton designs to “the coiled tail of the
                                creature from the abyss” on the titlepage for <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, that
is of a figure which has traditionally been
                                identified as an image of Orc who, to the eyes of Albion’s
                                Angel, appears in serpent form, as the “rattlesnake”
                                of revolution. Lawson’s key to unlock what he sees as the
                                “subversive” meaning of the Milton series is, however,
                                Blake’s compass symbolism. When Anthony Blunt and others
                                examined the symbolism of the compasses in Blake’s works,
                                they thought of verbal or pictorial <hi rend="i">representations</hi> of the
instrument as it was used by
                                creators, builders, and mathematicians alike. Lawson takes his
                                readers one step further (or is it too far?) by assigning a negative
                                symbolical meaning, “bondage, constraint and darkened
                                vision,” to “compass angles” in general (52).
                                The shape of a stable roof (“the Urizenic roof
                                angle”), or the wings outstretched by an angel or by a demon,
                                all such motifs are characterized by “compass angles”
                                and, in consequence, they all share in the same evil and
                                “constraining” (54) meaning. Whosoever is prepared to
                                follow such reasoning may indeed discover a “veiled
                                interpretation” (56) of Milton’s ode in Blake’s
                                watercolors, and she or he will learn from Lawson and “from
                                the vantage of hell” to discern in these designs just as in
                                    <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> “subversive images of
                                constraining enclosures, sinister shapes and barely-controlled

                                ensure the linear, procreative, symbolic imperatives of the Father.
                                Both works reveal a sacrificial order in narrative whose <corr type="emend">metonymic</corr>
                                and metaphoric registers absent the mother. Both works also reveal a
                                related systematic violence against women, though Blake achieves
                                critical distance from that violence.” Lisberger’s
                                study thus participates in, and further contributes to, the critical
                                debate that, over the past three or four years and mostly driven by
                                feminist approaches, has led to a thorough reevaluation of the

              <p>—From this particularly short and remarkably abstract abstract
                                one learns that irony “is the form of a dynamic relation that
                                does not appear exclusively in the dimension of the text. The text
                                participates in a network of ironic polarities that implicate
                                psyches, families, genders, classes, institutions and disciplines.
                                In ‘Wheel within Wheel’ the ironic spiral is
                                elaborated between the poetry and letters of Wordsworth and Blake
                                and their circles, the early journalism and later criticism of Paul
                                de Man, several modern poems and the paradigms of postmodern physics
                                and cultural theory.” The examination of Blake’s
                                writings here contributes to “an alternative mapping of the
                                complex cultural plane as ‘rrheality’: a heterogeneous
                                field of interrelations at once real and rhetorical.”

              <p>—“Blake was the first writer of modern times to grasp
                                the fact that if you cannot define nationhood in terms that include
                                the city, and for that matter to give it real primacy, then you
                                cannot define it at all. This is not to say that the definition has
                                to be uncritical. The poet who wrote ‘London’
                                obviously didn’t think that” (88). In order to reach

              <p>—This is a study “in semiotics and rhetoric centered in
                                Blake’s poetry,” and it suggests what the author
                                believes to be “useful changes in academic discourse and
                                teaching methods.” Therefore, quite appropriately, Lundman
                                wastes no time over abstracted arguments, and his text reads more
                                like a candid program: “(1) Entropy and suppression are the
                                most significant features of language. . . . The lexicon of
                                Darwinist biology sensibly and usefully describes language. . . .
                                (2) Blake suppresses some word-groups to create distinct
                                ‘lexicons’ in <hi rend="i">Song[s] of Innocence and of
                                    Experience. MS Notebook</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
                                erasures and deletions subdue lexicons of self-expression and create
                                ‘I’-less discourse. (3) Contexts modulate sense. Blake
                                manipulates contexts to limit meaning when making a satiric attack.
                                Reader and author conspire to limit meaning. . . . (4)
                                ‘Species’ of discourses displace, parasitize, and
                                consume . . . (5) Looking for ‘voice’ one can become
                                ‘possessed’ by one or more discourses. Academic
                                language is (self-) interested and strongly invasive. . . .
                                Attending to a feminized/fecund moment or space may bring visionary
                                access to the larger Human Discourse which can deliver individuals
                                from the ‘I’-bonds of ‘single-vision’
                                which limit experience and fuller knowledge.” I reckon it
                                safer not to invade here with what is likely to be none but my own
                                self-interested academic language.</p>

              <p>—Lussier’s contribution to this special double issue of
                                    <hi rend="i">Visible Language</hi> commences with the question
                                whether or not Blake’s watercolor designs for Gray’s
                                ode “seek to elevate Gray’s poetry? If one reads the
                                language of the designs, the answer is ‘no’”
                                (205). With a little help from “Lacanian psychoanalytic
                                theory” (212), and by means of a commentary on each of the
                                six watercolors (all reproduced) for Gray’s “Ode on
                                the Death of a Favourite Cat” (208-16), the author
                                demonstrates how “Blake literally deconstructs Gray’s
                                text” and achieves what is here seen as a “staggering
                                imbalance of word and image” (206). In Lussier’s
                                psychological interpretation of Blake’s images, the
                                illustrations “to the opening stanzas present a drama. The
                                subject, Selima [i.e., Walpole’s cat and the example of
                                Gray’s moralizing ode], enacts a mirror stage encounter, and
                                the resulting split, pinpointed by Lacan as one of the products of
                                this encounter, can be read in the difference between the
                                subject’s appearance and that of its reflected image. . . .
                                Once plunged into the matrix of matter, subject and object undergo
                                transformations, finally to be revealed as narcissistic projection
                                onto the glass of nature. Blake offers, therefore, not a moral but a
                                psychological message that is also manifest in history as systems of
                                oppression that generate moral codes. Moreover, Blake equally
                                reveals that poetry can reify those projective oppressions”
                                (217-18). Because of “the deconstructive method of production
                                . . . Blake’s contra-diction of the unconscious . . . operates
                                on the margins [not just of the pages of the book produced for the
                                Flaxmans but] of Gray’s conscious discourse and unveil[s] the
                                phallic privileging of Gray’s association of the feline and
                                feminine, which consciously attempts to control feminine sexuality
                                through inner repression and outer oppression” (218). For

              <p>—Comparisons between Blake and Freud or Blake and Jung, as
                                well as “Jungian” readings of Blake’s poetry
                                and designs, have been fashionable for a long time, and the most
                                recent Jungian interpretations of Blake were published only fairly
                                recently (see, e.g., <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 22 [1988-89]: 44 [#57];
                                or 25 [1991-92]: 16 [#63-64]). In the near future, however, such
                                “Jungian” explorations may well be supplanted by
                                “Lacanian” readings, and here is a start in that
                                particular direction. Lussier shows himself convinced that the
                                “thought of William Blake and Jacques Lacan offers
                                interesting points of intersection,’ points that warrant a
                                close examination. “Blake’s illuminated texts promote
                                mirror-stage encounters with his readers, which require the
                                formation of self-consciousness before a self-conscious text.
                                Blake’s anticipation of Lacanian psychoanalytic concepts
                                begins in this mirror-stage and is traced in relation to <hi rend="i">The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell.</hi> In <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, Blake attempts to radically redefine
epic
                                conventions . . ., a move against epic that speaks to Lacanian
                                notions of the Symbolic order as the field of consciousness promoted
                                by knowledge. Blake attempts to subvert this order through the play
                                of word and design in his two prophecies, <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>
                                and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> . . . [where] this attack leads to
                                the exploration of feminine sexuality, since women are barred from
                                discourse in language itself, where language is the privileged
                                domain of phallocratic relations cast in the image of the
                                masculine.”</p>

                                [#141]). Because the title of the present article and that of the
                                first chapter in McGann’s book are the same, one is tempted
                                to assume that the two texts are identical. In fact they relate to
                                each other in much the same way that two pulls from the same
                                relief-etched plate in two different copies of an illuminated book
                                might (and quite appropriately so, since this sort of
                                “variation” in Blake’s works is part of
                                McGann’s subject here). For instance, part I of the journal
                                essay (43-45) has been incorporated in the introduction to the book
                                (26# 141: 5-8), the latter has much additional material (see 26#141:
                                14-15, 16-21, 24, 25, and 36-37), and there are numerous differences
                                in the precise phrasing of the two versions. Both texts do, of
                                course, agree in such memorable statements as the following:
                                “because Blake came to grips with the problem of truth as a
                                practicing artist, rather than as an academic, or a philosopher, his
                                philosophical significance is to be sought, and defined, in his
                                graphic and poetical work, and not in his ideas as such”
                                (56). It is nevertheless the chapter from McGann’s book, and
                                not the present journal publication, that is likely to be the one
                                that will be used for quotation in the future.</p>

              <p>—McQuail’s dissertation “examines the
                                significance of the variations between the original printed versions
                                of <hi rend="i">The [First] Book of Urizen.</hi>” It is based
                                on the author’s “inspections of the different
                                originals as well as recorded observations in the critical
                                literature on the subject,” and it offers her
                                “interpretations of significant variants” that draw on
                                “semiological approaches derived from studies of the visual
                                arts which combine word and image.” Therefore, “the
                                tradition of the emblem book” and Blake’s own Notebook
                                emblems as well as <hi rend="i">The Gates of Paradise</hi> are

                                and picture.” Next, the author turns to the “problem

                                (following McGann, et al.) “explained by the fact that the
                                work was a rewriting of the Bible . . . with reference to . . .

                                “also invoked in an interpretation of ‘The Bible of

              <p>—In this study of Blake’s writings of the 1790s the
                                author draws on his far-ranging acquaintance with the publications
                                of writers as diverse as Thomas Paine and Garnet Terry, Robert Lowth
                                and Alexander Geddes, Thomas Spence and Joseph Priestley, Richard
                                Brothers and Edmund Burke, Erasmus Darwin and William Warburton, and
                                many more. In what “amounts to an archaeology of
                                reading” (3) he frames the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>, the
                                Urizen trilogy, and the Continental prophecies in the context of the
                                political and revolutionary discourses prevalent during
                                Blake’s Lambeth years. The author’s central concern is
                                to move away from an iconographic identification of historical
                                events that may or may not be represented in a given work or one of
                                its lines or images. Dissatisfied with the tendency of previous
                                “historicist Blake criticism [to underestimate] the radical
                                significance of the formal dimension of the works,” Mee has
                                examined the rhetorics of the revolutionary debate. He has singled
                                out four discursive fields in order to situate Blake’s own
                                enthusiastic and radical rhetoric of the revolutionary decade, to
                                show that “Blake’s rhetorical practices operate across
                                a consistent political typology” (2), and to “open up
                                the texts.” While convincingly arguing that Blake, like his
                                radical contemporaries, was a “bricoleur” who
                                “unapologetically recombines elements from across discourse
                                boundaries,” altering “the antecedent discourses . . .
                                fundamentally . . . in the resultant structures” (3) of his
                                works, Mee has chosen to organize the chapters of his own book in a
                                more accessible and reader-friendly way. Following an explication of
                                his subject, his approach and his research interests in an
                                introduction on “Blake the Bricoleur” (1-19),
                                Mee’s first chapter employs the framework of the rhetorics of
                                “Popular Enthusiasm and Radical Millenarianism”
                                (20-74) to locate the place of the Lambeth books in history. Here it
                                is persuasively demonstrated that, for example, Blake’s
                                tendency to rework and “reuse the same material in different
                                contexts” is a “quality common to many of the radical
                                texts produced in the [Revolution] controversy” (10). This is
                                followed by a section entitled “‘Northern
                                Antiquities’: Bards, Druids, and Ancient Liberties”
                                (75-120) that offers an examination of the “parabolic style
                                of Blake’s illuminated books” and of the
                                characteristics they share with “eighteenth-century
                                conceptions of what primitive literature was supposed to be
                                like” (75). A third chapter discusses the poet’s
                                thematic and rhetorical exploitation of the discourse of
                                “speculative mythography” (121) and the cross-currents
                                between “Mythography and Politics” (121-60), showing
                                that it was part of “Blake’s poetic enterprise”
                                (160) to subvert scriptural authority and its political application.
                                Next, the book therefore describes “Blake’s use of the
                                Bible in the 1790s” (161) and the peculiar role played by
                                biblical criticism in the Revolution debate (161-213). In his
                                conclusion Mee addresses what in the context (not just) of this book
                                must indeed seem a “particularly pressing” subject
                                (214). Starting out from an observation made by Paul Mann and a
                                critique of Morris Eaves’s argument concerning
                                “Romantic Expressive Theory,” Jon Mee here asks for
                                the reasons responsible for Blake’s obvious failure to create
                                an audience that would listen to the <hi rend="i">Dangerous
                                    Enthusiasm</hi> of his early prophecies (214-26). (For
                                Mann’s article see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 20 [1986-87]: 83
                                [#127]; for Eaves’s see 15 [1981-82]: 85 [#48]; Mee’s
                                account of Eaves’s stance is, I think, rather polemical and
                                not entirely true to the latter.) This concluding chapter presents a
                                fine analysis of Blake’s socially complicated relations with
                                the book publishers of the 1790s in general, and the Johnson circle
                                in particular (see especially 220-24), as well as of their
                                consequences for Blake’s publication strategies. Though I
                                thought much of this most interesting, I was surprised to find that,
                                here as elsewhere in the book, the author still treats
                                Blake’s illuminated printing primarily as
                                “text” rather than as “picture gallery.”
                                Therefore, some of the conclusions concerning an understanding of
                                the peculiar properties of Blake’s medium—its
                                “indeterminacy” (McGann), or its “radical
                                variability” and “logic of difference”
                                (Carr)—and hence of its “message” appear, at
                                the very least, open to critical questioning (see 15-18 and 
<hi rend="i">passim</hi>; this matter will also be discussed at some
                                length in Joseph Viscomi’s forthcoming book for which see the
                                introduction, above). And yet these are very minor criticisms of a
                                book that is packed with truly absorbing material, all enormously
                                helpful in an attempt to understand more fully Blake’s
                                participation in the discourses current in Britain’s
                                “radical underworld” (McCalman) of the late eighteenth
                                century. It is an entirely different question, and one that applies
                                to all criticism, whether or not Mee’s optimistic hopes for
                                his “historical approach which does not close down but opens
                                up the texts it addresses” are indeed justified.</p>
              <p>174. Mee, Jon. “The Radical Enthusiasm of Blake’s <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and
Hell.</hi>” <hi rend="i">British Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies</hi> 14

              <p>—The author’s central concern is with “the
                                relationship between Blake’s poetic practice and the wider
                                prophetic discourse that existed in the 1790s.” Therefore, in
                                the present article he is “attempting to place Blake’s
                                    <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>
	<pb id="p26-102" n="102"/>

                                texts . . . [and puts] forward some general suggestions as to the
                                nature of Blake’s political rhetoric in the period”
                                (51). To this end, Mee studies Blake’s <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> alongside
some of the “enthusiast”
                                writings of Richard Brothers, Thomas Webster, and—at the core
                                of his essay—John Wright and William Bryan. Mee thus adds new
                                facets to the reconstruction of the historical climate that provided
                                the impulse for Blake’s visionary satire; moreover, the
                                historical investigation helps to throw into high relief the unique
                                elements in Blake’s stance in the debate between radical
                                religious enthusiasts and radical enlightenment philosophers. See

              <p>—“This study situates Romantic literature in a
                                historical narrative that runs from the Fall of the Bastille to
                                Waterloo, and places Romantic texts against contemporary events like
                                the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, and the rise of European
                                imperialism in Africa and Asia . . . At the same time, this study
                                considers the relation of the Romantic epic to narratives of
                                universal history from Hegel to Marx.” Combined with such
                                historical contextualizing is an analysis of the
                                “concept” and the “contradictions of
                                modernity.” Seeing the romantic period as an event that can
                                be likened to “the postmodern break in which the narratives
                                through which history is mediated to individuals are shattered by a
                                traumatic shift in modes of cultural production,” Meyer
                                characterizes <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (as well as the long
                                romantic poems and dramas of Goethe, Byron, and Wordsworth) as
                                responding “to this crisis of representation by reinserting
                                historical experience into an overarching narrative of development
                                that describes the evolution of the representative individual or
                                collective subject, ‘Man,’ in his fall into alienation
                                and self-division in social forms, and his rise toward utopian
                                self-(re)unification as a figure of desire for restored human
                                community.” Whereas this Blakean center, i.e. Meyer’s
                                account of the fall and redemption of the Giant Albion, may not
                                represent an entirely unfamiliar version, it is the circumference
                                supplied by the author’s attempt to historicize
                                “Narratives of Development” in “the period from
                                1789 to 1832” that lends interest to his investigations.</p>

              <p>—More than 10 years ago, in 1981, Melanie Bandy’s book
                                on <hi rend="i">Evil in the Poetry of Blake and Shelley</hi> was
                                published, followed in 1985 by Terence Hoagwood’s <hi rend="i">Traditions of
Blake and Shelley</hi>, and in 1986 by
                                Daniela Tandecki’s study of Blake’s critique of the
                                concepts of a moral law and of eighteenth-century morality (see 
<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 16 [1982-83]: 112 [#22]; 20 [1986-87]: 82
                                [#109]; 22 [1988-89]: 50 [#121]). Now, the “Problem of Evil
                                in the Works of Blake and Shelley” is being readdressed in
                                Miner’s dissertation as the “most outstanding
                                similarity” between the two poets. In order to demonstrate
                                that both poets “ultimately advocate a nonrational
                                understanding of man’s relationship to the cosmos and argue
                                that evil results from a faulty vision of this relationship,”
                                Miner starts out by examining similar as well as “different
                                formulations of the problem of evil” in Blake’s and
                                Shelley’s “juvenilia.” She then
                                “explores their shared attack on orthodox religion in their
                                early mature work.” Studying <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>, the 
<hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>, and “Blake’s minor
                                prophe[c]ies” alongside Shelley’s <hi rend="i">Queen
                                    Mab, Alastor</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Revolt of Islam</hi>,
                                the author finds that both poets “deconstruct accepted
                                thought systems and offer their own cosmologies that support a
                                revolutionary ideology.” Next, “the political,
                                historical, and ideological concerns” of the
                                “revolutionary poems” and “the problems
                                inherent in a strictly political revolution” are treated.
                                Miner reads Blake’s <hi rend="i">Vala, or The Four Zoas</hi>
                                and Shelley’s <hi rend="i">Hellas</hi> as depicting a
                                “revolutionary future” and “demonstrates that
                                their respective definitive works, <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and
                                    <hi rend="i">Prometheus Unbound</hi> evidence a refinement of
                                themes and . . . a marked similarity between their respective
                                solutions to the problem of evil: forging a new relationship among
                                man, divinity, and the cosmos.” In her concluding chapter
                                Marlene Miner “glances at Blake’s <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book
of Job</hi>, which encapsulates his
                                final vision, . . . and Shelley’s fragment, ‘The
                                Triumph of Life.’” From the abstract one cannot tell
                                what precisely the relationship is between this and previous
                                examinations of “The Problem of Evil” in
                                Blake’s works. For the most recent contribution to the

              <p>—Minot argues that “to interpret ‘hearse’
                                as a candleholder in the closing line of . . . Blake’s
                                ‘London’ is at least as justifiable as interpreting it
                                to mean either ‘bier’ or
                                ‘carriage.’” And he maintains that in favor of
                                his “interpretation are the rich religious associations that
                                the [‘candleholder’] reading calls up, especially if
                                one accepts the more specific meaning connected with Good Friday.
                                Then the irony becomes even deeper. Certainly such knowledge and
                                such connotations were not beyond Blake” (91).</p>

              <p>—Blake an “unknown” poet? In the 1990s this may
                                sound curious, if not downright false. And yet, addressing the
                                readership of a German newspaper, Möhring’s subtitle
                                is aptly chosen. Blake’s reputation in Germany generally
                                remains what it was in Britain <hi rend="i">before</hi> the
                                publication of Gilchrist’s biography in 1863. The article
                                therefore presents an introduction to the major themes in
                                Blake’s poetry, stressing their relevance for readers at the
                                end of the twentieth century, and urging the need for a German
                                translation of the complete writings. Möhring himself has
                                previously translated a selection from the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>
                                (see #378, below); he is now engaged in preparing the first complete
                                edition of Blake’s writings in German for a Munich publisher.
                                There can be little doubt that the translator’s success with
                                this project would have a major impact on the future reception of
                                Blake in the German-speaking countries. Once such an edition has
                                eventually been published, Blake can no longer be described as an
                                “unbekannter Dichter,” not even in Germany.</p>
              <p>183. Moskal, Jeanne. “Blake, Dante, and ‘Whatever Book
                                is for Vengeance.’” <hi rend="i">Philological
                                    Quarterly</hi> 70 (1991): 317-37.</p>
              <p>—Moskal argues that in the Dante water-colors “Blake
                                attacks Dante’s denial of posthumous forgiveness with a fine
                                sense of irony: Blake’s illustrations present Dante himself
                                as a human being who has himself been forgiven posthumously by God,
                                thus making Dante the perfect counter-example to his own theological
                                claim” (318). Well aware of recent developments in the
                                interpretation of this series of illustrations, Moskal takes
                                “as a cue Fuller and Baine’s contrary emphasis
                                [contrary to Roe or Klonsky’s allegorical readings] on
                                recognizing the Dantean context.” She shows why and how in
                                her view “Blake responds deliberately to Dante’s
                                presentation of a posthumous <hi rend="i">Inferno</hi> rather than
                                assuming that he treats the <hi rend="i">Inferno</hi> as another
                                mythical presentation of the human condition during life.”
                                However, she proposes that in his illustrations “Blake made a
                                systematic critique of Dante by taking seriously the questions about
                                forgiveness . . . that Dante’s poem raises” (319).
                                Moskal thus combines some elements from the earlier
                                “allegorical” <pb id="p26-103" n="103"/>
with others
                                from the new “illustrative” approach in her
                                interpretation. She draws attention to “a contemporary
                                British stereotype of all Italians as vengeful” and to an
                                idea of Italy that was functioning “as a sign of otherness
                                for the English” (319), current during the 1820s when Blake
                                produced his Dante watercolors and engravings. Then, Moskal examines
                                in detail Boyd’s translation of Dante and how it may have
                                helped shape Blake’s own visual and verbal reactions to Dante
                                (321-24). With the ground thus paved, she turns to a close reading
                                of Blake’s annotations to Boyd, of his conversations with
                                Crabb Robinson, and to an interpretation of selected motifs in some
                                of the <hi rend="i">Inferno</hi> watercolors. It does not seriously
                                distract from the interest of this paper that Moskal may be
                                attributing too much weight to Blake’s use of
                                “reversed (or mirror) writing” (330) in either <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
(see Paley’s pertinent note on
                                this phenomenon, 128-29 in #9, above) or in what after all is no
                                more than a dry-point inscription in a still unfinished proof
                                engraving for “The Circle of the Lustful” (330).
                                Similarly, it does not really affect her argument (and can therefore
                                easily be forgiven) if she writes of England’s foremost
                                sculptor of the period as Blake’s “fellow engraver
                                Flaxman” (331), or if she refers to the 1793 issue of <hi rend="i">The Gates
of Paradise</hi> as “For the
                                Sexes” (332). The author’s earlier studies of the
                                ideas of friendship and forgiveness in Blake’s art and
                                writings have been listed in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 23 (1989-90):

                                the tone for Moskal’s conclusions in the present article:
                                “Forgiveness in Blake is identified with the process of
                                reading and rewriting and appropriating one’s predecessors.
                                Blake’s representation of vengeance and forgiveness in the
                                character of Dante reflects Blake’s conviction that aesthetic
                                considerations form the circumference of human experience”

              <p>—In a passage from Joyce’s short story “A Little

                                seems to allude, with both substantive and thematic significance, to
                                the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> and <hi rend="i">Songs of

              <p>—O’Keefe here “suggests a new method of reading
                                Emerson, not as a self-contradictory philosopher, but as a mythic
                                poet.” The methodological model for such a reading of
                                Emerson’s essays “as prose-poems” is supplied
                                by “the rhetorical modes of William Blake,” and by
                                Blake scholarship. The result is that suddenly they “disclose
                                consistent patterns of archetype and myth.” “A
                                paradigm borrowed from Blake, the four archetypes of his myth,
                                organizes the whole study: Creation, Fall, Redemption, and
                                Apocalypse. . . . Emerson’s myth, like Blake’s,
                                envisions a unified, humanized cosmos, in which
                                ‘there’ is ‘here,’ the Not-Me is

                                1989.</p>
              <p>—Ossar’s subject, “the anatomical and
                                physiological sources of body imagery in the late poetry of William
                                Blake and the uses to which Blake put those sources,” may
                                seem surprising. However, if one thinks of the commercial engravings
                                executed by Blake for books of medical interest such as
                                Henry’s <hi rend="i">Memoirs of Albert de Haller</hi> (1783),
                                Earle’s <hi rend="i">Practical Observations on the Operation
                                    for the Stone</hi> (1793), or Brown’s <hi rend="i">Elements of
Medicine</hi> (1795), the artist-poet’s
                                knowledge of (if not his interest in) contemporary medical debates
                                seems less unlikely than at first glance one may be tempted to
                                assume. Having studied Blake’s “images derived from
                                the body” in his “Later Poetry” (i.e.,
                                everything from <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>), the
author claims that “Blake assumed
                                the role of a poet-healer who . . . depicted a salvation beyond both
                                the body and language itself as we know them.” Ossar first
                                presents “an overview of the changing state of physiology in
                                Blake’s time,” and then “contrasts the nature
                                of the polypus [a reference to Trembley’s polyp] as Blake
                                understood it and his Zoa Tharmas, who represents the principle of
                                physical, psychological, and social integration.” This leads
                                toward a description of “the two complementary approaches to
                                the problems of individual and universal disintegration, first,
                                Romantic Physiology and second, the literal embodiment of
                                language.” Apart from the original choice of subject, Ossar
                                has yet another surprise in store: “That Blake virtually
                                stopped publishing poetry during the last seven years of his life
                                and kept to visual art suggests that he saw language as ultimately
                                incapable of saying what is most important.” As an art
                                historian I feel tempted to accept this as a fascinating idea; I am
                                not entirely convinced though, that (or how) this suggestion can be
                                harmonized with, say, Crabb Robinson’s account of his
                                interviews with the aging poet.</p>

              <p>—That there are multiple voices, all uttering their own
                                narratives, and seemingly in search of a narrator to
                                “frame,” organize, or even systemize their mutually
                                exclusive accounts of what is happening in <hi rend="i">The Four
                                    Zoas</hi>, has long been recognized. This, however, is the first
                                post-Aultean attempt to “re-vision” Blake’s
                                narrative, and its argument is to be developed in a companion volume
                                to the author’s <hi rend="i">Constructive Vision and
                                    Visionary Deconstruction</hi> (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 22
                                [1988-89]: 42 [#29]; 25 [1991-92]: 27 [#153]). Of the six occasions
                                on which the epic makes “reference to the birth of
                                Los”—here described as “perhaps the most
                                remarkable instance of the poem’s multiplication of
                                voices” (633)—three are examined by Otto in some
                                detail and under the following headings: “The birth of Los
                                from Tharmas” (634-36), “The Spectre’s account
                                of the birth of Los” (636-37), “The Messengers’
                                account of the division of Urthona” (638-39), and “The
                                Divisions of Urthona” (639-41). Otto also looks briefly at
                                the speeches of “The Demons of the Deep and the Shadow of
                                Enitharmon” (644-45), and then addresses the more general
                                questions of “Narrative and Perspective” (641-44) and
                                of “The shape of the present” (645-48). The article as
                                a whole argues for a “narrative of embrace” (see,
                                especially, 648-51) in order to demonstrate “that a reading
                                of the poem need not produce results as disconcerting as Erdman and
                                [even Ault’s process of a ‘linear
                                re-visioning’] suggest. . . . <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>
                                is an attempt to reverse the movement of the Fall by constructing
                                what I shall call a narrative of embrace. It is only by embracing
                                the conflicting voices and narratives of <hi rend="i">The Four
                                    Zoas</hi> that one glimpses the shape of the fallen world and so
                                draws close to the apocalypse of Night the Ninth. . . . Rather than
                                escaping from the ‘Cumbrous Wheels’ . . . of the
                                fallen world, in a narrative of embrace one must move into proximity
                                with others and embrace apparently incommensurable and contradictory
                                accounts of events in that world” (632-33). The example of
                                the “Multiple Births of Los” is employed by Otto to
                                show how in “the fallen world, where perception is inevitably
                                a function of perspective, the narrator’s attempt to gather
                                together the fragments of the fallen world is necessarily
                                paradoxical. In an embrace, the voices of those embraced must have
                                as much weight as the narrative voice, for that which is embraced
                                continually disrupts and makes fluid the form superimposed by the
                                narrator. This means that a narrative of embrace cannot be completed
                                in any traditional sense, for to do so would be to transform an
                                embrace into an assimilation. Nevertheless, while continually
                                frustrating our desire for the kind of unity that might be
                                appropriate for a completed work, the poem does urge its readers to
                                draw the poem together in a rather 
<pb id="p26-104" n="104"/>
                                different sense. . . . In <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> we can see
                                Blake moving towards a literary form which continually foregrounds
                                the problems associated with <hi rend="i"><corr type="emend">re-membering</corr></hi> the
                                scattered and warring fragments of the fallen Albion” (650).
                                If I understand the author correctly, he would agree, however, that
                                because Blake is still moving towards such a form in <hi rend="i">The Four
Zoas</hi>, “the conversation in
                                ‘Visionary forms dramatic’” (651) as one
                                encounters it here has a status which remains <hi rend="i">somehow
                                    different</hi> from that in “a completed work”
                                (650) such as <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi></p>
              <p>192. Otto, Peter. “Time, Eternity and the Fall in <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen.</hi>”
<hi rend="i">Philological
                                    Quarterly</hi> 69 (1990): 359-76.</p>
              <p>—Unquestionably it is part of the critical consensus that <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> is
“Blake’s demonic or
                                inverted reading of Genesis.” With the “assumption
                                that the Fall is marked by the appearance of time and space,”
                                Otto here questions one of the postulates that are both central and
                                common, “despite the plurality of conceptual terms”
                                (359), to almost all earlier interpretations of the Genesis chapter
                                in Blake’s “Bible of Hell.” According to the
                                author’s reading of plate 3, ll. 1-2, “Eternity is
                                quite clearly able to incorporate error and, even more surprisingly,
                                some kind of sequential and therefore temporal progression”
                                (360). Moreover, “time and Eternity are used in <hi rend="i">The Book of
Urizen</hi> in such a way that they make
                                problematic the very model that critics have used to describe them.
                                In particular, the oppositional dualism between time and Eternity
                                which is implicit in much critical discourse about this poem breaks
                                down . . . for Urizen, even as he divides and as his withdrawal is
                                effected in time, is still in Eternity. . . . This simple inadequacy
                                of the traditional dichotomy between time and Eternity to describe
                                the multiplicity of time or the nature of Eternity in <hi rend="i">The Book of
Urizen</hi> becomes a decisive objection when we
                                investigate the nature of the Eternals” (361). Otto
                                elaborates on this idea in sections on “Time and
                                Eternity” (362-67), “A Double Withdrawal”
                                (367-71), and “Time in the Fallen World” (371-75).
                                Reading the sequence of events in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> in the
                                light of Heidegger’s “distinction between the ontic
                                and the ontological” (376n15), he finds that the
                                “sequential time which we first observed in our description
                                of the unfallen world has now [i.e., on plate 13, ll. 39-43] severed
                                its links with ontological time and the times of others. Time and
                                Eternity have been turned inside out, and sequential time no longer
                                appears as the form of ontological time; it has become an alien,
                                external force which determines our being. Sequential time has
                                become ontic time” (374-75). Otto’s article, then, may
                                be seen as a “Preludium” to the theme of his <hi rend="i">Constructive
Vision and Visionary Deconstruction: Los,
                                    Eternity, and the Productions of Time in the Later Poetry of
                                    William Blake</hi> (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 25 [1991-92]:
                                27-28 [#153]).</p>
              <p>193. Paley, Morton D. “Blake and Thomas Burnet’s <hi rend="i">Sacred Theory of the
Earth.</hi>” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 25 (1991-92): 75-78.</p>
              <p>—Though it is difficult to decide “precisely where
                                Blake is indebted to Burnet and where [the ideas shared by both
                                authors are] a matter of common tradition,” Paley
                                convincingly argues that “the many similarities between their
                                scenarios for the future of the earth, as well as the visual
                                correspondences discussed [and illustrated], strongly suggest that
                                Blake was familiar with <hi rend="i">The Sacred History of the
                                    Earth</hi>” (77). The author is certainly right in
                                stating that if Blake actually looked into a copy of an early
                                edition of Burnet’s late seventeenth-century publication,
                                then its engraved plates “are likely to have interested Blake
                                the engraver as well as Blake the cosmogonist” (75).
                                Paley’s comparison between the uncanny globe that can be seen
                                hovering over the priest-like figure in the frontispiece of copies
                                of <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> and the picture in the 
<hi rend="i">Sacred Theory</hi> that shows the earth in Chaos as a
                                disk filled by “a mass of jumbled particles” (76) is a
                                particularly striking one.</p>

              <p>—Rather than the results of his investigation, Parker’s
                                abstract describes in some detail the approach he has chosen. Though
                                its author is looking at some of those commercial engravings that
                                were designed <hi rend="i">and</hi> executed by Blake, this study,
                                with the publication of Robert Essick’s catalogue
                                raisonné of Blake’s so-called reproductive engravings
                                (see #24, above), may turn into a model for future research.
                                “William Blake’s book illustrations to the texts of
                                other non-canonical writers have been dismissed on the basis of
                                arbitrary standards and values that have little if any relevance to
                                Blake’s aesthetic, or, to the literary and historical context
                                in which they appear. Therefore, it is the purpose of this study to
                                provide a detailed examination of Blake’s designs to Mary
                                Wollstonecraft’s <hi rend="i">Original Stories From Real
                                    Life</hi>, William Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>,
                                and his <hi rend="i">Life of William Cowper</hi>, to demonstrate the
                                ways in which Blake’s commercial book illustrations form an
                                integral part of his creative achievement. My approach to
                                Blake’s designs include borrowing, and in some instances
                                revising strategies previously reserved for discussions of
                                Blake’s illuminated books as ‘composite art.’ I
                                include iconographic readings of these plates, as well as a
                                stylistic analysis which takes into account the technique for
                                producing a particular design, not as a stylistic limitation, or, as
                                a stage in Blake’s development as an artist, but rather, as a
                                mode of production having ideological as well as aesthetic
                                values.” Therefore, Parker describes the “interactions
                                and relationships between Blake’s own works and his
                                commercial illustrations, between Blake and the content of the text,
                                the personal as well as the ideological relationship to the author,
                                and . . . the demands of the publishing industry.” One may
                                feel somewhat puzzled by Parker’s assertion that
                                Wollstonecraft still belongs with the group of “non-canonical
                                writers,” and in his distinction between Blake’s
                                “own imaginative works” and “his commercial
                                illustrations” the language of art criticism and the
                                traditional “standards and values” that Parker intends
                                to attack and to deconstruct prove to be still alive and active.
                                Nevertheless, in principle at least, Jeffrey Parker’s
                                endeavor to rehabilitate that part of Blake’s productions
                                which after all financed and thus made possible his more
                                “original” and “imaginative” works seems
                                long overdue. That the abstract does not refer to some of
                                Essick’s exemplary studies which, after all, paved the way,
                                is a blemish which, I hope, has to be attributed to the limited
                                printing space that was allotted to its author by the editors of

              <p>—The author explores “the appearance and use in
                                contemporary journalism” (45) of the symbol of the tiger and
                                of its complex political meaning. “The examples cited here
                                show the term ‘tiger’ being applied to persons or
                                characteristics that are approached with disapproval. Blake, on the
                                other hand, attributes the tiger’s creation . . . to the
                                divine hand of the Creator. In so far as the tiger is a symbol of
                                revolutionary activity, it is given the sanction of its divine
                                origin. The nearest to this in the material discussed is in
                                Robespierre’s ‘Address’ as printed in <hi rend="i">Politics for the

              <p>—The craft of printing occasionally supplied metaphors and
                                literary symbols for Blake’s writings (229), and the
                                technical processes involved in Blake’s copperplate printing,
                                just as those used in the creation of his engravings and etchings,
                                are themselves invested with iconographic meaning. To a certain
                                extent then, his media function as an integral part of
                                Blake’s message in illuminated printing. That much has
                                entered the critical consensus of Blake scholarship during the past
                                decade, particularly through the efforts of Robert Essick, Morris
                                Eaves, and Joseph Viscomi (see Phillips’s note 4). The
                                subject that is being examined by Phillips in the present study is
                                therefore not limited to its mere chalcographical interest. The
                                author, having made Blake’s manuscripts and early poetry his
                                special field of investigation, and having previously examined the
                                evolution of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> “From Manuscript
                                Draft to Illuminated Plate” (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 14
                                [1980-81]: 89), here takes this work one step further. After briefly
                                commenting on the 1793 prospectus, he supplies his readers with an
                                “account of Blake’s invention of ‘Illuminated
                                Printing’ together with a 
<pb id="p26-105" n="105"/>
                                description of the genesis of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> as
                                originally produced using his process. By discriminating these first
                                issues it is possible to see how the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> evolved
                                from the original issue of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> in
                                1789 to that of the first combined issue of <hi rend="i">Songs of
                                    Innocence and of Experience</hi> in 1794. Blake’s process
                                and what it signified for him is then discussed in relation to the
                                conventions of illustrated book production and with regard to his
                                aesthetic and his epistemology” (206). At the heart of the
                                essay one finds an attempt to group the extant copies of 
<hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (and of a few copies now bound as part
                                one of the combined <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>) in a sequence of four
                                separate printings or issues of the plates (see 211-14—and
                                note that at least the first and second printing “may be
                                contemporary” [212], i.e., may have been executed at the same
                                time in what is simply a different shade of the same printing ink).
                                Similarly, the “<hi rend="i">first printing</hi> of <hi rend="i">Songs of
Experience</hi> [is] here established,”
                                and Phillips shows that it “was for a separate issue”
                                (214). He also offers what to my knowledge is an entirely new
                                explanation of Blake’s colorprinting process, suggesting that
                                each of the plates was passed through the press <hi rend="i">twice</hi>, first
being printed in monochrome and only then
                                being color-printed (see 214, 216, and n27). How it can be
                                demonstrated that this actually was the case and why Blake should
                                voluntarily have produced for himself the considerable problems in
                                registration that would be a consequence of such a working method,
                                as well as the duplication of the labor involved in the printing of
                                each plate, remain to be explained. Blake’s technical
                                innovations can generally be described as <hi rend="i">simplifications</hi> of
earlier procedures, and Phillips
                                himself stresses that Blake appears to have avoided
                                “complicated and awkward” (209) techniques. Therefore,
                                one is eager to see how much of Phillips’s hypotheses will
                                hold up in the light of the reconstruction of Blake’s
                                production techniques in Joseph Viscomi’s forthcoming <hi rend="i">Blake and
the Idea of the Book</hi> (see the
                                introduction, above). Following the reconstruction of what is
                                described as the “<hi rend="i">second printing</hi> of <hi rend="i">Songs of
Experience</hi>” (218), Phillips turns
                                to an examination of the relationship of illuminated printing
                                “to the conventions of book production as Blake knew them
                                [see 219-22], to the theory of sculpture that may have influenced
                                its inception [see 222-26] and to its relationship to his philosophy
                                of mind [see 226-28].” The concluding section of the essay is
                                devoted to “Blake’s adaption of the pastoral
                                genre” (219; see 228-29). An important feature of the present
                                publication, both in buttressing the author’s sequencing of
                                the various printings and in their own right, are the eight color
                                plates from pages in copies A, C-D and I of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>, and

                                Vanderbilt U, 1990.</p>
              <p>—Blake’s reactions toward Milton and other
                                “precursors” have been studied in great detail whereas
                                the question of his own impact on younger poets has not been
                                confronted in the same measure by modern Blake criticism. And while
                                Dorfman, in 1969, presented a detailed analysis of Blake’s
                                “reputation as a poet from Gilchrist to Yeats” (see
                                Bentley 1977, #1509), Powers understands his dissertation as
                                “a work of literary history and literary mythology.”
                                He therefore “explores how William Blake has been
                                mythologized by his poetic heirs—beginning with his
                                discoverer D. G. Rossetti. . . . Taking his cue from Blake’s
                                term ‘emanation,’ Rossetti defined what I have termed
                                the emanationist theory of poetry. . . . Thus for Rossetti, the
                                literal artifact, or printed poem, was not an end in itself, a
                                completed object to be studied, but a means to . . . mental union, a
                                kind of ongoing dialogue between reader and writer. Subsequent
                                chapters explore the evolution of Rossetti’s emanationist
                                reading of Blake by later poets such as James Thomson [i.e.,
                                ‘B. V.,’ the author of ‘The City of Dreadful
                                Night,’ not of <hi rend="i">The Seasons</hi>], Walt Whitman,
                                William Butler Yeats, Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot and Allen Ginsberg.
                                Each chapter explores a different relationship with Blake.”
                                Powers finds that “despite these differences . . . each of
                                these poets ultimately repeated the gesture initiated by Rossetti:
                                the assumption of ‘Blake’—not the historical
                                figure, but the mythic figure, the Human Formed Word embodying the
                                prophetic, live, or oral spirit of poetry.” See also #200,

              <p>—The present book presents “an attempt to grapple with
                                the unconscious <hi rend="i">of</hi> romanticism.” And Blake
                                has been allotted an important place where it comes to solving this
                                “complex task which involves both the perception of
                                romanticism as a historical phenomenon and a continuous awareness of
                                the survival of romanticism as a mode of apprehension which still
                                conditions much of our culture and much of our critical
                                working” (ix). During the late 1970s and the first half of
                                the 1980s, Punter was among the first critics to engage with the
                                “Problems of Gender” as encountered in Blake’s
                                writings (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 13 [1979-80]: 96; 15
                                [1981-82]: 87 [#92]; 16 [1982-83]: 115 [#103]; 17 [1983-84]: 67
                                [#115]; 18 [1984-85]: 104 [#93]; 20 [1986-87]: 84 [#157-58]). As
                                part 3 of the present book, Punter now discusses “Romanticism
                                and the Self” in “An Engagement with Blake.”
                                There are sections dealing with “Problems of Gender”
                                (68-73), “Shame and Trauma” (73-78),

                                Blake” (83-86); Punter then addresses “Some
                                Dialectics” (86-90), “The Wise Man and the
                                Incorporation of the Feminine” (90-95),
                                “Haunting” (95-98), “Reflexivity”
                                (98-101), “Blake and Mysticism” (101-04),
                                “Kenosis and the Vortex, Interpretation and Fantasy”
                                (104-08), “Some Contexts: Blackwood, Lindsay, Swinburne,
                                Beckett” (108-14), and finally “Mysticism and
                                Psychosis: The Dark Dialogue” (114-17). Though these chapter
                                do in part arise from the author’s 1982 monograph on Blake
                                and dialectics and from some of his earlier articles on the
                                poet’s works and their canonization, Punter’s
                                reworkings have resulted in considerable shifts of focus and new
                                emphases. He now feels convinced that “Blake’s
                                writings . . . have a particular relevance for our purposes, because
                                of the central hiatuses which occur around the terminology and
                                syntax of the ‘Female Will’” (68). Besides a
                                reading of some passages from the <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>, Punter
                                concentrates on “Then she bore Pale desire” and on
                                sections from <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> He usefully
                                supplements Hilton’s and Goslee’s recent studies of
                                Blake’s poem “about empire, . . . mercantilism . . .
                                property, possession, ownership” (78), and he comments on
                                Blake as an “<hi rend="i">auteur</hi> who resists
                                de-authorisation,” whose name is “transmitted largely
                                without ‘difference,’ in either the heraldic or the
                                Derridean sense” (83), and who does not call upon the critic
                                “genuinely to deconstruct, rather to discover the principle
                                and procedures of auto-deconstruction in the texts
                                themselves” (84). The critical terminology employed by Punter
                                in the writing of this book (a mixture that has been drawn together
                                from a considerable number of disciplines and methodologies) is not
                                always easily accessible and certainly not “too
                                explicit.” However, Punter cannot be blamed for promising to
                                his readers anything like “straight lines” through his
                                reflections on literary narcissism and his own struggle with
                                “the inevitable problem of how to speak about that which is
                                not known” (ix).</p>

              <p>—Kathleen Raine’s numerous contributions to the
                                interpretation of Blake’s mythology and its dependence on an
                                essentially Platonic “tradition,” the “hidden
                                traces of the Perennial Philosophy” (3), no longer figure in
                                the current critical debates surrounding the productions of the poet
                                and artist in quite the same way they did during the 1960s and
                                1970s. The author’s life-long fascination with Blake has,
                                however, never ceased, and even over the past decade it resulted in
                                a series of articles that are here made available as a (the
                                ultimate?) collection of her “last studies.” From the
                                partly autobiographical introduction one learns that in “the
                                academic world researchers talk of their ‘subject,’
                                and often in both senses of the word—‘subject’
                                not only as a field of study, but also as if the poet were himself
                                ‘subject’ to their theories, often indeed
                                ‘subjected’ to the Procrustean mutilation of some
                                transient fashion.” True; yet how indeed it could possibly be
                                otherwise I do not know. But then I 
<pb id="p26-106" n="106"/>
                                suppose I would have to class myself as just another one of these
                                researchers, not as a poet. Kathleen Raine, however, has
                                distinguished herself as a poet in the very
                                “tradition” that she claims was also Blake’s.
                                And poets “read the same works [as researchers] but for other
                                reasons, principally in search of meaning and wisdom.” Raine
                                can therefore make a point of stressing that “Blake has not
                                been [her] ‘subject’ but [her] Master, in the Indian
                                sense of the word” (2). The eight essays that are
                                “collected in this volume do not constitute a systematic
                                study of Blake [such as Raine’s earlier books on the Master
                                did]. . . . All . . . were written for some specific occasion; most
                                are revised, to minimize repetition, and some extensively

              <p>—Examining “how Blake’s changing attitudes
                                toward Homer and the classical tradition affected his poetic and
                                philosophical development,” the author finds reason to take
                                issue with “most” earlier critics who merely
                                “downplayed the importance” of the shift leading from
                                Blake’s involvement in British neoclassical thought to his
                                later condemnation of “‘The Greek and Roman
                                Classics’ as ‘the Antichrist.’” Richey
                                is “convinced that [Blake’s] seemingly contradictory
                                statements reflect a dramatic change in Blake’s thought
                                which, to a large degree, determined the character of his later
                                poetry.” Following a study of the neoclassical motifs in <hi rend="i">The
Book of Thel</hi> and the “Bible of
                                Hell,” the dissertation describes in detail the effect that
                                the friendship with Hayley had on Blake’s use of elements
                                from the classical tradition. “Blake began incorporating
                                allusions to key episodes from the <hi rend="i">Iliad</hi> and 
<hi rend="i">Odyssey</hi> into <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> . . . . By
                                1804, however, the combined effect of Blake’s disenchantment
                                with the French Revolution, his growing resentment of
                                Hayley’s patronage, and his trial for sedition caused Blake
                                to re-evaluate the classical tradition completely.” In 
<hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> he
                                “waged a crusade against the classics to cure England of
                                ‘the infection from the silly Greek &amp; Latin slaves of
                                the Sword.’” Though the latter is known well enough,
                                Richey’s dissertation may contribute to the current promotion
                                of a revised and more positive view of Blake’s friendship
                                with Hayley (see also #147, above).</p>

              <p>—Rotenberg starts out with the following questionnaire in
                                mind: “Does poetry make possible a special kind of vision?
                                Does it achieve a ‘privileged view’ of the
                                ‘heights’ or does it supply another visionary code
                                that writing itself undermines? In visionary poetry, which joins the
                                dread of sight to an even deeper engagement with vision, contrary
                                images of vision are yoked together. More than any other poet,
                                William Blake constructs a mythology that embodies the dynamics of
                                visionary perception within poetry, a visionary poetry by nature

                                the light of “Heideggerian conception[s]” (93) leads
                                to the recognition that it is “poetic language that
                                intrinsically supplies the poet with the grounds for visionary
                                perception. Nonetheless, what is coded as an
                                ‘infinite’ vision in <corr type="emend">visionary</corr> poetry should be decoded
                                both as fear of vision and a vision of fear. Underlying the sublime
                                visions of poetry is a terror of vision and a vision of death.
                                Visions of death necessarily involve the visionary writer with the
                                limits of his own vision, and it is this double sense of finitude he
                                must face when he begins to create. The visionary writer necessarily
                                fears the vision that he drags out of darkness; and when he sits
                                down to write, it is that fear he ultimately transcribes”

                                Narrativity and Ideology.” <hi rend="i">Genre</hi> 23 (1990):
                                205-26.</p>
              <p>—According to Rothenberg, what has been
                                “forgotten” in much “recent provocative
                                scholarship devoted to . . . Blake’s <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> . . . is an
account of the historical conditions
                                enabling both Blake’s discourse and that of postmodern
                                literary theory, or an inquiry into the historical relationships of
                                those discourses.” The article, therefore, commences with a
                                critique of those “a historicist readings of Blake”
                                which are here said to in effect “reproduce the narrative
                                closures, interpretive exclusions, and metaphysical claims that are
                                the focal points of Blake’s attack on the oppressive effects
                                of a particular, historical world view” (205). As much
                                concerned about the present as about history, Rothenberg then argues
                                “that <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> exposes—and condemns
                                as oppressive—the hidden metaphysical assumptions and
                                self-legitimating maneuvers of narrative in order to provide us with
                                an analytics of the processes of exclusion, binarism, negation,
                                hierarchizing, and transcendence that give rise to the production of
                                the textual features we call narrative.” Rather than aligning
                                Blake’s position with “cherished liberal assumptions
                                about the origin and nature of liberty,” her reading attempts
                                to clarify how and why “<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> shows
                                that the claims to liberty of the Enlightenment subject rest on
                                unfounded metaphysical appeals that reproduce all the features and
                                rationalizations of social tyranny. . . . As a result, the poem
                                articulates a historical disjunction between liberalism and
                                radicalism, unraveling the causes of liberalism’s apparently
                                inevitable reproduction of and complicity in the conditions of
                                oppression it attacks” (206). The same case, though in much
                                more general terms, has been made before, for example in
                                Woodring’s <hi rend="i">Politics in English Romantic
                                    Poetry</hi> of 1970. Nevertheless, I think it is important
                                that—and like Essick in a recent article (see #107,
                                above)—Rothenberg insists not so much on the poet’s
                                wearing the Red Cap of Liberty in the streets of London, but (and a
                                few years ago this might still have seemed heretical) on his
                                “insight that the Enlightenment narratives of liberty and the
                                self are dangerous because they provide precisely the conditions and
                                legitimations for oppression on which tyranny historically has
                                relied” (225). Because here as in two of her earlier
                                publications Rothenberg concentrates on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>,
                                her forthcoming book (see the introduction, above) is likely to
                                center on an analysis of discursive structures in the same work.</p>

                                and Moral Verse for Children.” <hi rend="i">Essays in Arts

              <p>—When writing and etching the plates of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, Blake followed
“established models and in so
                                doing radically changed their traditional intent and effect and in
                                several ways transcended them” (15). These
                                conclusions—and the author seems to be aware of
                                this—will not sound altogether unfamiliar to the seasoned
                                Blake scholar. Also, one may really have no need to be informed that
                                “Blake’s radical politics, mysticism, and
                                revolutionary artistry, his life and art are very much rooted in the
                                era in which he lived.” However, Smith’s article is
                                nevertheless quite useful in various ways. It offers a brief
                                introduction to an “all but forgotten literary genre”
                                (1), its major exponents such as Bunyan, Watts, Wright, Foxton,
                                Doddridge, Cotton, Marchant, Wesley, Smart, Barbauld and their works
                                (2-5), and to the “the aim of the genre” (5) as a
                                whole. Smith then describes the general similarities in the format,
                                the length of the verses, their simple language, their preferred
                                meters, and the shared subject matter that characterize moralizing
                                eighteenth-century children’s verse and the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (7-12).
Finally, this is followed by a discussion of
                                the divergence of Blake’s lyrics from the practice of earlier
                                religious verse especially in the references to Christianity

              <p>—There may be “little or no direct allusion to Blake in
                                    <hi rend="i">Billy Budd</hi>” (13), yet at the same time
                                the Blakean quality of Melville’s novel “is evident in
                                its treatment of themes such as innocence vs. experience,
                                institutions vs. individuals, the natural and spontaneous vs. the
                                artificial and repressive.” Stanton certainly has sufficient
                                documentary evidence to offer to make his case a very plausible one.
                                It is known that by “at least 1870” (12) Melville
                                owned a copy of Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life</hi>, and that
                                while he was at work on his final revisions of <hi rend="i">Billy
                                    Budd</hi> in 1888 he read about Blake’s poetry in a
                                scarce book by “B. V.” (1834-82). Melville’s
                                friend James Billson had sent him one of only 160 copies of the
                                British poet James Thomson’s <hi rend="i">Shelley, a Poem; .
                                    . . to Which Is Added an Essay on the Poems of William

                                circulation. Stanton, of course, is primarily interested in
                                demonstrating how Melville’s acquaintance with part of
                                Blake’s writings and with Thomson’s essay helped to
                                shape some of the episodes and the literary characters for <hi rend="i">Billy
Budd</hi>(14-15); the student of Blake, however,
                                is likely to be particularly struck by the quotations here offered
                                from Thomson’s “Essay.” This text, by the way,
                                started as no more than a review of Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life</hi>, but
it is full of promises that have been fulfilled
                                (if they have or can be fulfilled at all) by Blake studies only a

              <p>—Starting out from the observation that both Blake and Paine
                                “were part of an artisan milieu which bred independence,
                                self-reliance, reformism, and creative activity,” the author
                                attributes to these shared “backgrounds and outlooks . . .
                                the basis for an iconoclastic affinity” (62). However,
                                Stevenson is well aware of the problematic question “of what
                                led Blake paradoxically to praise Paine’s deism while
                                condemning deism in general.” While he finds a provisional
                                answer in “an emotive commonality” between the two
                                men, and in the “political sympathies” and
                                “imaginative style” that Blake may have admired in
                                Paine (63), Stevenson’s “Reflections” lead to a
                                result that is in keeping with other recent reexaminations of
                                Blake’s relationships with members of the Johnson circle:
                                “Blake understood, as Paine did not, that the liberal,
                                industrial state had the same potential to dehumanize as did the old
                                regime which it was supplanting. Had Paine read any of
                                Blake’s visionary poetry, the world’s most notorious
                                deist might have realized some of the dangers that his
                                ‘contrary’ free philosophy overlooked” (69-70).

              <p>—This book participates in the debate concerning
                                gender-related issues in the poetry of William Blake which has come
                                to “dominate” much recent Blake criticism (see also
                                #108, 122, 234, etc.). In a sequence of parallel and neatly
                                symmetrical moves, Storch examines “Patterns of Maternal
                                Loss” in early Blake (25-44) and early Lawrence (45-64), the
                                “Images of Women” in Blake (65-96) and Lawrence
                                (97-130), the (temporary) “Triumph of Masculinity in
                                Blake’s <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>” (131-56) and in
                                Lawrence’s <hi rend="i">The Plumed Serpent</hi> (157-78),
                                before she arrives at her conclusion. The latter stresses the
                                “Pastoral Reconciliation in Blake’s Illustrations to
                                    <hi rend="i">Virgil</hi> and <hi rend="i">Job</hi>, and in
                                Lawrence’s <hi rend="i">Lady Chatterley’s
                                Lover</hi>” (179-90; for a contrary view of the pastoral see
                                #58, above). On the book’s final page of text, one is told
                                that the “images of women and men depicted in Blake and
                                Lawrence make a powerful impression upon their readers because each
                                was able to get very close to the elemental sources of love and
                                hate” (190). This echoes a sentence from the
                                “Preface,” stating that these two artists “stir
                                powerful reactions in many people because they are in close touch
                                with the sources of love and hate in all of us” (xi), and the
                                author’s conclusions thus arrive at the desired <hi rend="i">quod erat
demonstrandum.</hi> On the way, readers will have
                                learned about Blake’s general affinity with Lawrence, about
                                images of mothers, daughters (including all those little girls in
                                Blake), emanations, the Shadowy Female and their male counter-images
                                in a series of interpretations in which, besides <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>,
Blake’s <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> manuscript (and its illustrations), 
<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, and the <hi rend="i">Virgil</hi> and
                                    <hi rend="i">Job</hi> illustrations figure most prominently.
                                Methodologically, Storch relies on “object-relations
                                psychoanalysis, specifically, the ideas of Melanie Klein,”
                                with the conviction that these views, because Klein “explores
                                the foundations of human nature, . . . can be especially revealing
                                when used to investigate works of art” (xi). Though
                                Storch’s analyses of the functioning of, say, Blake’s
                                images of the authoritarian father figures in Blake’s poetry
                                are suggestive and often convincing, the understanding of the
                                psychological relationships between the male and female protagonists
                                in Blake’s writings are <hi rend="i">not</hi> the
                                author’s central concern. Rather, Storch aims at a
                                psychoanalytical knowledge of the deeper and hidden layer of the
                                “unconscious material within Blake himself.” The
                                literary critic thus assumes the role of the analyst and becomes
                                engaged in what appears to me to be some sort of necromantic
                                therapy, and the entire study is informed by the author’s
                                creed that—to an unusual extent—“Blake has an
                                urgent emotional involvement with his themes and dramatic
                                enactments: his perceptions about human nature are ultimately
                                perceptions about himself” (xii). Many, if not all, of the
                                critical approaches that are currently in use in Blake scholarship
                                would allow one to accept this statement as a truism. However, some
                                would probably argue that these are perceptions “about
                                himself” <hi rend="i">and</hi> “about human
                                nature” as experienced by Blake in his social surroundings,
                                and that they were shaped by Blake’s conscious involvement in
                                the rhetorics of a complex field of aesthetical, linguistical,
                                political, and institutional discourses. Storch would possibly
                                agree, yet in her book has preferred what appears to me as a rather
                                narrow psychoanalytical focus on the poet as an individual and on
                                the “unconscious.” Still, I would like to stress that
                                her readings of the poetry and, in particular, of its
                                “treatment of women” and of the “accompanying
                                images of 
<pb id="p26-108" n="108"/>
masculinity and themes of male
                                bonding,” of the “response to women and to male
                                identity” (xi), of the “split images of menacing
                                women; defensive fantasies of enclosing wombs; phallic female forms;
                                and the notion of men as primary beings who give birth to women,
                                their <hi rend="i">emanations</hi>, only to reabsorb them in the
                                perfected state of redemption” (xii) in Blake’s
                                writings have little to do with the crude identification of the life
                                and the work in King’s new biography of Blake (see #147,
                                above). That there <hi rend="i">is</hi> a biographical context for
                                this imagery in Blake which had concrete and manifest reality 
<hi rend="i">outside</hi> as well as inside the realm of the merely
                                “unconscious” has recently been demonstrated (see

              <p>—Swearingen’s article on <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> had
                                probably been submitted for publication before some closely related
                                studies such as Wilkie’s book on Thel and Oothoon, or
                                Goslee’s “Questioning the Master Trope”
                                appeared in print (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 25 [1991-92]: 21
                                [#100], as well as #122, #234 in the present compilation). Unlike
                                Goslee he does not address the problem of race and gender here, but
                                follows earlier feminist readings of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>;
                                Swearingen sees that the poem “raises the question of sexual
                                difference in a dramatic, even inflammatory way” (203) and
                                invites, at the same time, “reflection . . . on the
                                subordinate question of property” (204). The author’s
                                synopsis of the events that are related in the illuminated book
                                considers “three distinct ways in which Oothoon might relate
                                to her past” as models of “identity” (203), and
                                it highlights the problematic relation of the private with the
                                public domain. “Can liberation be a subjective affair or does
                                individual illumination” such as Oothoon’s
                                “remain essentially quixotic? Such an individual challenge
                                remains a private event, unable to carry out the public translation
                                of one code into another. Nor does Blake rest his hopes on the
                                possibility that new vision will somehow expand from the individual
                                to the world. In one respect, then, the poem ends without getting
                                anywhere” (214). Though he finds “something different,
                                something unspoken, something almost certainly unthought, in the
                                ending of the <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>,” Swearingen (here
                                coming close to Herbert Marcuse’s aesthetics) knows of a
                                positive function in such an “open” ending. Blake
                                “lets Oothoon’s exposition of the old patriarchal
                                economy stand, lets it reveal how the principles of validation
                                victimize everyone. Meanwhile, in love, she exemplifies an openness
                                determined by no kind of exclusion, not even that of the
                                powermongers” (215). The article, I think, is also very good
                                where it comes to the purpose of the “chorus.”
                                “In striking contrast with the male figures, the
                                ‘chorus’ of women does not seek to speak <hi rend="i">for</hi> Oothoon;
they <hi rend="i">let</hi> her speak, . . . .
                                Without conceptualizing the rape and becoming locked in the same
                                economy by opposition, they add public significance to
                                Oothoon’s experience, deny that the story is private, and, in
                                making it typical, make it political” (214). Much like
                                Rothenberg (see #212, above)—or Blake
                                himself—Swearingen, too, shows no signs of disillusionment.
                                He seems convinced that there are still some lessons we may learn
                                from the investigation of the art and poetry of the past, and in his
                                concluding sentence thus turns to the present. Reading <hi rend="i">Visions of
the Daughters of Albion</hi> makes him call quite
                                vehemently for “a thinking that banishes the discriminatory
                                alterity of gender, suffering, and death” (215). I like this
                                a lot, and I hope many others will, too. Yet I still wonder (just as
                                I did in the late 60s) how such messages may “expand from the
                                individual to the world.” See also #122, 203, and 206-07,

              <p>224. Swearingen, James E. “Time and History in Blake’s

                                (1991): 109-21.</p>
              <p>—Following two and a half pages that introduce Blake’s
                                working methods, his social commitment and revolutionary
                                inclinations during the 1790s, and some elementary account of
                                Blake’s myth, Swearingen advises the reader to take
                                Blake’s “symbols as indeterminate,” so that the
                                act of reading “approaches the world in the mode of
                                questioning.” He then suggests that instead of “using
                                the concepts of time and history to interpret <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, we
will let the poem interrogate those
                                concepts.” The announcement is put into practice by a summary
                                of events in the “Preludium” (112-13), the
                                “Prophecy” (113-17), and the
                                “Fairy’s” additional plate (117-21). Swearingen
                                pinpoints those passages where it can be shown that in 
<hi rend="i">Europe</hi> “the image of linear time becomes
                                problematic as the time of natural cycles appears to subordinate and
                                deploy linearity within the pattern of repetition” (111).
                                There is some overlap here with, say, Otto’s study of
                                “Time and Eternity” in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (see
                                #192, above); however, where the latter concentrated on the ontic
                                and the ontological “versions” of sequential time,
                                Swearingen is concerned with linear and cyclical time <hi rend="i">in
history</hi> and distinguishes these by gendering the images
                                of linear time as the “masculine,” of the cycle of
                                natural recurrences in time as the “feminine” (120)
                                with the “Fairy” as “essentially
                                gender-neutral” (118). In Swearingen’s reading of 
<hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, this strategy allows for some surprising
                                revisions. One example must be sufficient here: “Both
                                Enitharmon and ‘Man’ must be more than natural
                                entities contained in her dream. Instead of being embedded, like
                                Orc, <hi rend="i">in</hi> time and looking ahead for some redemptive
                                event, she <hi rend="i">has</hi> time, and that makes her
                                historical. However restrictive in other respects, her experience
                                restores history to nature” (116). See also #156, above.</p>
              <p>225. Swearingen, James E. “William Blake’s Figural
                                Politics.” <hi rend="i">ELH</hi> 59 (1992): 125-44.</p>
              <p>—The third of Swearingen’s publications of the 1991-92
                                period is concerned with <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and devoted to
                                “an inquiry into the political implications of three levels
                                of vision: the efforts of Urizen to preserve things from time and
                                change [127-29], the labor of Los to build three-fold Golgonooza
                                [130-34], and the discourse of the Eternals as a perpetual beginning
                                that redeems everyday life [134-42]” (127). Asking whether or
                                not there is or can be “a polity of the Eternals”
                                (125), and “what might the polity of Jerusalem be”
                                (126), Swearingen first points out that “in situating
                                eternity within time, Blake displaces the dialectic of worldly
                                appetites in a kingdom of Satan and hope for otherworldly salvation
                                in a kingdom of Christ” (127; see also #192, above). His
                                conclusions with regard to Blake’s political vision in 
<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> are these: “As a political
                                virtue, love overreaches the exclusivity of humanism . . . no tie to
                                a particular order of things weakens the bond of the Eternals to the
                                polity. The perpetual figuring motion of that public life seeks to
                                preserve no aim as it fulfills no scheme and is authorized by no
                                principle. The polity of Jerusalem is ‘figural’ in
                                that Blake declines to smash one idol by instituting another, but
                                instead draws the reader into the dynamics of perpetual figuring and
                                refiguring of social life” (142-43). See also #235,

                                perspective of both theological and linguistic concerns” in
                                what is a considerably revised version of the author’s 1983
                                dissertation (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 18[1984-85]: 105 [#107]).
                                The chapters on the <hi rend="i">Pearl</hi> poet, Herbert, and Blake
                                are framed by an “Introduction” (1-26), the
                                “Conclusion: Toward the End of the Image” (177-200),
                                and an “Epilogue” (201-02) which serve to carry the
                                author’s argument “beyond poetry and into . . . other
                                matters,” that is into theology as applied to the
                                “larger concerns of our culture” (ix). Thorpe’s
                                aim is to demonstrate that each of the three poets discussed
                                “grounds his own poetics in an understanding of figurative
                                language drawn from the New Testament parables: the language of
                                Jesus,” and he wants “to use these writers as a means
                                of exploring the relationship between language and the world,
                                between body and spirit, and . . . the nature of what we call
                                labor” (2). Chapter 4 is “Razing <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>: Blake’s
Word as World” (123-175).
                                It asks for the function and functioning of the word (and the
                                “Word”) as metaphor, as symbol,
                                and—finally—as the “world” in
                                Blake’s epic. The answers are made somewhat easier by
                                Thorpe’s identification of the author with Los (see, e.g.,
                                126 or 157). In the author’s Christian perspective
                                “Blake’s mental warfare works with and within the
                                world of images, revealing that what we see ‘around’
                                us is not simply out there but also in here. It is neither out nor
                                in for Blake: it is simply here and now” (127). Such a
                                statement may, in the light of much recent research, seem an
                                oversimplification which by means of an equation evades more than
                                one important critical crux inherent in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi>
                                Moreover, and depending on one’s understanding of the term
                                “poetic,” one may feel tempted to yield to some
                                heretical distrust when being told that “‘To build the
                                Universe’ for Blake is nothing but a poetic act, as 
<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> sets out to 
<pb id="p26-109" n="109"/>
                                demonstrate” (131). Fortunately though, Thorpe’s idea
                                concerning the word as world in Blake is not entirely blind to
                                “what we see ‘around’ us.” For example,
                                his interpretation of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> does include
                                references to such (outer-) <corr type="emend">worldly</corr> phenomena as money and economy,
                                or alienated and unalienated labor, which he treats as part of
                                Blake’s theme in the epic (158-62). To write about 
<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> primarily as the work of a <hi rend="i">religious</hi> poet may all too easily have
led to some crude
                                distortions; this, I feel, is not the case in Thorpe’s
                                cautiously argued book. Occasionally, I found some of the religious
                                and/or theological overtones in <hi rend="i">New Earth</hi> rather
                                distracting; on the whole, however, the author’s definition
                                of the religious poet guarantees that even the heathen may at least
                                argue with Thorpe’s brand of liberal theology and the
                                perspective it supplies for a reading of Blake’s words and
                                worlds. Religious poets here are not identified as those who seek
                                “to express the inexpressible,” but as the poets who
                                “reveal that whatever we know of the
                                ‘ineffable’ is known precisely in our own labor, which
                                is inevitably rooted in a concrete here and now” (5). Would
                                Blake have enlisted?</p>

              <p>—The author reexamines the relation between word and image in
                                Blake, and “the power of words to control passionate
                                utterance” (125). Tolley draws his examples from
                                Blake’s illustrations of the Bible, of Shakespeare, Milton,
                                and Young, and he refers to Fuseli’s
                                “Nightmare” composition and Darwin’s <hi rend="i">Botanic Garden</hi> in
a comparison (139-41). His
                                understanding of Blake’s “literalism” in the
                                use of his sources often appears to be related to recent trends in
                                the reinterpretation of the Dante watercolors (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 23

                                [#186]). The methodology for interpreting Blake’s images that
                                is here described, and the cautious yet explicit retreat from the
                                position of the late Albert Roe (who suggested “that Blake
                                was always and only illustrating himself” [134]), also supply
                                what I believe to be a very promising approach for John E.

              <p>—Because “Blake’s poetry and myth lack a centre
                                or minimal element that can serve as the starting-point for linear
                                analysis,” the author thought it necessary to “use
                                notions developed by chaos theory, particularly self-similarity and
                                fractals, to explain the dynamic nature and structure of Eternity
                                and Blake’s poetry.” Doing so, what did he find?
                                “In his visionary poetry, . . . Blake sets the parameters for
                                a mythic field of infinite potential that is realized in the act of
                                reading. If the reader enters this field,” she or he is said
                                “to recreate Eternity out of a reductive, passive, and linear
                                Generation.” It is the “Eternals’ conversations
                                [in ‘Visionary forms dramatic’ that] constitute the
                                dynamic interaction between Eternity and Generation, and Eternity is
                                the continuous act of identifying the human forms in what the Fall
                                reduces to physical objects. This identification is realized in the
                                reader’s interaction with the text, and man’s
                                interactions with the world.”</p>

                                presents an account of the tradition that Blake was working in when
                                creating his Dante illustrations, briefly comments on
                                Fuseli’s and Flaxman’s Dante drawings, examines
                                Blake’s verbal commentaries on Dante (and his translator
                                Boyd), and then (72-128) interprets five of the watercolors in great
                                detail (“Dante Running from the Three Beasts,”
                                “The Mission of Virgil,” “Agnolo Brunelleschi

                                special attention is being paid to the varying degree of textual
                                referentiality that marks Blake’s visual
                                “translations” of Dante’s epic. Widauer
                                summarizes the results of her exemplary analyses by addressing

              <p>—Though this is not evident from its title, this slim volume
                                is as much an edition as it is a critical study, and it offers very
                                good value for money indeed. Readers are here supplied with
                                black-and-white reproductions of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi>,
                                copy G, and of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi>,

                                text of these poems interleaved with the plates (8-45). The
                                remaining pages are devoted to a critical examination of the two
                                books and form the monograph proper. Following an introduction in
                                which he confronts his readers with some key “Issues”
                                concerning the two texts and (to a limited extent) the illuminations
                                that accompany them (47-51), Wilkie discusses “Relationships
                                and Modes” (52-57), asks for “Correspondences”
                                (58-62), examines the heroines’ “Role and
                                Identity” (63-65), and observes “Metamorphoses”
                                (66-72); he then treats the themes of “Sexuality”
                                (73-84) and of “Mother, Child, Wife” (85-88) in both
                                poems, studies their “Symbiosis” (89-96), and
                                concludes with a set of “Interferences” (97-104) from
                                the preceding chapters. The study of Blake’s heroines has
                                recently gained new momentum, and Wilkie’s book participates
                                in this reevaluation of <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> and 
<hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion.</hi> As yet, no new
                                consensus has been reached, readings that attribute a feminist or an
                                anti-feminist stance to these texts compete with each other, and
                                occasionally the interpretative antagonisms appear to be rooted in
                                and to be addressing different positions in present-day gender
                                politics rather than Blake’s words or pictures. Also, where
                                James King (see #147, above) smells perversion, Wilkie may attribute
                                to Blake an “almost <corr type="emend">unparalleled</corr> sensitivity to the beauty of
                                the sexual act” (49). On the whole, this new monograph
                                successfully questions many elements of various accepted
                                “model readings” of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> and <hi rend="i">Visions.</hi>
Wilkie’s explication clearly shows
                                how limited the interpretative value of the “threefold model
                                of progress from Innocence through Experience to a higher
                                Innocence” or “the assumption that a fall from
                                Innocence to Experience is always a fortunate one” (97)
                                really is, and he uses the “principle of simultaneity”
                                to reinvest the two heroines with “a complexity of
                                psychological dynamics that makes them more fully human”
                                (98). He also forcefully argues that “to see [Blake’s
                                variations over a given theme] as sequential corrections of
                                himself” can sometimes result in what is “almost
                                surely an error.” This much granted, such an insight surely
                                cannot be treated as a general rule, applicable to Blake’s
                                “total work.” In the poet’s manuscript drafts
                                and in the artist’s prints and drawings one does encounter
                                “variations” that clearly are such “sequential
                                corrections” of earlier and experimental solutions to a given
                                artistic problem. Wilkie’s idea of “Blake’s
                                view of his total work . . . as a vast, ongoing, organic dialogue of
                                Blake with himself, in which no piece of his spiritual history was
                                ever simply discarded” (99), i.e., his own dynamic version of
                                Frye’s more static model of “cycles,” therefore
                                tends to be slightly simplistic and one-sided, too. It does not
                                allow enough room for the history of both writing and reading, or
                                for the questions posed by the response of contemporary readers of
                                Blake (if there really were any). Much better then to end this note
                                with the author’s appeal in which he states that the
                                “greatest challenge in reading <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> and 
<hi rend="i">Visions</hi> . . . is to do justice to [Blake’s]
                                openmindedness . . . without sentimentalizing him, without foolishly
                                attempting to dilute the passion (including the anger) of his
                                prophetic

              <p>—“The present state of Blake criticism can be said to
                                resemble, as it has for several decades past, a state of
                                war.” Williams finds that “this war is between . . .
                                those who would indicate [Blake’s] participation in a largely
                                intellectual prophetic or philosophic tradition and those who would
                                identify his poetry’s determination by its material and
                                social conditions. The thesis of ideology and utopia . . . provides
                                the framework for an attempt to articulate this battle between
                                Blake’s interpreters.” Therefore, the author
                                “considers several contemporary parallels for Blake’s
                                ideas of both a theory of ideology and a theory of utopia: Mary
                                Wollstonecraft, Edmund Burke, Thomas Paine and Robert Owen. In a
                                chronological survey of the entire corpus [of his writings] . . .
                                the evolution of Blake’s utopianism and its relation to a
                                variously universalized or particularized concept of ideology is
                                considered at length.” Williams thus examines
                                “Blake’s desire for an extraideological
                                ‘nowhere’” and “his despair in the face
                                of an inescapable ideology . . . with an eye towards providing
                                models of interpretation which are not merely negative, but which
                                also acknowledge the positive, properly utopian energy at work in
                                the literary text.” This dissertation, then, touches on some
                                of the same issues that have recently been discussed in the work of
                                James Swearingen (see #223-25, above).</p>

              <p>—“The Bible is unquestionably the one text Blake knew
                                and studied most deeply. In this dissertation, I examine
                                Blake’s unorthodox and inventive methods of incorporating
                                Biblical allusions and tropes into his late prophetic poems, <hi rend="i">The
Four Zoas, Milton</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi>” In an attempt to continue the work
                                begun by Leslie Tannenbaum, the author first “presents a
                                historical overview of the hermeneutic tradition to which Blake was
                                likely exposed,” and finds that “Blake develops what I
                                call a ‘contrary hermeneutic,’ . . . that . . . avoids
                                allegory’s abstractions, subverts the hermeneutic closure and
                                historical determinism of typology, and rejects rabbinic
                                legalism.” In <hi rend="i">Vala, or The Four Zoas</hi> Yogev
                                sees “a critique of John’s apocalypse itself,”
                                in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> an “activist view of the
                                individual’s task of reforming the world,” and as its
                                “key metaphor . . . Jacob’s struggle with the
                                angel.” He then addresses, in his concluding chapter,
                                “the Minute Particulars of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>,” which
“reveal” to him
                                “how Scripture conditions Blake’s artistic and ethical
                                vision on the most literal level.” For a related study of
                                Blake’s use of biblical typology turn to #163, and for

                            “amateur” publisher, and he gives a full bibliographical
                            description of the resulting publications. Whereas Blake was not
                            employed by Du Roveray, other artists from his circle were; these
                            include Fuseli, Sharp, Stothard, Cromek, Schiavonetti, and Parker.
                            Drawing on mostly unpublished manuscript sources, Bentley presents a
                            vivid picture of the entire production process for the books and
                            engravings that were issued with the Du Roveray imprint. Even though Du
                            Roveray’s “amateur” involvement in the publishing
                            trade is in some ways untypical of the period, this case study is highly
                            recommended. The suite of all four articles has been briefly noted by

            <p>—This publication accompanied a most interesting exhibition at
                            University Art Gallery in Nottingham (30 Apr.-31 May) and at Kenwood
                            House (19 June-31 Aug. 1991). The catalogue discusses works by many of
                            the artists that Blake admired and/or was acquainted with: Mortimer
                            (#11, 47, 65), Barry (#24, 58), Schiavonetti (#29; after West),
                            Kauffmann (#34), Moser (#46), Romney (#59), Fuseli (#60a-b), and Flaxman
                            (#82, 88). Blake himself was represented in the show with an academy
                            study that is traditionally attributed to him and dated c. 1780 (#27).
                            Bignamini’s commentary in no way questions this attribution of a
                            “Naked Youth, Seen from the Side” to Blake, but yields to
                            the temptation to interpret the chalk drawing as “an act of
                            rebellion against the Academy, its educational principles and its
                            orthodox approach to the living model” (57), a temptation that
                            stems, of course, from Blake’s marginalia to Reynolds’s
                                <hi rend="i">Discourses</hi>, written almost 30 years after he had
                            first entered the Academy Schools. Though I find it hard to follow (the
                            chronology of) such reasoning, the catalogue as a whole makes an
                            important contribution to a better understanding of the various possible
                            approaches to the human form (profane) in Blake’s times. All the
                            exhibits are illustrated in black and white, and there are 18 color
                            plates. See the subsequent entries for closely related studies.</p>

            <p>—Based on the author’s Ph.D. thesis (Courtauld Institute of
                            Art, U of London, 1988), this article chronicles the London art world of
                            Blake’s youth. There are even a few passing references to
                            Blake’s critique of Reynolds’s <hi rend="i">Discourses</hi> (178-80). The
article presents an intelligent,
                            useful, and well-informed account of the prehistory of the Royal Academy
                            and of the rise and establishment of a new art buying public in
                            mid-eighteenth-century Britain. One is surprised, however, by
                            Bignamini’s seeming unawareness of the wealth of pertinent
                            information supplied in Johannes Dobai’s <hi rend="i">Kunstliteratur des
Klassizismus und der Romantik in England</hi> of
                            1974-84. (The absence of this publication from the notes to the present

            <p>—Whereas Blake, in this second volume of Boime’s
                            “Social History of Modern Art,” is mentioned only in
                            passing, Erasmus Darwin and his influence (not only in Britain, but also
                            on German romanticism), the works of Fuseli, Flaxman, and West are all
                            discussed at some length. There is a long chapter on “English Art
                            in the Napoleonic Era” (97-197), with sections on
                            “West’s <hi rend="i">Lord Nelson</hi>” (106-08),
                            much on Turner and Constable, and discussions of the patronage of
                            Beckford (127-35) and “The Earl of Egremont” (153-59).
                            Fuseli is treated as part of “The English Connection”
                            (263-64) in Spanish culture of the period, and “Darwin’s
                            Theory of Dreams” (272-73), as well as “Fuseli’s
                                <hi rend="i">Nightmare</hi> and Goya’s <hi rend="i">Capricho
                                43</hi>” (273-74), are made to contribute to an understanding
                            of Goya’s iconography. Friedrich Perthes, who published Crabb
                            Robinson’s account of Blake’s art and poetry in 1811, is
                            subject of another short section of the book (385-86 and

                            (50), Flaxman (101), Fuseli (106-08), Kauffmann (169-70), Linnell (197),

                            Stothard (303), Varley (325), and West (336-37). Despite the usual
                            simplifications, these notes are generally competent and reliable,
                            though Blake is said to have abandoned “toute politique
                            après la Terreur” (35), and to have written <hi rend="i">The French
Revolution</hi> “en prose” (36). The
                            volume is illustrated in color, yet comes without a general bibliography
                            and, more importantly, supplies no guidance whatsoever to the literature
                            on the artists or movements treated in the entries. It almost goes
                            without saying then that in comparison with the Larousse

                            June 1991). There is an introduction by Martin Butlin (7-8), followed by
                            short essays authored by Martin Postle, David Alexander, and Geoffrey
                            Ashton on Hogarth and Reynolds (9-13), on epic representation in

            <p>—At the very center of Essick’s contribution to the Wark
                                <hi rend="i">festschrift</hi> is an examination of text-design
                            relationships in book illustrations executed by Blake after the designs
                            of Stothard and Fuseli. Enlarging on some of the issues discussed in the
                            introductory study to his catalogue raisonné of Blake’s
                            commercial engravings (see #24, above), these visual-verbal structures
                            are here compared with examples from Blake’s “composite

                            also treats the work of Beardsley fairly extensively (194-99). See also
                            #45, 77-78, 165, and 168, above. The same collection of essays contains

                            (125-43). This article, though not directly concerned with the works of
                            Blake and the artists of his “circle,” may nevertheless be
                            interesting for the study of the artist-poet’s political

                            1992). Among the introductory essays one finds Peter Funnell’s
                            “Die Londoner Kunstwelt und ihre Institutionen” (155-166;
                            see also #242, above), Andrew Wilton’s account of “Die
                            Malerei im London des frühen neunzehnten Jahrhunderts”
                            (167-86), and Marilyn Butler’s “Die verschwiegene

                            writings on 190 and 197-98). More than 700 exhibits were assembled in
                            order to reconstruct life in the metropolis during the first half of the
                            nineteenth century and are here catalogued. They included Rees’s

                            this are almost always bound to leave their visitors dazed and confused.
                            In order to attract a large public as their “consumers,”
                            they tend to focus on historical “Power and Splendor,”
                            rather than on strife and conflict. Therefore, they may often supply an
                            overwhelming, but rarely ever

            <p>—Once more, Blake and his circle were well represented in a major
                            exhibition that was held under the auspices of the Council of Europe at
                            the Bernisches Historisches Museum and the Kunstmuseum Bern (1 June-15.
                            Sept. 1991), and which was intended to pay homage to Switzerland as
                            Europe’s eldest republic. The theme for the entire exhibition was
                            set by Fuseli’s “Oath on the Rütli,” a
                            composition here seen in two drawings, an oil sketch, and in the
                            finished version (#1-4). Fuseli’s “Tell” and some
                            of his drawings were shown as examples of the new interest in republican
                            imagery evolving in the wake of the American and French Revolutions
                            (#63-64 and #292-95). Two separate sections were devoted to the
                            iconography of these major events in eighteenth-century history (#317-24
                            and #325-38, with an unfinished painting by Benjamin West as #321).
                            Blake himself was represented with six pages from the Cunliffe-Glasgow
                            copy B of <hi rend="i">Europe: a Prophecy</hi> (#296a-f), for which
                            Martin Butlin wrote the catalogue entries (466-70). The handy catalogue
                            for the somewhat fuzzy exhibition offers an introduction to no less than
                            five centuries of “republican” art; it was also issued in
                            a French-language edition by the same publishers.</p>
            <p>252. Gaull, Marilyn. “Coleridge and the Kingdoms of the
                            World.” <hi rend="i">Wordsworth Circle</hi> 22 (1991): 47-52.</p>
            <p>—Gaull treats the connections between poetry and the natural
                            sciences of the 1790s and supplies almost as many references to Blake as
                            to Coleridge. The scientific “kingdoms of the world,” she
                            argues, “are compelling and illuminating subtexts which require
                            only our familiarity with them to become useful intrepretive
                            devices” (49) for an understanding of poetry, the visual arts,
                            and almost anything else in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century
                            cultural history. I strongly believe that the author is right here, and
                            yet one problem remains: if taken seriously, it is not quite so easy as
                            Gaull appears to imply to develop any genuine
                            “familiarity” with late eighteenth-century
                            “geology, astronomy, anatomy, and biology” (47) all at the
                            same time. Furthermore, and having done a little home work in this field
                            myself, I seriously doubt the “aid to reflection” supplied
                            by glosses which, for example, merely characterize Sir William
                            Herschel’s contribution to the history of astronomy by reference
                            to his “explosive, dynamic, evolving, asymmetrical, boundless
                            universe,” which is said to have “reflected the political
                            realities of revolutionary Europe,” and which was
                            “amenable to the poetic and artistic imagination” (48). As
                            long as one shuns the discussion of the processes of transmission
                            between the workings of the scientific and the artistic imagination,
                            this must needs remain an impressionistic sketch made up of parallels
                            without the firmly drawn connecting lines that I think are vital where
                            it comes to the forging of an interpretative device.</p>

              <p>—The author attributes to Barry three “landscape
                                drawings and the fragment of a fourth . . ., all evidently belonging
                                to a group of sketches made on a journey from Rome to Naples in
                                1769.” These sketchbook “‘memorials’ of
                                the landscape through which he passed” (307) were tracked
                                down in the collections of the Fitzwilliam Museum and the Yale

              <p>—A fascinating account of botanical writing during the 1790s
                                and its social applications; Bewell, after describing the
                                “success of Linnaeus’ Sexual System of Plants”
                                (133) and its consequences, turns to Darwin’s <hi rend="i">Loves of the

                                that for Darwin “the patriarchal family was not a universal
                                human institution, that other societies had developed alternate
                                arrangements” (135), and that, second, “the
                                horticultural discourse on luxuriants could easily be adapted to
                                social critique” (138). Bewell also examines

                                of the 24th International Congress in the History of Art, organized
                                by the C.I.H.A. at Bologna, 10-18 Sept. 1979. Glenn concentrates on
                                the use of copies from Flaxman’s compositions in

              <p>—The article examines the idea (and the ideology) of the
                                historical “progress” of the arts that underlies
                                Flaxman’s <hi rend="i">Lectures on Sculpture, as Delivered
                                    before the President and Members of the Royal Academy</hi>
                                (first published in 1828). Drawing on related sources (such as the
                                lectures and discourses delivered at the Royal Academy by Reynolds,
                                Barry, Fuseli, and Opie), and on recent critical contributions to
                                the study of British art theory of the late eighteenth century
                                (particularly those of Barrell and Eaves), the author attempts to
                                demonstrate that Flaxman’s account of Italian seventeenth-
                                and British eighteenth-century sculpture, despite its seeming
                                topicality, was guided by a rather peculiar model of the historical
                                “development” of the arts. According to this sub-text
                                of the sculptor’s lectures, the historical <hi rend="i">telos</hi> of
British art around 1800 was a new
                                “renaissance,” inaugurated at the Royal Academy, and
                                in tune with the idea (and the ideology) of a “Britannia

              <p>—McAvera draws attention to the relation between the visual

                                inspired by Joyce’s <hi rend="i">Ulysses</hi>, and then

                                associated, the Moores. Inscribed inside the cover of the album in
                                which these drawings were mounted is the name ‘Harriet Jane
                                Moore’” [8]. Harriet Moore was also the recipient of
                                copy E of Blake’s <hi rend="i">For Children</hi> (presented
                                to her by Fuseli in 1806) and the owner of various other works by
                                Fuseli, including the so-called Roman Album. Unlike this album,
                                which is preserved in the British Museum Print Room, the newly
                                rediscovered series of drawings was broken up into 57 lots for the
                                sale. Most of the items that are here expertly described by Butlin
                                fetched prices near or well above the higher estimates during the
                                sale on 14 Apr. 1992; the success of the sale exemplified, again,
                                the high esteem in which Fuseli’s sketches and studies,
                                rather than his finished paintings, are held by twentieth-century
                                curators and collectors. (Some of the consequences of this
                                preference are addressed in the annotation to #281, below.) At least
                                until the publication of the English-language edition of Gert
                                Schiff’s catalogue raisonné of Fuseli’s works,
                                to be translated and fully revised by David Weinglass, the present
                                beautifully illustrated catalogue will remain indispensable for the
                                student of Fuseli’s style and iconography. However, on
                                account of the tight production schedule, and much to the distress
                                of the author, the auctioneers decided to entrust their own staff
                                rather than Butlin himself with the proofreading of the text. This
                                resulted in a couple of typographical errors: for
                                “Kaufmann” [7] read “Kauffmann”; it was
                                James rather than “John Moore” [8] who had died in
                                1809, who “was of considerable help” to Knowles when
                                the latter assembled information for his life of Fuseli; for
                                “James Weathercock,” an invention of Christie’s
                                copyeditor, read “Janus Weathercock” throughout;
                                moreover, the author now agrees with David Weinglass and the present

              <p>—This exhibition flyer was issued on the occasion of a
                                traveling exhibition organized by the American Federation of Arts in
                                association with the Auckland City Art Gallery. The Auckland Fuselis
                                were consecutively shown (during Nov. 1990-Nov. 1991) at the Frick
                                Art Museum, Pittsburgh, at the National Academy of Design, New York,
                                at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, and at the National Gallery of
                                Canada, Ottawa. The fold-out prospectus for the exhibition contains
                                an introduction by Tomory and a checklist of the 37 exhibits; four
                                of the drawings are reproduced. In the first paragraph the author
                                recapitulates his hypothesis concerning the Blakean provenance of
                                the large group of Fuseli’s drawings that was acquired by the
                                Auckland museum in 1965. Since 1979 (when Tomory had first suggested
                                “that the recipient” of these drawings, chosen by
                                Fuseli “as gifts for another artist . . . could have been
                                William Blake”) this hypothesis has not precisely gained in
                                credibility, and in the present brochure no new “internal and
                                external evidence” that might buttress Tomory’s claim
                                is brought forward.</p>

                                Vaterland die Fremde werden?’: In der Emigration: Johann
                                Heinrich Füssli.” <hi rend="i">Neue Zürcher

              <p>—This study confronts Henry Fuseli, the British Royal
                                Academician, with Johann Heinrich Füssli, his Swiss
                                alter-ego. David Weinglass describes the painter’s ambivalent
                                relationship with the country he had left behind in order to embark
                                on a career, first as a man of letters, and then as one of the most
                                influential figures of the London art world during Blake’s
                                times. The drawings after Swiss mannerist book illustrations that
                                Fuseli executed in his youth at Zurich and his treatment of subjects
                                from Swiss history are here set off against his Italian and British
                                drawings and the paintings executed for the “Milton
                                Gallery.” The essay very usefully raises a couple of
                                questions of primary importance for the direction Fuseli studies
                                will take in the future. Weinglass clearly ranks Fuseli’s
                                drawings much higher than the paintings, and he stresses this point
                                just as other commentators and collectors, ever since the
                                “rediscovery” of the artist in the 1920s, have done
                                before him. While there is much that could be said in favor of such
                                an evaluation by the modern connoisseur, it is hard to believe that
                                Fuseli himself would have subscribed without some hesitation to such
                                a reversal in the hierarchy of the means, genres, and economics of
                                artistic expression. Similarly, if Haydon’s frenzied and
                                thoroughly biased account of Fuseli’s painting technique
                                continues to be uncritically paraphrased time and again (see 67,
                                third column), there is little chance to even think about the
                                possible suitability of the artist’s peculiar handling of
                                color for his choice of subject matter. Also, as long as the study
                                of Fuseli (and David Weinglass is unquestionably one of its leading
                                authorities) accepts the superiority of the artist’s drawings
                                over his paintings as a presupposition that is not to be questioned,
                                it is bound to stress the personal rather than the public dimensions
                                of his works. In addition, Fuseli’s oils are technically not
                                much worse than those of, say, Reynolds (or Blake’s early
                                temperas for that matter), a point that is lacking from
                                Weinglass’s account. Whateverthe quality of Fuseli’s
                                technical training and its deficiencies, he put them to good use. It
                                is a simple fact, I think, that the awesome void one is staring at
                                in a painting such as “Sin Pursued by Death” (Zurich,
                                Kunsthaus)—and that stares back from it—is as much the
                                material result of Fuseli’s dry brushstrokes, of his
                                “dead” coloring, as of the shapes he gives to his
                                figures, or the acts he shows them involved in. And it is this void
                                which first creates that peculiar feeling of mystery in front of a
                                Fuseli painting, which then distinguishes the viewer’s
                                emotional response to Fuseli’s idea of “Milton”
                                from a response to any other painter’s. The
                                “deadened” pigments and the color black in his
                                paintings thus heighten, not diminish, an effect that can also be
                                observed in Fuseli’s drawings. Both function as a painterly
                                device that increases the impact that is created when figures inside
                                a composition see (and know) more than the viewer is allowed to see
                                (and know) while looking at them. Therefore, I should like to argue
                                that in Fuseli, as in Blake, color and its compositional treatment
                                manifestly contribute to the specific <hi rend="i">meaning</hi> of a
                                painting, and that such meaning and its compelling power to evoke
                                responses from the viewers cannot sufficiently be described in terms
                                of iconographic identifications alone. These are general problems of
                                interpretation which, however, qualify as issues for further debate
                                in coming years. Finally, I would like to point out that in the
                                anonymous German translation the present text is not always easy to
                                comprehend; furthermore, the translation represents a considerably
                                shortened version of the original text (kindly made available to me
                                by the author), and it does not always do justice to its ideas.

              <p>—It is the purpose of this critical and fully annotated
                                edition of <hi rend="i">Caleb Williams</hi> to establish Godwin
                                “as a fascinating ‘transitional’ writer in the
                                shift from ‘Enlightenment’ to
                                ‘Romanticism’ thinking.” Hindle sees the
                                “key importance” of this “transitional text . .
                                . in the way it registers the problems occurring at that moment in
                                European history and thought, . . . [that] Foucault has termed the
                                ‘threshold of modernity.’ The material presented with
                                the novel text offers evidence of how Godwin comes to be situated at
                                this threshold and discusses the various determinations which bring
                                this about. Thus the Chronology and Chapters One to Five of the
                                Critical Introduction treat the historical, political, religious and
                                psychological factors materially bearing Godwin towards the
                                production of the novel. . . . The Bibliography of <hi rend="i">Caleb
Williams</hi> illustrates a widespread consumption of the
                                novel over time and space, suggesting that the ‘divided
                                mind’ which the book makes available to its
                                psychologically-minded audience has been

              <p>—Bock studies two mythological paintings that were executed by
                                Kauffmann and sold in 1782 to the collector George Bowles, and that
                                have more recently been acquired for the small collection of British
                                paintings at the Gemäldegalerie Berlin. The author examines
                                their iconography (Montesquieu’s story of Cephisa and her
                                lover clipping the wings of Cupid) in the context of the

              <p>—Rosenthal studies the iconography of a group of
                                Kauffmann’s paintings and drawings. “The article sets
                                out to disclose in the work of Angelica Kauffman commentaries upon
                                the dominant ideologies of sexual difference active in the
                                eighteenth century,” and it demonstrates how the artist
                                “specifically thematizes and criticizes prevailing social
                                constructions of women and femininity.” The hidden meaning
                                that the author finds is here read as a commentary on the
                                handicapped situation of the female artist in late
                                eighteenth-century London (as elsewhere), and as Kauffmann’s
                                “claims” for full professional recognition of female
                                artists. Of course, such “claims could not avoid
                                marginalization, unless couched in a manner palatable to dominant
                                taste. Consequently, statements such as Kauffman’s cannot be
                                decoded unless tied to the male centred eighteenth-century discourse
                                which defined the role of women in society,” and which was
                                linked “to the rapidly evolving economies of trade and
                                class” (38). After sketching the outlines of these historical
                                changes (39-41), Rosenthal turns to a detailed examination of two of
                                Kauffmann’s works that address central issues in art theory
                                and, “hidden in the recesses of [such] traditional
                                iconographies,” are simultaneously concerned with the
                                “claims to intellectual and professional rights” for
                                women (41). Kauffmann is here seen as joining “other female
                                intellectuals in criticizing the confining aspects of sensibility. .
                                . . she reconstructs a scene of female intellect, while still
                                retaining qualities of emotionality. In this respect she is thus
                                less radical in her thinking than Wollstonecraft, for example, who
                                actively sought to erase the category of the sensible. The
                                compromise made by Kauffman fairly sums up her [more] pragmatic
                                approach: combining an ideological fidelity to a differentiated and
                                positive notion of female sexual identity, and an unwillingness to
                                sacrifice professional success. The disclosure of the masking
                                dynamic . . . helps to define these imperatives” (54). Though
                                Rosenthal’s reading of the visual evidence variously
                                contradicts and/or tellingly supplements that of Baumgärtel
                                (see, e.g., 48, 51, and n46, 60), the latter’s book
                                nevertheless supplies some general context for the article of the
                                former; see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 25 (1991-92): 40 (#269).</p>

              <p>—This brief note has been occasioned by the discovery of an
                                entry in “the record books of the Hambledon Cricket
                                Club” which reveals “that Tom Paine was present at the
                                meeting of 28 August 1796.” The possibility “that the
                                entry in the minute book may be ‘a prank’” (7)
                                is mentioned by Simons. He seems convinced, however, “that

                                joke—more about Paine’s itinerary on his journey from
                                France to the States, or more about revolutionary affinities in a

              <p>—Thomas briefly comments on Blake and Paine (169-70, 172), and
                                he reports (without questioning the evidence) that it was Blake who
                                “warned Paine of his impending arrest and helped him flee the

                                (24 Jan.-14 Mar. 1992). It contains brief notes on “The Life
                                of Samuel Palmer” (1-2; with the two obligatory paragraphs on
                                Blake, Palmer and the Ancients) and “Palmer the
                                Etcher” (5), plus catalogue entries for the 29 items on show
                                (6-15), an illustrated “Glossary of Technical Terms”
                                (16), and a “Bibliographical Note” (19). Nine prints
                                are reproduced at the actual size of the original plates. The
                                exhibits included the disputed monotype of a “Landscape with
                                Ploughman” (#16) and the four canceled, but recently restored

                                the “questionable behaviour of the Blake Trust” in
                                what he claims to be the “unauthorized” (945) use of
                                36 restrikes from Palmer’s “Lonely Tower”

                                held at Leger’s (24 June-24 July 1992) is a tribute to Harold
                                Leger’s personal interest in Palmer’s work, an
                                enthusiasm that, according to David Posnett’s preface,
                                “brought this gallery a little too near to the Palmeresque in
                                the 1970s” [v]. Lister contributes an essay on “Samuel

                                tradition in general on the Italian Renaissance, Yeats, and Blake
                                (15-16). It must be for this reason that the latter’s
                                Arlington Court tempera is reproduced as a frontispiece to the
                                booklet and sets the the tone for Taylor’s 1789-92
                                translation of “this most beautiful and profound
                                treatise” (12) of the third century. The life, acquaintances,
                                and reputation of the translator are outlined on 16-19.
                                Unfortunately, there is no identification in this volume of the
                                edition of Taylor’s <hi rend="i">History of the Restoration
                                    of the Platonic Theology</hi>, or of his <hi rend="i">Commentaries of
Proclus</hi> (1789), from which the translation
                                of Porphyry’s text is here cited (25-56). Also, upon
                                comparing the present version of Taylor’s “Concerning
                                the Cave of the Nymphs” with the text of his translation of
                                Porphyry as printed in <hi rend="i">Thomas Taylor the Platonist:

                                to find major discrepancies between the two editions in the phrasing
                                of both the text and (especially) Taylor’s notes (57-70). The
                                Phanes Press edition may have been taken from a heavily edited later
                                version of the original translation, or it may by itself represent
                                the result of some recent, but silent ‘modernization.’

              <p>—Just as one should have guessed from the title of this

                                Wollstonecraft, Mary Hays, Helen Maria Williams, Elizabeth Inchbald
                                and Charlotte Smith,” the author has
                                “deliberately” chosen “five women writers who
                                were radicals of the 1790s in their own ways. . . . All five saw the
                                need for change in society; they became the advocates for reform,
                                stressing, in particular, the requirement for amelioration of the
                                women’s condition. My thesis points out exactly to which
                                aspects of the patriarchal establishment these authors
                                objected.” Furthermore, it “shows that while their
                                fictional works seem to be couched in the language of love and
                                sensibility, the women nevertheless revise and deconstruct the
                                essentially male-structured traditional novel.” “Most
                                significantly,” though this may not come as too much of a
                                surprise, Ty argues “that these works articulated the female
                                consciousness, perhaps for the first time in novel form. . . . By
                                allowing the female voice to enter into male discourse, these
                                fictions undermine the phallocentric monopoly of power and control
                                of language. Consequently, the transparency of the meaning of words
                                such as virtue, chastity, happiness, love is questioned. These
                                crucial words acquire new signification, embodying specifically
                                female vision and desire.”</p>

            <p>—S. Foster Damon, back in 1924, drew attention to what he felt was
                            a striking “correspondence of the Job engravings to the Tarot
                            cards” (<hi rend="i">William Blake: His Philosophy and
                                Symbols</hi> [1924; London: Dawsons, 1969] 237), and many readers
                            will remember having seen a Tarot version of “The
                            Fool”—complete with dog, cliff, and all—that looks
                            as if in turn it had been modeled on Blake’s design and engraving
                            of “The Dog” for Hayley’s 1805 <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (this version has
recently been reproduced in
                            Robinson’s <hi rend="i">The Walk</hi> [120]; see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 25
[1991-92]: 29 [#168]). It almost comes as a surprise
                            then that it took all these years 
<pb id="p26-119" n="119"/>
until a
                            Tarot deck with Blake’s images was devised. Buryn employs the
                            marginal designs of the <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings (here printed
                            in red) for his deck of cards, and he replaces the original <hi rend="i">Job</hi>
images with a selection from Blake’s commercial
                            engravings (after Fuseli), separate plates, relief etchings,
                            colorprints, and watercolors (all printed in blue and partly redrawn).
                            However, despite Mary K. Greer’s claims to the contrary on the
                            back cover of the present publication, the result turns out to be an
                            awfully ugly “work of collage art derived from the works of
                            William Blake,” of which, in my view, the engraver would <hi rend="i">not</hi>
have “heartily approve[d],” and that
                            can hardly be said to offer “an essential experience for . . .
                            Blake aficionados.” Still, Buryn’s deck of cards and his
                            accompanying “Interpretive Book” (of 16 pages, the title
                            included) are entitled to claim at least one “Triumph”:
                            unquestionably they may rank as the weirdest Blake curiosity recorded in
                            the present checklist. See also the “Newsletter”

            <p>—Though in this obituary Butlin justly emphasizes that
                            “Schiff was no narrow specialist,” he is here
                            concentrating on the scholar’s writings on Fuseli rather than on
                            his books and exhibition catalogues concerned with modern art and
                            artists. Butlin laments that at the date of Gert Schiff’s
                            premature death, the German-American scholar had with his Tokyo
                            exhibition catalogue only just embarked upon what promised to develop
                            into a major contribution to art historical Blake studies: “a
                            rich vein of new material and ideas” that is as yet, and
                            unfortunately so, “concealed in the obscurity, to most of us,

            <p>—The introductory chapter to this collection is Frye’s own
                            “Auguries of Experience,” which begins with a reminiscence
                            of “days so remote I can barely remember them now.” Frye
                            was then “reading books on Blake in preparation for writing one
                            [him]self. In these early times it was an unquestionable axiom that one
                            should read everything available on a subject before trying to write
                            about it, and for Blake in the thirties that was still humanly possible.
                            So [he] immersed [him]self in the two or three good books and the
                            hundred and fifty or so bad ones that had been devoted to Blake up to
                            that time” (1). One wonders what the author of <hi rend="i">Fearful
Symmetry</hi> would have thought of the harvest recorded in
                            the present list—how many good books and articles, and how many
                            more bad ones? Other Blake references in this relatively slim collection
                            of essays are indexed (157).</p>

            <p>—Here is a brand-new poem that ably “recaptures”
                            Blake’s tone (and irony?): “This hearing, Albion grieves,
                            and Oosa, malingering in the employee / Washroom, makes sad lament, not
                            for the bean but for the world / Within the bean, for all
                            Futurity” (6). In the same issue, readers may want to have a look

            <p>—A prolific scholar and certainly one of the most innovative
                            personalities in post-war art history, the former director of the
                            Hamburg Kunsthalle here looks back at more than two decades during which
                            he established new standards for what an art historical exhibition may
                            be (concerned with, asking of the works on show, and teaching its
                            visitors). Commenting on some of the more important acquisitions he was
                            able to make for Hamburg, he illustrates two paintings and a drawing by
                            Fuseli (37), another drawing by Romney (41), and three of the Blakes
                            bought for the Kunsthalle in 1976, 1980, and 1988 (38-39). A brief note
                            explaining his personal interest in Blake’s art accompanies the

                            (1991): 47-52.</p>
            <p>—In this essay (and its sequels) the author sets out to
                            “examine the reasons, avowed and implicit, for hostility to
                            science, [to] hazard a guess at some of the motives behind it, and point
                            out the dangers posed to the health and happiness of the planet when a
                            large section of the intelligentsia is ignorant of and hostile to
                            technology and science” (47). Blake and the English romantics are
                            discussed in this first installment. Part “(2): The Eunuch at the
                            Orgy” (17.4 [1991]: 48-51) is concerned with the literary (and
                            otherwise learned) critic who is entirely unawares “of the
                            particular facts, general laws and underlying mechanisms revealed by
                            science and exploited in technology” (48). Parts “(3):
                            ‘The Murderousness and Gadgetry of This Age’” (17.5
                            [1991]: 39-42) and “(4): Anti-Science and Organic
                            Daydreams” (17.6 [1991]: 31-39) examine “the
                            irrationality, the hypocrisy and the dangers of contemporary
                            technophobia” (part 3: 39). Though Blake probably would not have
                            approved of Tallis’s polemics, the Blake scholar is likely to
                            profit from an examination of his arguments. Readers who are at all
                            interested in the current dichotomy between science and the humanities
                            will also want to have a look at the ensuing discussion between Tallis
                            and a literary critic (see 18.1 [1991]: 36-42 and 42-45). Blake’s
                            “Newton” is very much in the foreground when Grevel Lindop
                            defends the “Romantics” and maintains that Tallis has got
                            them “quite wrong—could hardly, in fact, have got them
                            wronger” (36).</p>

          <p>Again, a couple of mostly minor corrections and additional annotations to
                        entries in previous issues of this annual report are called for. Having
                        either examined some of the items that had to be marked as “not
                        seen” in earlier lists, or having acquired additional information
                        from secondary sources which had not been available to me when first listing
                        the respective contributions to the scholarly literature concerned with
                        “Blake and His Circle,” I would like to draw attention to the
                        following notes:</p>
          <p>18#162: delete asterisk; the book was published as vol. 21 of “De
                        proprietatibus litterarum: series maior,” and the chapter entitled
                        “Introduction [to Part IV] and Blake” is on 333-56.</p>
          <p>#20#278: delete the asterisk; the book was first published in 1983 rather
                        than 1984, and it is still available in a 1985 impression.</p>
          <p>22#202: delete the asterisk; the name of the publishers is to read Haas, not
                        Staedlezo; this volume, issued in a limited edition of 1400 copies and
                        priced at DM228.00, will make a magnificent book for the proverbial coffee
                        table and/or a good companion for Baumgärtel’s fine, yet not
                        so finely illustrated monograph (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 25 [1990-91]:
                        40 [#269])—the briefest of introductions (10-19) is followed by some
                        fifty large-scale color reproductions of Kauffmann’s works, a larger
                        group of her paintings than has ever been reproduced in one book before.
                        22#358: in the book’s title, please correct the word <hi rend="i">Repercussions</hi>
which has been misspelled as
                        “repurcussions.”</p>
          <p>23#437(2): here comes an unusually stupid mistake; when typing the 1988-89
                        checklist, I must have been too tired for bibliographic work, or in a haste,
                        or both; therefore, I mingled together the reviews for two distinct
                        publications that are headed by the same author’s name; Roe’s
                        review is not concerned with the <hi rend="i">Essays in Romanticism</hi>,
                        edited by J. R. Watson, but with the same scholar’s introduction to
                            <hi rend="i">English Poetry of the Romantic Period</hi>; accordingly,
                        readers are asked to turn to #599(2), above, for the correct entry, and to
                        delete this Roe reference from the checklist for volume 23.</p>
          <p>25#10 and 15: delete asterisks. 25#38: add page references as 7-18. 25#40:
                        delete asterisk; insert the series title as “Analecta Husserliana
                        23”; the correct page references are 281-88. 25#95: delete asterisk;
                        “Through Forests of Eternal Death: Blake and Universal
                        History” is on 38-66. 25#134: delete asterisk; “Blake: The
                        Poetry of Violence” is on 157-205. 25#139, 154, 155, and 167: delete
                        asterisks; the collection of essays with Riede’s article (#167) was
                        first published as vol. 975 of the “University Paperbacks”
                        series in 1988, not 1987. 25#168: delete asterisk; though of only limited
                        interest to the hardboiled Blakean, Jeffrey Robinson has certainly succeeded
                        in laying out a most pleasant <hi rend="i">Walk</hi> through romanticism and
                        some of its modern connotations; Blake’s walker is pictured in the
                        streets of London on 103-04, his considerably enlarged traveler who
                        “hasteth 
<pb id="p26-129" n="129"/>
in the Evening,” serves as
                        a frontispiece illustration and, in the form of a vignette line drawing,
                        guides the way from one chapter to another. 25#170: delete asterisk. 25#182
                        and 504: delete asterisk; due to a typographical error in one of the
                        catalogues issued by the publishers, the book’s title was misquoted;
                        for <hi rend="i">Poetic Friend</hi> read <hi rend="i">Poetic Friends.</hi>
                        25#186: in the bracketed cross-reference to volume 23 of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>,
square brackets should have been used for the date of
                        publication. 25#195: here, the year of publication is 1989 rather than 1990;
                        also, Basingstoke, the first of the two places of publication that were
                        cited, is part of the county of Hampshire, not a place in Huntingdonshire;
                        hence, read “Hants.” for “Hunts.” 25#265: being
                        part of the book’s title, “Gothic” in <hi rend="i">Gothic Immortals</hi> ought

                        Mary Hays” (236-52). 25#310: delete asterisk and add a reference for

                        scholarly beginnings in a chapter that, quite appropriately, he has entitled

                        [1991-92]: 47-54) all the cross-references to items that were listed there
                        for the very first time call for revision. Though intended for publication
                        in volume 24, the previous checklist was in fact published as the first
                        number of volume 25 of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, this entails that all
                        cross-references in the style of “[24#000]” ought to read
                        “[25#000]” instead. However, and since there was no checklist
                        published as part of the journal’s 24th volume, it is hoped that this
                        “translation” of a reference such as “24#134”
                        into “25#134” will not cause any major confusion.</p>
