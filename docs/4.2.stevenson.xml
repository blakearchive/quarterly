                    <p>I was in Coverdale—a long way away from Blake country, I admit—a couple of weeks
ago, and I stopped to look at an old mine entrance. After I had stopped, its resemblance to Blake’s
“Death’s Door,” especially as it appears in <hi rend="i">America</hi> plate 12, struck me. That is, the
entrance consisted of a stone doorway (though without an actual door), roofed over with a large slab. What
brought the similarity to my mind was that a sizeable tree was growing above the slab, its roots twining round
the entrance (which went into a sloping hillside). Is it possible that, besides the other associations of this
image, Blake, having seen such mine entrances in his own area, thought of them as “entrances to death” in yet
another connotation? I have not been able to check whether anyone else has thought of this, or whether Kent
and Surrey yield similar doorways in fact; but someone closer to this area than I am at present may find the
idea interesting.</p>
