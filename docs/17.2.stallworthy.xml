			<q>
When wing to wing, feather by feather,<lb/>
the rooks were piecing night together,<lb/>
I took the ring the iron-lipped<lb/>
iron-lidded lion gripped<lb/>
and tapped the call-sign on his hide.<lb/>
He knew me, nodded, moved aside,<lb/>
and as the light fell through the door<lb/>
I walked into your head once more.<lb/>
<lb/>
I could distinguish, layer by layer,<lb/>
each constituent of the air:<lb/>
vellum and beeswax; apple, oak,<lb/>
and elm gone up in years of smoke;<lb/>
tanned pastry, ghosts of roasted meat;<lb/>
the breath of oxlips, wintersweet,<lb/>
jasmine, and Stanely Spencer’s tall<lb/>
corinthian hyacinths on the wall.<lb/>
<lb/>
The old clock in a fancy waist-<lb/>
coat cleared its throat and, poker-faced, pointed to Margaret’s room. I must<lb/>
have slipped in without sound or gust,<lb/>
for on the mantelpiece the frieze<lb/>
had thawed and bountiful Ceres<lb/>
bowed from a festal chariot drawn<lb/>
by cherubs shouldering sheaves of corn<lb/>
<lb/>
for Lammas. Darwin in a chair<lb/>
inhaled his beard. And through a pair<lb/>
of ancient spectacles, tugged free<lb/>
from a book’s teeth, I could see<lb/>
a knickerbockered boy advance<lb/>
to greet a flock of bustled aunts.<lb/>
The clock struck. They went out like flames<lb/>
leaving their shadows, shrunk, in frames.<lb/>
<lb/>
And I went also, up the stairs<lb/>
where Catherine Blake’s embroidered hares<lb/>
danced in the moonlight. Ran a bath<lb/>
under the gaze of a lithograph<lb/>
“Sixty-four Years a Queen,” to whom<lb/>
I bowed: “Allow me to presume<lb/>
to higher strains if you will use<lb/>
it first, ma’am.” “We are not a muse.”<lb/>
<lb/>
And so to such a downy bed<lb/>
and downy pillow that the head<lb/>
no sooner settled . . . than today<lb/>
came in with teacups on a tray.<lb/>
<lb/>
But not today, and not again<lb/>
the day sketched over the counterpane,<lb/>
an airy canvas, to be swept<lb/>
with sunlight in a south transept,<lb/>
and more than sunlight as we walk<lb/>
through Danes’ Blood, welling from the chalk,<lb/>
or in the workshop carve those two<lb/>
owl-guardians of your gateposts, who<lb/>
today, frock-coated mourners, keen<lb/>
for you as we process between.<lb/>
Your books cry your name from the shelf,<lb/>
but where’s your masterpiece—Yourself?<lb/>
<lb/>
Not in your house, or over there<lb/>
in Brinkley churchyard’s flinty loam.<lb/>
The rooks return and riot,<lb/>
the rooks return and you do not.<lb/>
I shall know where to find you, however, forever. Old master, now<lb/>
that your fire’s out, draw up a chair<lb/>
to mine, and make yourself at home.
