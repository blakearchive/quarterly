        <p>Nelson Hilton joined us as the journal’s first—and only—review editor in 1980. He has been
the stalwart and expert editorial companion to us ever since. The pleasure of working alongside Nelson issue
after issue, year after year, has been constant, and we will miss him profoundly, although he will continue to
offer advice as a member of our advisory board. His excuse for ducking out on us now is, unfortunately,
credible, as in addition to developing the University of Georgia’s general composition electronic markup and
management application (www.emmalogin.org) and teaching, he is now director of the university’s Center for
Teaching and Learning. Nelson concludes, “So, time to shed load—with a big shout-out to the many
colleagues who agreed to undertake reviews, the two who long ago imagined a greenhorn as review editor, and
all who have made working with <hi rend="i">BIQ</hi> a profound pleasure and liberal education.”</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, we are exceedingly proud to welcome as our new review editor Alexander (Sandy) Gourlay,
who teaches courses on British literature, art history, and paleography at the Rhode Island School of Design,
including an annual seminar on Hogarth and Blake. He has published several articles on Blake and edited 
<hi rend="i">Prophetic Character: Essays on William Blake in Honor of John E. Grant.</hi> He is working now on a
web-based resource for studying Blake’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> watercolors. In his own words,
Sandy “aspires in time to live up to the high standard set in this position by Nelson Hilton, and welcomes
such encomia, constructive advice, and intemperate abuse as the readership sees fit to impart.”</p>
        <p>We anticipate, with great pleasure, years of superior reviewing under Sandy’s leadership.</p>
