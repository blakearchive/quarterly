                    <p>In April and May of 1973 the University of Tulsa will present a Blake graduate
symposium under the general direction of Winston Weathers, Professor of English. The first lecture in the
symposium will be given Wednesday, 11 April, by Robert Gleckner, University of California at Riverside. The
next four <corr type="emend">weekly</corr> lectures will be given by Professor Weathers. Two final sessions,
late in May, will be devoted to the presentation of papers by the ten graduate students participating in the
symposium for credit. All sessions of the symposium will be open to the public free of charge.</p>

                    <p>This will be the third graduate offering of Blake at the University of Tulsa. The first
was a seminar in 1968 concentrating upon <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, and, according to Professor Weathers, “it
was in that seminar that the idea for <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi> was developed by Kay Parkhurst and Roger
Easson.” The second offering was a seminar in 1971 with special emphasis upon student creative work—plays
and poems primarily—written in response to Blake’s work.</p>
