          <p>The dolphin evidently never appears in Blake’s illuminations and only
                        once in his verse, in a line spoken ironically by Bromion in <hi rend="i">Visions of
the Daughters of Albion</hi> after he has
                        “enjoyed” Oothoon: “And let the jealous dolphins sport around
                        the lovely maid.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n75"
type="note">1</ref> To understand
                        some of its implications let us look briefly at the dolphin symbol and at
                        some exhibits of the Galatea legend in music and art.

          <p>According to Oliver Goldsmith, “The dolphin was celebrated in the
                        earliest time for its fondness to the human race . . . .”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n76" type="note">2</ref> In classical legend the dolphin was a

                        Arion, for example, had been popularized by Theocritus and Ovid 
(<hi rend="i">Metamorphoses</hi> XIII.738, ff.) and had been taken over into
                        emblem literature, most recently by Caesare Ripa’s English adapter
                        George Richardson.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n77"
type="note">3</ref> In this extensive

From its classical usage and
                        its popularization as an emblem, it became a symbol popular also with the
                        English poets. Both Spenser and Shakespeare referred to the Arion legend
                            (<hi rend="i">FQ</hi> III.iv.33.1 and IV. xi.23.6; <hi rend="i">Amoretti</hi>, 38;

type="note">5</ref> and Milton must have had this legend in
                        mind, doubtless among others, when in “Lycidas” he entreated for
                        the body of Edward King, “O ye <hi rend="i">Dolphins</hi>, waft the

          <p>But why are Bromion’s dolphins “jealous”? In addition to
                        serving as symbols of safety and help, dolphins were also symbols of love.
                        According to Goldsmith, the dolphin was distinguished by the epithet
                        “the boy-loving” (VI, 223). Doubtless Goldsmith had in mind
                        particularly the enamoured dolphin of Hippo whose love for a boy was related
                        by Pliny the Younger in his Epistle IX. According to Ovid and Aulus Gellius,
                        moreover, dolphins were reputed to be very amorous; and they were often
                        depicted as attributes of Aphrodite or Eros. In his <hi rend="i">Metamorphoses</hi>
Ovid related that Poseidon changed himself into a
                        dolphin in order to woo Melantho (VI. 120); and according to Spenser,
                        Hippomedes “turnd him selfe into a Dolphin fayre” (<hi rend="i">FQ</hi> III.xi.42.6)
in order to win Deucalion’s daughter.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n81"
type="note">7</ref> Even more pertinent for Blake’s
                        purpose, dolphins, according to Ovid (<hi rend="i">Fasti</hi> II.81-82),
                        traditionally assisted lovers. According to legend, a dolphin had discovered
                        the fleeing Amphitrite and had persuaded her to return to her lover,
                        Poseidon; and the grateful <corr type="emend">sea god</corr> had proclaimed the
dolphin sacred and had
                        set his image in the heavens in the constellation Delphinus.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n82" type="note">8</ref> Also, according to Erasmus, a dolphin
                        “rescued the virgin Lesbia with her lover.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n83" type="note">9</ref> Moreover the dolphin has also symbolized spiritual
                        salvation and Christ the savior.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n84"
type="note">10</ref> The
                        early Christians, for example, often employed the dolphin rather than the
                        fish as a symbol for Christ; and at the Royal Academy Blake may have noticed
                        this symbol as he looked over the treatises on the Roman catacombs. This
                        emblematism might be an additional irony intended by the materialistic
                        Bromion. At least it anticipates the spiritual salvation which Oothoon
                        attains during the course of the poem. <note id="n81"><hi rend="s">7</hi><hi rend="i">

          <p>But the dolphin-related legend which most closely fits the situation in <hi rend="i">Visions of
the Daughters of Albion</hi> is that of the nymph
                        Galatea and her lovers Acis and Polyphemos. When the Polyphemos-like Bromion
                        speaks of “jealous dolphins,” he doubtless voices his own
                        possessive view of love as well as that of the mute Theotormon; he
                        attributes jealousy also to any potential rescuer. Though in the Galatea
                        legend Polyphemos is yet to be blinded by Odysseus, he is already blinded by
                        his jealousy, like the spiritually blind Bromion and Theotormon. Moreover,
                        Bromion’s cave, in which we see the bound “adulterate pair”
                        (4.2), may well echo the cave of Polyphemos. The dolphins rescue Galatea
                        from her would-be rapist; they are ironically summoned too late to protect
                        Oothoon. Yet in the final analysis the triumph of Oothoon even exceeds that
                        of Galatea, who is likewise deprived of her lover. Both stories, moreover,
                        are extended laments: as Galatea relates her tragic love story to Scylla and
                        the other nymphs, so Oothoon relates hers to the daughters of Albion.</p>
          <p>Blake and his contemporaries could have been familiar with the Galatea legend
                        from its continued popularity in more than one medium. It was a favorite in
                        English musical drama. It had been developed by John Lyly in 1592 in his 
<hi rend="i">Gallathea</hi> and revived twice in the eighteenth century,
                        first by P. A. Motteux in 1701, with music by John Eccles, and next by John
                        Gay in 1718-19, with lovely music by Handel. Since the Gay-Handel version
                        was frequently performed from 1777 throughout the rest of the century, Blake
                        could easily have seen a performance.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n85" type="note">11</ref>
                        In February of 1786 even a ballet version was introduced, at the
                        King’s Theater.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n86"

	<note id="n86"><hi rend="s">12</hi> Ibid., II, 864.</note></p>
          <p>Blake was even more likely to have been familiar with the Acis and Galatea
                        legend in art, especially the pictorial representation of “The Triumph
                        of Galatea,” where the dolphins draw her and sport around the lovely
                        maid as she escapes from Polyphemos and turns her lover Acis into a stream.
                        Blake surely knew Raphael’s famous painting of this story, for
                        Goltzius, among others, had engraved it.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n87" type="note">13</ref> The story had also been depicted by many other artists whom
                        Blake admired: Dürer, Giulio Romano, Nicolas Poussin, several of
                        whose sketches were in Windsor Castle, and by Goltzius himself.<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n88" type="note">14</ref> In some of these versions Polyphemos
                        sits disconsolately, like the jealous Theotormon, on a rock. In one of
                        Poussin’s sketches he actually watches Galatea and Acis having sexual
                            intercourse.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n89"

          <p>The legend upon which Blake seems to have drawn helps us to focus attention
                        on his theme—the tragic effects of jealousy. Though Blake was
                        doubtless attacking physical as well as spiritual slavery, no hint of any
                        negroid features seems to appear to characterize Oothoon or Theotormon in
                        any of the plates. Their absence and the affinities in the Galatea legend
                        which Bromion’s “jealous dolphins” evoke serve also to
                        emphasize the major theme of possessiveness.</p>
