            <p>Michael J. Tolley of the University of Adelaide and Peter Otto, now of
                            the University of Melbourne, were recently given a grant by the
                            University of Adelaide as initial funding for a new multivolume
                            annotated edition of Blake. Margaret Hood, who has just successfully
                            completed her doctoral thesis on “The Pleasant Charge:
                            William Blake’s Multiple Roles for Women,” is
                            already working as a part-time research assistant for the project. Other
                            editors are being consulted.</p>
            <p>One of the first texts in preparation is <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, for
                            which Otto will have special responsibility, although Tolley, as General
                            Editor, will be working closely with him and with other editors, as one
                            of the major assets of the new edition is expected to be derived from
                            his long-accumulating files of source materials and other scholarly
                            notes. Tolley himself is beginning work on <hi rend="i">The Marriage of
                                Heaven and Hell.</hi></p>
            <p>As is usual in a variorum edition, the contributions of previous
                            commentators will be brought together but subjected to a rigorous
                            critical sifting and supplemented by new readings. A new feature, though
                            this enterprise must be difficult, will be an endeavor to take greater
                            account of the differing reading experiences of each copy of
                            Blake’s illuminated poems; in this sense, also, the new work
                            may be considered a variorum edition. The aim of the editorial
                            undertaking is genuinely to “open” the texts,
                            while freeing them from critical encumbrances.</p>
