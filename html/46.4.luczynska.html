<p class="title">“Life exhal’d in milky fondness”—Becoming a Mother in William Blake’s <em>The Book of Thel</em></p>
<p class="byline">By Małgorzata Łuczyńska-Hołdys</p>
<p class="note"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Małgorzata Łuczyńska-Hołdys</span> (<a href="mailto:m.holdys@uw.edu.pl">m.holdys@uw.edu.pl</a>)
 works as an assistant professor at the Institute of English Studies, 
Warsaw University. Her research interests include romantic and Victorian
 poetry, images of femininity in literature and art, and Pre-Raphaelite 
painting. She has published articles on Blake, Keats, Tennyson, and 
Swinburne. Her book <em>Soft-Shed Kisses: Re-visioning the Femme Fatale in English Poetry of the Nineteenth Century</em> awaits publication.</p>
</div>
<div id="text">
<p>Blake critics most often see <em>The Book of Thel</em> as a thwarted attempt <span class="notecall">to pass from the state of Innocence to Experience.</span><span class="sidenote">See Bloom 49, Raine 52, Frye 232-33, Damon 52, 401, Gleckner 163-64, Ankarsjö 62.</span>
 Blake’s heroine is usually perceived as a somewhat naive, indecisive 
young female afraid to “be born” into the world of adulthood and 
maturity, or as a soul that refuses to enter the material world. <span class="notecall">Hence,
 there has been a tendency to pass judgment on Thel’s decision, to 
attribute it to weakness, immaturity, or fear, and to see it in 
pejorative terms.</span><span class="sidenote">For example, Gleckner 
concludes that Thel is self-centered and sternly pronounces that she has
 to learn the life of self-sacrifice (163), while Behrendt asserts that,
 for Blake, Thel must have been an example of what he calls “the 
dead-end nature of narcissistic behavior” (27). For Matthews, Thel’s 
flight means conforming to stereotypes of femininity (100).</span> My 
claim is that Thel’s refusal to enter the world of Generation has 
nothing to do with relapsing into childhood, or with weakness and 
indecisiveness. Instead, I see it as proof of her maturity and 
independent spirit. My article is concerned with two problems. <span class="notecall">Firstly, I want to demonstrate how text and design in <em>The Book of Thel</em> enter a mutual semantic relationship of contradiction and/or redundancy rather than complementarity.</span><span class="sidenote">For the various types of image-text relations, see A. Kibédi Varga, “Criteria for Describing Word-Image Relations,” <em>Poetics Today</em> 10 (1989): 31-53.</span>
 Naturally, this claim is not new; W. J. T. Mitchell recognized this 
quality as early as 1978, writing that “the ‘unity’ of an illuminated 
book is a dynamic one, built upon the interaction of text and design as 
independent or contrary elements” (xviii). What I would like to examine,
 however, is how this dynamic interaction reinforces a feminist reading 
of Blake’s text. Secondly, although there are critical texts that deal 
with Blake’s attitude to women, the majority of Blake scholarship on <em>The Book of Thel</em>
 does not seem sufficiently feminist. While he did not manifest an 
unwaveringly feminist stance throughout his poetry, in texts such as <em>Thel</em> or <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em>
 he dealt with women’s issues in a way that may be deemed progressive. 
Consequently, I intend to focus on the problems of motherhood and 
childcare as rendered by Blake in his poem, since I perceive these 
notions to be essential for our understanding of Thel’s decision. Also, 
part of my argument is that, contrary to a number of critical readings, 
the message delivered by Thel’s three interlocutors (the Lilly, the 
Cloud, and the Clod of Clay) should not be seen as a positive statement 
that Blake wanted Thel to accept. Finally, if we comprehend Thel’s 
dilemma—whether to become a mother—this can shed light on some actions 
taken by other female characters in Blake’s later texts, Oothoon and 
Enitharmon in particular.</p>
<p>Generally it has been agreed that the issues of gender and sexuality provide a valid interpretative context for <em>The Book of Thel</em>, as “the consequence of the expression of sexual desire is the great theme of Blake’s prophetic poems” (Hayes 144). <span class="notecall">Thus, David Worrall suggests that <em>The Book of Thel</em>
 is Blake’s correction to Swedenborg’s ideas of sexuality: Thel’s escape
 “with a shriek” is “a specific refusal of Swedenborg’s doctrine of 
conjugal love, a subject topical to contemporary Swedenborgians who were
 proposing to establish an African colony based on its principles” (17).</span><span class="sidenote">Other important texts that discuss Blake’s connections to Swedenborg’s thought are Schuchard’s <em>Why Mrs. Blake Cried</em>, Viscomi’s 1997, 1998, and 1999 essays on <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>, and Magnus Ankarsjö, <em>William Blake and Religion</em> (Jefferson: McFarland, 2009). Also, in their introduction to <em>The Book of Thel</em> in <em>The Early Illuminated Books</em>,
 Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi note echoes of Swedenborgian thought 
(particularly with reference to his doctrine of use) in Blake’s poem 
(78).</span> However, as Susan Matthews notices, the vales of Har (the 
place that Worrall sees as the realm of Swedenborgian sexual union) are 
the world to which, and not from which, Thel flees (100). Matthews, in 
turn, sees the flight of Thel at the end of the poem as an escape from 
conflict rather than from sexuality, and interprets the vales of Har as a
 world where “benefit to the other is benefit to the self” and where, 
consequently, the self does not exist (99). Also, for her, the flight 
back is not the assertion of the self but a surrender of the self: “At 
the end of the poem, Thel flees to a female dream like that of <em>The Triumphs of Temper</em>
 which makes sexual desire safe but demands as the price the taking on 
of a female identity” (100).&nbsp;In a similar vein, Magnus Ankarsjö, in
 <em>Blake and Gender</em>, notices that “although sometimes executing 
successful representations of the female, Blake in the early poems is at
 pains to find an appropriate expression of the positive interactivity 
of man and woman” (3). He locates Thel within the circle of “childlike 
innocent characters” (5) and concludes that she “utterly fails and 
relapses back to childhood” (62). In the course of this paper, I hope to
 demonstrate that it is possible to see Thel’s decision not as a failure
 or a surrender of the self, but as an act of self-assertion, a 
conscious decision to reject the perspective (however attractive at 
times) of both sexual relationship and childbearing. Such a decision is 
not a product of an immature, wavering, childlike mind but testifies to 
the opposite. Last but not least, it also denotes readiness to face the 
conflict that ensues from acting against the expectations of 
others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modern critical readings recognize the importance of <span class="notecall">dialogical structure in <em>The Book of Thel</em>.</span><span class="sidenote">See Levinson and Linkin.</span>&nbsp;Most
 of the poem is structured by question-answer exchanges, often 
summarized by Thel’s rephrasing of what she has heard. The common 
denominator of these conversations is Thel’s inquiry, which is followed 
by reassuring statements from other beings already familiar with the 
world that she contemplates entering. The chief question, then, is what 
it would mean for Thel to enter this world, Blake’s realm of Generation,
 or Experience. Entering it may be understood as a conscious decision to
 grow up and to assume the social roles prescribed for a woman in the 
adult world—primarily the role of mother.</p>
<p>Crucially, however, pregnancy and motherhood are preceded by 
courtship and marriage. This point has been noted and discussed from 
various perspectives by modern critics. Thus, Harriet Kramer Linkin 
identifies what frightens Thel off as the sexual nature of human 
relationships in the world of Generation. She suggests that Thel’s 
“horror at being food for worms actually displaces her deeper fear of 
the phallus” and that Thel wilfully chooses to ignore the sexual 
implications of the Cloud’s speech, instead focusing on the nurturing 
function voiced by the Clod of Clay (69). In the wake of feminist 
criticism, Helen Bruder, in an interpretation to which I am deeply 
indebted, sees <em>Thel</em> as a poem in which “the sceptical enquiries
 of a determined young woman thoroughly unmask patriarchal ideology, an 
ideology which promised women that heterosexual romantic and maternal 
roles equalled heavenly fulfilment, but which Thel discovers amount to 
nothing less than death” (44). Reading the key passage in which the Clod
 of Clay appears as mother of the Worm, she concludes that “anyone who 
‘her life exhal’d / In milky fondness’ (<em>Thel</em>, 4:8-9; E.5) has been severely gulled if she believes that this amounts to having ‘a crown that none can take away’ (<em>Thel</em>, 5:4; E.5)” (51).</p>
<p>My discussion coincides with the above interpretations in that I also
 think the ideology of self-sacrifice, as promoted by the Clod of Clay 
and the Lilly, to be the key to understanding Blake’s poem. In addition,
 I propose that Thel is actually attracted both to the idea of sexual 
union and to the idea of becoming a mother, but she cannot reconcile her
 desires with what such fulfillment would mean in a world where the 
female is generally given one role, that of a humble servant with no 
voice of her own. What frightens Thel off is the philosophy of 
utilitarianism and self-denial embodied in the Clod of Clay and, to a 
lesser extent, in the Lilly and the Cloud. <span class="notecall">The Cloud’s conviction that becoming “the food of worms” (3.25, E 5)</span><span class="sidenote">All quotations of Blake’s poems are from Erdman, <em>Complete Poetry and Prose</em>.</span> might be enough to sing the song of self-fulfillment is another successful deterrent.</p>
<p>Thel is an adolescent. <span class="notecall">Generally, her name has
 been interpreted as signifying “wish” or “desire,” but&nbsp;another 
meaning has also been suggested—“woman.”</span><span class="sidenote">Linkin 67n7, relating the suggestion of E. B. Murray.</span> Thus, Thel contemplates what it means to be a woman, and whether it is what she really desires. <span class="notecall">Her
 interest in these questions, as well as her essential ambivalence, is 
mirrored in the title-page design (illus. 1), where she observes 
intently but with apprehension the passionate embrace of two tiny 
creatures emerging from a flowering plant, one male and one female.</span><span class="sidenote">The plates that I discuss are from <em>The Book of Thel</em> copy H (Library of Congress), <em>William Blake Archive</em> &lt;﻿<a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/" target="_blank">http://www.blakearchive.org</a>﻿&gt;.

<span class="notecall">Kathleen Raine claims that the designs for <em>Thel</em> “express, even more than those of <em>Songs of Innocence</em>, the easy grace, freedom and expressive sweetness characteristic of Blake’s vision of ‘Innocence’” (52).</span><span class="sidenote">In a similar vein, Mitchell, in his <em>Blake’s Composite Art</em>, writes that “the title page depicts the courting dance of the Cloud and Dew as a whirling vortex of pleasure” (105).</span>
 Is that really so? Unquestionably, we see the characteristic 
weightlessness of Blake’s figures and delicate, almost fragile lines, 
but the apparent sweetness of the plates is deceptive. Careful 
observation reveals darker, more troubling echoes. <span class="notecall">Thel
 seems unsure how to understand the scene she is witnessing: the 
passionate embrace of the couple could be an externalization of their 
erotic love, but it could also be a scene of entrapment, against which 
the female seems to be striving.</span><span class="sidenote">Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi note the ambiguity of the scene in <em>The Early Illuminated Books</em> (82).</span>
 Could the raised arms of the female figure perhaps express her fear of 
the union? She is clearly moving away from the naked, plunging body of 
her partner. David Erdman, in his <em>Illuminated Blake</em>, gives an account of Erasmus Darwin’s <em>The Loves of the Plants</em> as a possible source of Blake’s illustrations of plants in <em>The Book of Thel</em>.&nbsp;<em>The Loves of the Plants</em> appeared in 1789 as part of <em>The Botanic Garden</em>,
 “a poetic guide, in the idiom of ‘The Rape of the Lock,’ to the sexual 
behavior of the male and female parts of garden flowers” (33). The plant
 that Blake makes the focal point of the title page to <em>Thel</em> is 
anemone pulsatilla, a flower that needs the wind to open its petals. As 
Erdman recounts, Darwin’s imagery is straightforwardly erotic: the 
flower yearns for the wind’s “cherub-lips,” which are then to rend its 
“gauzy veil” (34). Ecstasy mixes with aggression and submission. Thel, 
standing aside, looks at the scene carefully but with uncertainty. On 
the one hand, she is fascinated by the promise of an adult, sexual 
relationship; on the other hand, she senses both violence and the power 
struggle inherent in such a relationship in the world of Generation. 
Thus, her fascination mingles with fear, but the questioning stance very
 well reflects her inquisitive attitude toward reality, her inner 
compulsion to ask unsettling questions.
<p>In <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> and in his annotations to
 Lavater, Blake expresses his conviction that human life should mean an 
active search for fulfillment. He claims that it is better to “murder an
 infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires” (<em>Marriage</em> 10.67, E 38) and that “all Act [&lt;<em>from Individual propensity</em>&gt;]
 is Virtue” (annotations to Lavater p. 226, E 601). Staying passive, one
 becomes like poisonous standing water with “reptiles of the mind” (<em>Marriage</em> 19, E 42), since “he who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence” (<em>Marriage</em> 7.5, E 35). <span class="notecall">Although it is possible to see Thel as a passive, indecisive figure, since her search is inconclusive,</span><span class="sidenote">Some
 earlier critics seem to ignore Thel’s inquisitiveness, or to attribute 
it to a whiny, self-centered attitude; see, for example, Damon 401, 
Bloom 53, and Frye 233.</span> this interpretation overlooks the fact 
that, unlike all the other characters in the poem, she exhibits a 
pondering, questioning attitude. The Lilly and the Clod exult in their 
productive, selfless lives. Thel’s sisters have also become 
characterized by the duties that they fulfill: as shepherdesses, they 
obediently “led round their sunny flocks” (1.1, E 3), even if, as Bruder
 suggests, they run in circles (44-45). If they have desires, they do 
their best to suppress them. In contrast, Thel actively searches for 
fulfillment and ponders what this fulfillment implies and whether it 
would cost her dear. Her resistance is much more active than her 
compliance could ever be.</p>
<p>Thel, as the reader meets her for the first time, is deeply worried, 
and she feels alienated in her anxieties, brooding over them “in 
paleness” and in secrecy (1.2, E 3). In this way Blake stresses her 
position as an outsider, which she occupies at the beginning and retains
 to the end of the book. Although she inhabits the vales of Har, which 
have been traditionally interpreted as a paradise-like world (Blake’s 
Beulah or preexistence), and thus is not subject to death, Thel in her 
first lamentation is concerned with mutability. She compares herself to 
all beautiful but transient phenomena in the material world, such as “a 
watry bow,” “a parting cloud,” “a reflection in a glass,” “dreams of 
infants,” “shadows in the water,” “music in the air” (1.8-11, E 3). The 
Lilly of the Valley, the first of Thel’s interlocutors, is puzzled by 
her worries, and asks “then why should Thel complain, / Why should the 
mistress of the vales of Har, utter a sigh” (1.25, 2.1, E 4)? Despite 
being a daughter of the Seraphim, Thel stubbornly refuses to see herself
 as immortal. While this point may be explained by noting that 
transience is the chief feature of the world that Thel contemplates 
entering—the cause of her fears—such an interpretation soon proves 
elusive: all the creatures that she talks to proclaim the existence of 
an afterlife, and the Clod of Clay, inviting Thel into her kingdom, 
assures her that “’tis given thee to enter, / And to return” (5.16-17, E
 6). Though Thel need not fear disintegration in death, she is not 
comforted by any of the speeches and continues to cast herself as a 
transient, mutable being, different from those she meets on her way. As 
James Swearingen perceptively notes, “Her unity with the life of the 
fabulous setting is already disrupted. That unity does not belong to the
 time of the poem; it is a narrative memory, a hypothetical condition 
‘before’ her differentiation from other things living alongside her in 
the vales of Har” (128). Gradually, however, she turns to contemplating a
 purpose rather than the transience of her existence. Very quickly she 
concludes that there is no aim, no use in her life. She claims that she 
wants to leave a trace of her existence instead of disappearing without a
 mark. Thus, it may be suggested that death for Thel is nothing but 
insignificance. The main problem, however, around which the rest of the 
text is structured, is how to signify without having one’s identity 
totally obliterated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lilly of the Valley is Thel’s opposite. She describes herself in 
terms of modesty, humility, hard work, and cheerfulness. She is “very 
small” and dwells in “lowly vales” (1.17, E 4); she is a weak and gentle
 maid who does not talk too much, only bows “her modest head” (2.17, E 
4) and resides in “modest brooks” and “silent valleys” (1.22, E 4), 
where she goes to “mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass” 
(2.18, E 4). Her description adheres to the doctrine of self-sacrifice 
that underlies <em>Thel</em>. Morris Eaves, Robert Essick, and Joseph 
Viscomi attribute this ideology to “contemporary handbooks for young 
ladies that taught the docile acceptance of servitude to masculine 
desires and expectations” (<em>The Early Illuminated Books</em> 80), and
 this seems to be the case with the Lilly. She believes that her 
behavior is bound to be rewarded: she will be “clothed in light” and 
“fed with morning manna” (1.23, E 4). She feels gratefulness toward him 
“that smiles on all” (1.19, E 4) (critics still debate whether he is God
 from Eden or just a male cloud). Regardless of the ambiguity, this 
presence is unquestionably male and his behavior, as well as the Lilly’s
 humble and grateful response from her position of dependency, defines 
her world as patriarchal. Since, in the Lilly’s perception, her 
existence amounts to a happy and fulfilled life, she cannot understand 
Thel’s doubts and worries. Why should Thel complain, if, upon entering 
the adult social world, she will be rewarded in exactly the same way for
 exactly the same behavior? <span class="notecall">She previews Dante 
Gabriel Rossetti’s&nbsp; “an angel-watered lily” (the ideal female) from
 the sonnets written to accompany the painting <em>The Girlhood of Mary Virgin</em>,</span><span class="sidenote">Rossetti
 wrote two sonnets to accompany his painting; their collective title is 
“Mary’s Girlhood (For a Picture),” and they are numbered I and II. The 
quotations come from the first sonnet (see the <a href="http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/pr5240.f11.rad.html#p173" target="_blank">poem</a> in the <em>Rossetti Archive</em> &lt;﻿<a href="http://www.rossettiarchive.org/" target="_blank">http://​www.​rossettiarchive.​org</a>﻿&gt;).</span>
 a lily that “near God / Grows and is quiet” (lines 10-11). Rossetti 
characterizes Mary (the lily) by “simplicity of intellect, / And supreme
 patience” (lines 5-6), while her virtues correspond to the books that 
she studies: hope, faith, and charity. The Lilly, as her name suggests, 
signifies purity, virginity, and innocence, but it is interesting to 
remember that lilies have another primary symbolic association: death. 
This makes Blake’s symbolism extraordinarily consistent, and links the 
Lilly to other elements in the text associated with death and mourning: 
the Clod of Clay, tombs, worms, withering of the body, and elegiac 
overtones. Would existence akin to that of the Lilly mean death for 
Thel? Strikingly, though,&nbsp; Thel sees the Lilly as the essence of 
motherhood and maternal care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may recall here an interesting biographical speculation offered by S. Foster Damon, who suggests that <em>The Book of Thel</em>
 might have been an elegy written by Blake on the death of his daughter,
 lost through miscarriage (401), though no biographers support this 
conjecture. Certainly, the theme of motherhood is one of the chief 
concerns in Blake’s poem. What is the vision of motherhood endorsed by 
the text, then, and how does it clash with what Thel would like it to 
be? The answer is partly revealed in the first dialogic exchange, with 
the Lilly of the Valley, and implicated in all subsequent interactions 
that Thel initiates.</p>
<p>When Thel rephrases the Lilly’s answer, she arrives at her own 
interpretation of the Lilly’s life. She describes her in terms of 
servitude and meekness, which become synonymous with nursing and 
mothering: the Lilly, Thel says, nourishes the innocent lamb, feeds him,
 cleans him, cherishes him. What is more, the Lilly is characterized by 
her “milky garments” (2.5, E 4), which straightforwardly figure 
breastfeeding and foreshadow the Clod’s “milky fondness” (4.9, E 5). 
Finally, she calmly accepts the prospect of her sacrifice: while the 
lamb devours her flowers she sits “smiling in his face” (2.6, E 4). The 
Lilly also attends to other living creatures: her perfume “revives the 
milked cow” and “tames the fire-breathing steed” (2.10, E 4). The 
question implied in this passage, therefore, concerns the extent to 
which selfless giving may be reconciled with one’s own needs. What is 
left of the Lilly when her flowers are cropped, her leaves become the 
bed for worms, and her perfume is scattered all over the grass?</p>
<p>At the end of this encounter, Thel reasserts her difference from the 
Lilly, but it seems that her emotional response to the Lilly’s speech is
 not negative at all. As she contemplates the possibility of becoming a 
mother, she looks at the Lilly with interest and only slight 
apprehension. Thel’s own vision of nursing and care appears to have 
diverted her attention from the real meaning of the Lilly’s speech, 
which represents an essentially submissive position of humble 
dependence. Her positive attitude toward the Lilly (or her refashioning 
of the Lilly’s function) can be detected when she contrasts her own 
futility with the Lilly’s existence. Thel imagines herself now as a 
“faint cloud” (2.11, E 4) that experiences mutability and does not leave
 a trace when it vanishes from its “pearly throne” (2.12, E 4).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As if by the touch of a magic wand, the personified—distinctly 
male—Cloud appears. While the Cloud seems to answer Thel’s worries 
connected with mutability, stressing the life cycles in nature, he 
primarily embodies the principle of sexual love. The fact that Thel sees
 him as attractive is figured in her description of him as&nbsp;a 
“bright form” with a “golden head” (3.5, E 4), shiny and glittering. 
Erdman notes the tones of “sexual encounter and aggressive masculinity” 
in <em>The Book of Thel</em>, which he attributes to Darwin’s <em>The Botanic Garden</em> (<em>The Illuminated Blake</em>
 33). Similarly, Bruder concludes that the Cloud’s speech is suggestive 
of violent appropriation: he, the only male in the text, violates the 
fair-eyed dew, who cries and trembles, afraid of their union (48). Such a
 reading, however, is not wholly convincing: after all, the Cloud is 
said to court the dew (courtship connotes gentle and tender behavior), 
which results in his being invited to the dew’s shining tent. Thus, the 
sexual union that ensues is both feared and wanted by the “fair eyed 
dew” (3.13, E 5), and it happens with, rather than without, her consent.
 The dew, in her virginity, simultaneously desires and is afraid of 
sexual fulfillment. Hence, the Cloud is undeniably masculine and 
decisive, but not necessarily violent and aggressively appropriative.</p>
<p>Thel’s attraction to the idea of partnership and sexual union is 
clearly spelled out in the illustration accompanying plate 4 (illus. 2).

</div>
The design serves as a visual bridge between plates 3 and 4. While the 
text of plate 3 consists of the Cloud’s speech, there is no visual 
equivalent of this scene on the plate. As I suggested earlier, I believe
 that some designs to <em>The Book of Thel</em> contradict, rather than 
complement, the text, and I see plates 3 and 4&nbsp;as examples of this 
contradiction. There is nothing in the text of plate 3 to suggest that 
Thel has been convinced by the Cloud’s speech, which explains how a 
female can find meaning in the world of Generation. The text depicts the
 moment that Thel finds hard to accept when the Cloud defines the proper
 place and significance for her in such terms:
<blockquote>Then if thou art the food of worms. O virgin of the skies,<br>
How great thy use. how great thy blessing; every thing that lives,<br>
Lives not alone, nor for itself. (3.25-27, E 5)</blockquote>
Laura Quinney notices the contradiction between Thel’s expectations and 
the ultimate message communicated to her by the Cloud, and reads this 
statement as ironic:
<blockquote>It would be a mistake to think that Blake endorses this 
idea. The Cloud goes on to explain, “everything that lives, / Lives not 
alone, nor for itself” (Thel 3:26-27, E5), but this assertion is not to 
be confused with Blake’s “Everything that lives is <em>Holy</em>” (MHH 
25, E45; my italics). In the Cloud’s absurd suggestion, Blake is mocking
 the attempt to redeem strictly natural existence. Consciousness cannot 
be content with its fate because the body nurtures worms. (32)</blockquote>
The conflict between Thel’s aspirations and the Cloud’s ideology is 
straightforwardly indicated when she complains in the previous lines
<blockquote>And all shall say, without a use this shining woman liv’d,<br>
Or did she only live. to be at death the food of worms. (3.22-23, E 5)</blockquote>
This exchange testifies to the crucial misunderstanding: for Thel, 
feeding the worms is the ultimate sign of nothingness and 
insignificance, while her interlocutor understands it as the essence of 
both use and significance. Despite the obvious conflict of attitudes and
 expectations,&nbsp;Blake chooses to portray Thel with open, 
outstretched arms prior to the moment in the text where this openness is
 indicated. Her verbal acceptance is delayed until after her 
conversation with the Clod of Clay in plate 5. Yet, in the design to 
plate 4, Thel is open and inviting; the apprehension signaled by her 
wary, cautious position as an outsider in the title plate has vanished. 
The explanation of this contradiction must be seen in her response to 
the appearance of the Cloud and the account of his sexual, impregnating 
function, rather than to his words about feeding the worms after death, 
which, as we have seen, clash acutely with Thel’s expectations. As yet, 
Thel overlooks the connection between motherhood and such a sacrifice: 
after all, she herself described the Lilly of the Valley as being 
devoured by the lamb, but at that moment she seemed to praise the Lilly 
for her nurturing stance.
<p>Blake depicts the Cloud in the design to plate 4, later than his 
appearance in the text, on the plate that simultaneously shows Thel’s 
encounter with the Worm. This device can be seen as an example of what 
Mitchell calls “the technique of syncopation” and defines as placing 
designs “at a physical and metaphoric distance from their best textual 
reference” (193). A naked male figure flies with his arms outstretched 
in the upper part of the design, while in the lower part we see Thel 
standing above a little worm-like infant “wrapped in the Lillys leaf” 
(4.3, E 5). Blake’s decision to depict both encounters within one design
 suggests that the intention was to stress the inevitable relationship 
between sexuality and birth. If Thel decides to be a mother, first she 
has to accept her role as a sexual partner. Thel looks at the Worm with 
arms ready to embrace. Strikingly, plate 4 shows one of the few moments 
in the designs to <em>Thel</em> where she stands as if inviting, or actively wanting to embrace, the new experience.&nbsp; <span class="notecall">In
 Blake’s designs, human postures are always suggestive of mental or 
spiritual conditions, and, as a number of critics have demonstrated, 
leaping, open, dancing figures with outstretched arms are often 
contrasted with bound, bent, constricted and confined, closed postures.</span><span class="sidenote">For
 discussion of similar human figures and their postures, see Warner. 
Raine states straightforwardly: “There are, for Blake’s human figures, 
essentially two conditions—the unconfined freedom of unimpeded energy; 
and the constricted, fettered, weighted and cramped state of the 
prisoners of Urizen’s universe of mechanized nature” (111).</span></p>
<p>Thel’s gesture is an exact parallel of the Cloud’s outstretched arms.
 Wanting to hold the baby, she accepts her sexuality as well and, like 
“fair eyed dew,” invites erotic union. Thus, my reading contradicts the 
view that Thel “is especially unresponsive to potentialities that she is
 unwilling to acknowledge in herself, most obviously her sexuality. Her 
interest assumes the form of a safe maternal superiority and attends to 
the Worm only as mediated by the Clod of Clay” (Swearingen 133). I 
believe that Thel consciously seeks the articulation of her feminine 
desire (as suggested by the possibilities of meaning inherent in her 
name), which embraces both sexual partnership and maternal love. 
However, she becomes discouraged and frightened by the implications 
accompanying this prospect mediated to her by other presences in the 
text (most crucially, the Clod of Clay) and seen during her thwarted 
attempt to enter Generation.</p>
<p>This discouragement is represented in the design to plate 5 (illus. 
3), where Thel is sitting under a threatening plant, her posture the 
reverse of what it was in plate 4.

Erdman identifies this plant as Meadia or dodecatheon, which “extends 
one blushing blossom above her [Thel’s] head, still closed (compare the 
bud thrusting near in Plate ii) but beginning to put forth long stamens 
(a strongly phallic assertion in the Darwinian context)” (<em>The Illuminated Blake</em> 39). Thel’s whole body communicates defensiveness. Embracing herself, she wants only to be left alone. <span class="notecall">This gesture is a frequent indicator of despair and dejection in Blake’s designs.</span><span class="sidenote">Compare the design for <em>The First Book of Urizen</em> pl. 7, where Los “howld in a dismal stupor” (7.1, E 74), as well as the figure of Theotormon embracing himself in <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> pl. i.</span>
 At Thel’s feet Blake depicts a mother playing with a child (a 
personified vision of the Clod and the Worm), but now Thel rejects even 
the experience that so far was attractive to her. Her bowed head 
obscures her face and suggests that she does not want to observe the 
joyful play. The flowers and plants in this plate are either predatory 
(on the right) or withered (on the left) and powerfully communicate 
Thel’s inner state: threatened, she mourns her withered hopes. Behind 
her we see a gloomy, dark cloud. The price to pay for fulfillment as a 
lover and a mother, after all, turned out to be too high.
<p>Plate 5 is another example of the contradiction between design and 
text. Blake devotes two plates of text to Thel’s encounter with the Worm
 and the Clod of Clay, but while plate 4 describes Thel’s essentially 
positive vision of the Worm as a child and the emergence of the mother 
figure, the Clod of Clay, plate 5 stresses aspects of feminine roles in 
the world of Generation that Thel rejects. The decision to separate, 
through the division between plates, these two verbal exchanges supports
 the claim that it is not the experience of motherhood that Thel rejects
 as such, but the way in which this experience is mediated to her 
through the figure of the Clod, who is a sum of the attitudes of female 
servitude and submissiveness and who, even more importantly, harbors the
 opinion of her own unworthiness and insignificance <em>as a person</em>
 outside her role as a mother. Thus, in plate 4, the meeting with the 
Worm results in a spontaneous overflow of maternal feelings on Thel’s 
part: she sees the Worm as helpless, naked, weak, and crying, and pities
 it for its loneliness. In a way testifying to her lack of practice, she
 tries to comfort it, urging it not to weep (4.4, E 5). At this moment 
the Clod of Clay materializes and appears to Thel as pitying, humble, 
and caring. Blake connects her to Thel’s earlier perception of the 
Lilly’s milky garments: the image of the Clod’s nursing the Worm results
 in “her life exhal’d / In milky fondness” (4.8-9, E 5). This striking 
image communicates the essence of motherhood: on the one hand, 
selflessness on the verge of self-sacrifice when, breastfeeding a baby, 
the woman gives the best part of herself to her child; on the other 
hand, “milky fondness,” which suggests love and willingness to do so. It
 is not a grudging, calculating, resentful giving, but a true gift of 
the heart as well as of the body. This is the vision to which Thel is 
drawn, as we see her in plate 4, where she is standing with open arms 
full of love and tenderness.</p>
<p>Toward the end of plate 4, however, complications emerge. The Clod of Clay proceeds to inform Thel of her own unworthiness:
</p><blockquote>Thou seest me the meanest thing, and so I am indeed;<br>
My bosom of itself is cold. and of itself is dark. (4.11-12, E 5)</blockquote>
In short, alone and by herself, she believes that she is nothing. She 
needs a man (God?) to give her significance and a function to uplift her
 status through marriage and childbirth, and this is how plate 5 starts:
<blockquote>But he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head.<br>
And kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast.<br>
And says; Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee.<br>
And I have given thee a crown that none can take away. (5.1-4, E 5-6)</blockquote>
Although she finds erotic and maternal love alluring, Thel has no 
inclination to accept it as her only purpose of existence and her duty. 
She wants to see it as her active choice that would be appreciated and 
met with thankfulness, not as something that she needs to be thankful 
for. Her maternal instincts to cherish and hold are alive and well, 
which is also true of her desire for partnership and marital union. 
Nevertheless, Thel’s intellect rebels at the Clod’s message asserting 
her meaninglessness, her internal conviction that she of herself is 
dark, mean, and cold and is given meaning only by being impregnated. She
 does not want to accept the attitude indicated in the Clod’s humble “I 
ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love” (5.6, E 6). This is 
the probable reason for Thel’s unresponsiveness, shown in the design.
<p>Interestingly, this is a moment where the design and the text 
evidently clash again. In the text, Thel’s response to the words of the 
Clod suggests welcoming and willing reception: she wipes her tears and 
proclaims her readiness to enter Generation after all. The explanation 
of the shift in her stance, nevertheless, is peculiar: Thel rephrases 
the Clod’s speech but, as happened earlier in the conversation with the 
Lilly, it seems that she has heard a message different from the one 
understood by the reader. Has she even been listening to what the Clod 
said? Thel states:
</p><blockquote>Alas! I knew not this, and therefore did I weep:<br>
That God would love a Worm I knew, and punish the evil foot<br>
That wilful, bruis’d its helpless form: but that he cherish’d it<br>
With milk and oil, I never knew; and therefore did I weep. (5.8-11, E 6)</blockquote>
When Thel was listening to the Lilly, she screened out the meaning of 
her words: instead of the Lilly’s proclamation of her smallness, 
humbleness, modesty, humility, and insignificance, Thel noticed only her
 nurturing, giving, open attitude. Now, summarizing what the Clod said, 
she concentrates on the notion that God cherishes every living creature 
(the Clod never said that!) and, consequently, she convinces herself to 
seek fulfillment in the world of adulthood and maturity. She does not, 
at that point, consciously notice the ideology endorsed by the Clod 
because the Clod talks about what Thel desires: love, marital union, and
 childbearing. The vision of partnership and maternity is so tempting 
that Thel overlooks graver implications in her words. It is as if the 
Thel of the text is more naive and more easily deluded than the Thel of 
the designs. No wonder that when she finally enters Generation and sees 
with her own eyes the world whose patriarchal rules the Lilly, the 
Cloud, and the Clod of Clay described, she turns from it in revulsion, 
and, shrieking, flies back into the vales of Har.
<p>The design accompanying the last plate of <em>The Book of Thel</em> (illus. 4) is an example of a verbal-visual relationship known as redundancy. <span class="notecall">While
 so far we have encountered one-to-one correspondence, by which every 
design has its equivalent in a passage of the text, the last design 
stands apart.</span><span class="sidenote">The tendency to accompany 
text with designs that seem not to illustrate it is prominent in other 
prophetic books, and the designs for <em>The First Book of Urizen</em> may serve as an example (see pls. 15 and 27). Within <em>The Book of Thel</em>
 pl. 1 is similar to a certain extent, but in comparison with the last 
plate it is still easier to find parallels with the text; Erdman 
suggests that “both the eagle man and the armed man adumbrate the 
‘fighting men in ambush’ that haunt Thel in Plate 6” (<em>The Illuminated Blake</em> 35).</span>
 Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi call this plate “less an illustration to the
 text than a visual commentary on it or a final vision providing an 
alternative ending to <em>Thel</em>” (<em>The Early Illuminated Books</em> 85).

Blake presents a striking image of two young children and an adolescent 
girl riding a snake in a way suggestive of both joy inherent in the 
activity and control exerted over the creature. The children play on the
 loops of the serpent; the girl, in a red dress in this copy, firmly 
holds the reins in her hand. <span class="notecall">Some critics do not identify the girl with Thel.</span><span class="sidenote">Neither
 Erdman nor Damon identifies the girl with Thel. Damon sees “a girl, 
with a light bridle” guiding “the Serpent of Nature” (52), while Erdman 
decisively states that the girl is not Thel and contrasts her “easy 
riding of the phallic serpent” with Thel’s shriek (<em>The Illuminated Blake</em> 40).</span>
 Others, like Anne Mellor, see the design as a triumphant symbol of 
Thel’s overcoming her fears,&nbsp; suggesting that it is “an emblem of 
the ability of Innocence to bridle or control the evils of the land of 
death, … and to reaffirm the wisdom of Innocence” (36), which will 
enable Thel later to “joyfully lead round her ‘sunny flocks,’ secure and
 lovingly productive in the mutable but holy world of Innocence” (37). 
The second part of Mellor’s statement is problematic. In my view, Thel 
is present in the design and she is triumphant, but her rite of passage 
has been precisely to recognize the fact that she does not want to be 
“lovingly productive” and to “joyfully lead … her ‘sunny flocks,’” at 
least not round and round, as her sisters do in plate 1. I think, 
rather, that this design is indicative of Thel’s inner transformation: 
instead of female malleability and perfect compliance with the roles 
that have been written for her, she takes the reins of control into her 
own hands and writes her role herself. I see this design as the most 
optimistic, as it implies maturity and decisiveness on Thel’s part, but 
does not exclude joy and fulfillment (as suggested by the presence of 
the playing children). It appears that Thel has finally found a way out 
of her dilemma and a life in which her worth does not entirely depend on
 how good she is at serving and self-denial, a life of which we see only
 a glimpse and which is not narrated in her book. The change of color of
 her dress in this copy, from white to dark pink, signifies that the 
rite of passage has been completed.
<p>Two poems from <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> that 
also deal with maternal love and childbearing throw additional light on 
Thel’s dilemma concerning fulfillment. The connections occur both on the
 visual and on the textual level in ways too striking to ignore. “Infant
 Joy” and “Infant Sorrow” delineate contrasting visions of childhood and
 of parenthood. Since&nbsp;the parents’ attitude to their 
parenthood—happiness or dejection—defines and determines the joy or 
sorrow of their children, the poems speak as much about the emotions of 
the children as of the adults.</p>

</div>
“Infant Joy” (illus. 5) is visually linked to <em>The Book of Thel</em> 
through the plant image that forms the center of the design. The same 
flower (anemone pulsatilla), although with different leaves, is used in 
the title page of <em>The Book of Thel</em> (<a href="#1">illus. 1</a>).
 Erdman discerns this similarity and goes on to ask: “And we might 
wonder how Thel would regard the bud (which gets in her way in <em>Thel</em> ii) if she could see the present scene in the open blossom?” (<em>The Illuminated Blake</em>
 66). The anemone in the design has leaves and a stem strongly 
reminiscent of flames, and its blossom is also flame-like. Inside the 
flower Blake depicts three human figures: a mother with a child on her 
knees and a winged female angel. The poem enacts happiness and unity 
both verbally and visually: the stems and the leaves enclose the text 
and culminate in the cup- or womb-like blossom in the upper part of the 
design, which delicately and safely shelters the nativity scene inside. <span class="notecall">The
 position of the mother, tenderly bent over her child, as well as the 
presence of an angel, recalls representations of the Madonna and Christ,
 in accordance with one of the main motifs of <em>Songs of Innocence</em>, where Jesus is said to be identical with every living being, a child in particular.</span><span class="sidenote">This motif recurs in <em>Songs of Innocence</em>: it can be found in “The Lamb,” “The Divine Image,” “On Anothers Sorrow,” and “A Cradle Song.”</span>
 The dialogue that governs the poem testifies to the harmonious 
interaction between the mother and the child. The mother’s question 
“What shall I call thee?” (line 3, E 16) signals receptivity and respect
 toward her newborn child. As a result, sweet joy befalls both of them, 
becoming the child’s name and the mother’s inner state.
<p>The womb-like shape of the flower and the flame and color symbolism 
(the flower in copy C is dark pink, almost purple) suggest the 
possibility that the scene inside the flower imaginatively renders the 
situation prior to the birth, and that the two-day-old child has only 
just been conceived. In this reading, more than ever before, the notion 
of a passionate erotic relationship stands in the background. The child 
is the mother’s joy because it is the fruit of her erotic union with a 
man she loves. She may shelter her baby inside her womb and sing joyful 
lullabies because she herself feels happy and protected inside her 
relationship. Although no masculine element is literally present in the 
poem or in the picture, the presence of the father/partner figure is 
indicated both through the conception of the child and through the unity
 and happiness enacted in the design.&nbsp;</p>

<div>6. “Infant Sorrow,” <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> copy C (1789, 1794). Library of Congress. Image courtesy of the <em><a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/" target="_blank">William Blake Archive</a></em>.</div>
</div>In contrast, “Infant Sorrow” projects a diametrically different 
scene. The loving dialogue between the mother and the child of “Infant 
Joy” is replaced by the woeful monologue of the newborn, who “leap[s]” 
(E 28) into the dangerous world, where nobody is happy about its birth: 
the parents, crying and groaning, give in to dejection and depression. 
The child becomes a devil (a “fiend”), not a joy; it enters a world 
defined by struggle, aggression, and limitation; it struggles in the 
father’s hands and against the swaddling bands, which constrain it and 
make any free movement impossible. Exhausted by the conflict, the child 
gives up and agrees to suck its mother’s milk, but there is no “milky 
fondness,” no happy giving and taking: instead, the breastfed child is 
said to “sulk” upon the mother’s breast. Clearly, there is no joy in 
their mutual relationship, only the baby’s needy hunger and the mother’s
 sense of duty and resignation. As John Bender and Anne Mellor suggest,
<blockquote>Here, the child of innocent energy at first struggles 
against the chains of society and authority. But finally it capitulates,
 persuaded by developing reason that survival lies in accommodating 
oneself to the powers that be—even though such capitulation can only 
produce a life of frustration. The child is fed, but at the price of 
being swaddled and of “sulking.” (301)</blockquote>
Their reading of “Infant Sorrow” is primarily aimed at showing that 
there is a visual/verbal discrepancy between the design and the text, 
undermining the governing concept of the “Sister Arts” (298). The main 
disjunction, as this interpretation suggests, is between the newborn 
baby in the poem, swaddled and oppressed, and the 
one-and-a-half-year-old child in the design (304-05). Another divergence
 can be detected in the mother figure, who&nbsp;“leans forward in a 
pliant arc” with a “soft, tenderly beckoning … gesture” toward her child
 (304). While the absence of the swaddling bands and the different age 
of the child are unmistakable, the gesture code that Blake uses in this 
design seems to echo the title page of <em>The Book of Thel</em>, where 
the couple emerging from the flower are presented in a similar way—one 
of the lovers with hands uplifted in a gesture of alarm, the other 
struggling to grasp and embrace her. It may be concluded, then, that the
 design for “Infant Sorrow” retains ambiguity similar to that in the 
title page for <em>Thel</em>. The child reaches away from the mother, 
communicating an ambivalent attitude toward her embrace, which may be 
perceived as tender or as restricting. Feeling helpless and naked, 
“piping loud” as in the poem, the child finally has no choice, however, 
but to succumb to the mother’s grasp.
<p>It is worth remembering that Thel, upon meeting the infant-Worm, 
describes the baby in almost identical terms: “helpless,” “naked,” and 
“weeping.” Her dilemma can be summarized in the clashing visions of 
motherhood depicted in “Infant Joy” and “Infant Sorrow.” Thel yearns for
 fulfillment as a mother and as a partner similar to that indicated in 
“Infant Joy,” but does not think that such a vision is plausible in the 
world described by her interlocutors. Convinced that in the world of 
Generation motherhood would realize itself as metaphorically presented 
in “Infant Sorrow,” she visualizes herself as an oppressed and unhappy 
mother, who would impose the same pattern of oppression on her baby. 
Since she does not want to become the groaning, grasping figure of 
“Infant Sorrow,” Thel rejects the prospect of erotic love and motherhood
 outright, at least for the time being. Her choice is deeply embedded in
 the question of gender difference in a patriarchal world, presided over
 by a male God who legitimizes the purpose of one’s existence by giving 
meaning to that which “of itself is cold. and of itself is dark” (<em>Thel</em>
 4.12, E 5), where a female has no right to assert her worth if she does
 not fulfill her biological function of childbearing. Instead, Thel 
desires existence in a world where being a mother does not mean solely 
becoming food for worms, where she is allowed to think and ask 
questions, making her own free choices, and where she may expect 
gratitude for all that she has to offer.</p>
<p>Considering the fate of female figures in Blake’s later texts, one 
may feel that Thel’s decision is quite appropriate. Blake presents no 
vision of happy motherhood, and any prospect of a successful 
relationship comes at a high price. If we look at <em>The Book of Thel</em>
 from a feminist viewpoint, this can put other female characters in 
Blake’s poetry into a new perspective. Thus, we have brave, adventurous 
Oothoon in <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em>, who is first 
cruelly mistreated and then severely punished for both her openness and 
her loving nature. Not only is she branded a whore, but she is also made
 to abort her own child as a result of social pressure. Why does she 
decide to perform the abortion? Her urge to “purify” herself in order to
 “deserve” Theotormon is one of her motives, but it is equally likely 
that she cannot face the possibility of becoming an outcast, unwed, 
single mother, nor does she want to be “stampt with my [Bromion’s] 
signet” (<em>Visions</em> 1.21, E 46). In other prophetic books we have Enitharmon, who in <em>The First Book of Urizen</em>
 flees from Los’s embrace but is probably forced into sexual union with 
him, which results in her (unwanted?) pregnancy. The outcome is a 
lifelong struggle for domination, since Enitharmon is not a docile 
character either, but consequently her life is far from happy. She is 
another unfortunate mother in Blake’s poems—together with her child she 
becomes a victim of Los’s (the father’s) jealousy. Orc is just as 
unhappy as the child from “Infant Sorrow”: he is born howling and his 
birth is accompanied by shrieks from all Eternity. Finally, he is bound 
to the rock at the top of the mountain and left there without any 
protection (<em>Urizen</em> 19-20, E 79-80).</p>
<p>Both Oothoon and Enitharmon enact Thel’s dilemma regarding the 
acceptance of the position of a woman in a patriarchal world. They 
plausibly present what might have happened to Thel had she decided to 
enter Generation after all. Oothoon rebels, but succeeds only in 
verbally asserting her position, as the poem ends in stagnation. 
Enitharmon, in turn, is a very ambivalent figure. Married to Los in 
“discontent &amp; scorn” (<em>The Four Zoas</em> 13.19, E 308), she 
lives out her stormy relationship with her partner and generally fights 
for independence but ends up with what we may call militant feminism: 
she establishes the “Womans World” till her creative capacities become 
perverted and she weaves the “triple Female Tabernacle for Moral Law,” 
“That he who loves Jesus may loathe terrified Female love / Till God 
himself become a Male subservient to the Female” (<em>Jerusalem</em> 
88.16-21, E 247). Instead of harmonious, mutually supportive 
relationships and love we mostly have power struggles. Sadly, it seems 
that there are no positive patterns in Blake’s later poetry to follow 
regarding female fulfillment either as an independent woman or in 
relation to others. The best that can happen to females such as Ololon 
and Jerusalem is their total absorption into their male counterpart, 
even if the outcome of this process is deemed glorious and ultimately 
positive. No wonder that this has provoked various statements about 
Blake’s anti-feminist stance; Diane Hoeveler claims that “Blake clearly 
depicts androgyny as a male-centered ideal that exists only through the 
predatory usurpation of the female. <span class="notecall">Unless the 
female willingly sacrifices her existence to the male, he remains a 
spectre, a shadow of his unfallen potential,” and that there is in 
Blake’s poetry “a persistent womb-envy of women as creators, 
life-givers, mothers” (42-43).</span><span class="sidenote">However, 
this comment relates to what Hoeveler terms an “early notion of the 
female as an unequal principle”; according to Hoeveler, later Blake 
turned to viewing women “as equals in recapturing the androgynous ideal”
 (43).</span> Yet it would be a mistake to reduce Blake’s thought to 
everyday categories of gender only. Ultimately, “male” and “female” are 
for him cosmic categories, the forces constituting the essence of 
humanity and the divine Poetic Genius, and this goes way beyond any 
domestic relevance of masculinity and&nbsp;femininity. Since Blake 
believes that the division into sexes is in fact one of the stages of 
the fall from the ideal order prior to the creation of the natural 
world, he also points out that “The Sexual is Threefold: the Human is 
Fourfold” (<em>Milton</em> 4.5, E 97). When, at the end of <em>Milton</em>, he speaks of those
</p><blockquote>Who pretend to Poetry that they may destroy Imagination;<br>
By imitation of Natures Images drawn from Remembrance<br>
These are the Sexual Garments, the Abomination of Desolation<br>
Hiding the Human Lineaments as with an Ark &amp; Curtains<br>
Which Jesus rent: &amp; now shall wholly purge away with Fire<br>
Till Generation is swallowd up in Regeneration (<em>Milton</em> 41[48].23-28, E 142-43)</blockquote>
he figures the sexual garments (it’s irrelevant whether they are male or
 female) as hiding the true essence that lies within. Ultimately, 
“Humanity is far above / Sexual organization”&nbsp;(<em>Jerusalem</em> 79.73-74, E 236).
<p>Bearing in mind the clearly positive and sympathetic attitudes to what we can term female dissent in both <em>The Book of Thel</em> and <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em>,
 we can conclude that some of Blake’s texts openly voice feminist 
concerns and yield well to feminist readings. Blake displays acute 
sensitivity to and awareness of women’s issues, unprecedented among 
other so-called canonical romantic poets. First and foremost, he gives 
his female characters the right of choice—whether to enter a sexual 
relationship and to give birth to a child (Thel), whether openly to 
display her readiness for erotic union and to deny ideology that 
condemns her to ostracism (Oothoon)—even if he does not present 
constructive alternatives to the most socially expected choices. This is
 undoubtedly progressive when we realistically consider the situation of
 women at the end of the eighteenth century. Secondly, and crucially, 
Blake always finds a way to speak from the inside rather than from the 
outside of a dramatic situation that he constructs, which results in a 
non-judgmental stance and multiplies possible interpretations. This 
strategy makes him more akin to Keats’s “chameleon poet” or even 
Rossetti’s “inner standing point” than to Wordsworth’s egotistical 
sublime or Byron’s very personal manner of narration. In <em>The Book of Thel</em> and <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em>,
 the “inner standing point” that Blake assumes is the perspective of the
 oppressed, internally conflicted, and pained woman. His sympathetic 
attitude is a result of his extraordinary psychological insights into 
the human psyche and human relationships, which pervade his poetry from 
the very early texts. <span class="notecall">His interest in the 
individual mind and its internal conflicts and contradictions finds its 
crowning manifestation in his major conception of the four Zoas, which 
is as psychological as it is mythopoeic, but already in such texts as <em>The Book of Thel</em>, <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em>, and <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> Blake shows how perceptive and progressive his awareness of “mind-forg’d manacles” is.</span><span class="sidenote">It
 is hardly surprising, therefore, that there are a number of studies 
tracing parallels between Blake’s thought and ground-breaking 
psychological theories.
