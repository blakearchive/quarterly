          <p>William Blake derived the name and characteristics of his figure Orc from a
                        variety of sources, combining them to produce the various aspects of the
                        character in such poems as <hi rend="i">America, The Four Zoas</hi> and 
<hi rend="i">The Song of Los.</hi> The hellish aspects of Orc probably come
                        from the Latin <hi rend="i">Orcus</hi>, the abode of the dead in Roman
                        mythology and an alternate name for Dis, the god of the underworld. In 
<hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi>, Ijim describes Tiriel’s house, after his
                        sons have expelled him, as “dark as vacant Orcus.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n90" type="note">1</ref> The libidinous aspect of Orc may well
                        come, as David Erdman has suggested, from the Greek ὄρχεις,
                            “testicles.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n91"
type="note">2</ref>
                        “Orcs,” from the Latin <hi rend="i">orca</hi>, “whale,”
                        appear in <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>, a poem much read by Blake, and in
                            <hi rend="i">America</hi> Orc appears symbolically as “sometimes a
                            whale.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n92" type="note">3</ref>
Finally, in
                        Hoole’s version of <hi rend="i">Orlando Furioso</hi>, for which Blake
                        prepared an engraving in 1783, the poet would have noted that “the word
                            <hi rend="i">orca</hi> . . . is applied to any monster or creature of
                        the imagination [and] occurs in Milton.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n93" type="note">4</ref> But Orc also appears as a fiery figure in association with
                        Mount Atlas; these aspects of the figure derive from Jacob Bryant’s
                            <hi rend="i">New System, Or, an Analysis of Ancient Mythology</hi>
                        (first published in 1774), which Blake as a young apprentice may have had a
                        hand in illustrating.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n94"
type="note">5</ref> We know that the
                        poet thought highly of the work, as his remark in the <hi rend="i">Descriptive
Catalogue</hi> makes clear: “The antiquities of every
                        Nation under Heaven, is no less sacred than that of the Jews. They are the
                        same thing, as Jacob Bryant and all antiquaries have proved.”<supplied

          <p>In Bryant’s chapter entitled “Of Ancient Worship, and of
                        Etymological Truths Thence Deducible,” Blake would have found the
                        theory that the Hercynian Forest in Germany gets its name from the Greek
                        δρυμός ὀρχύνιος, “the forest of Orcun.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n96" type="note">7</ref>
                        Bryant goes on to note that at the edge of this forest stands a mountain,
                        the name of which, Pyrene, “signifies a fountain of fire,” because
                        the “mountain had once flamed. . . . The country therefore and the
                        forest may have been called Orcunian upon this account. For as the worship
                        of the Sun, the Deity of fire, prevailed greatly at places of this nature, I
                        make no doubt Hercynia, which Ptolemy expresses ὀρχυνια, was so named from
                        Or-cun, the God of that element.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n97" type="note">8</ref>
                        Bryant goes on to theorize that one of the “Puratheia, or open temples,
                        for the celebration of the rites of fire,” may have stood on Mount
                        Atlas: “This Atlas (of which I have been speaking) is a mountain with a
                        cavity, and of a tolerable height, which the natives esteem both as a
                        temple, and a 
<pb id="p15-199" n="199"/>
Deity.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n98" type="note">9</ref> These passages in Bryant stand as another source of
                        the name of Orc, and may in part lie behind Blake’s assertions that
                        “The cave of Orc stood to the South, a furnace of dire flames,”
                        and that “Orc on Mount Atlas howld, chain’d down with the Chain
                        of Jealousy.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n99"
