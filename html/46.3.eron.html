	<meta name="DC.Description" xml:lang="en" content="  The Book of Urizen  as a rewriting, or reinterpretation, of the Genesis myth has long been important to Blake studies in terms of understanding the very crux of Blakean mythology and the nature of what has come to be known as Blake&amp;rsquo;s bible. By essentially reading the act of &amp;ldquo;genesis&amp;rdquo; (what one might normally associate with an establishment of order and origin) as a kind of reverse creation myth, Blake suggests in  Urizen  that the birth of humanity emerges at the moment of its fall. Hence, what was once a story of creation out of chaos becomes for Blake a visionary apocalypse. I use the term &amp;ldquo;visionary&amp;rdquo; here not simply because  Urizen  acts as Blake&amp;rsquo;s artistic vision of man&amp;rsquo;s genesis, but because, for Blake, the nature of our origins as apocalypse is dependent upon the fall of our perceptions, on a collapse of both human and divine vision.&amp;nbsp; If the Blakean fall predates an exile of humanity from paradise, then it becomes divine in origin, stemming from acts of godly creation. Blake&amp;rsquo;s radical mythology essentially can be read as a critique of aesthetics and of our standards of both divine and artistic creation. We know from the original Genesis myth that divine creation arises out of God&amp;rsquo;s command &amp;ldquo;Let there be light.&amp;rdquo; However, Blake&amp;rsquo;s anti-Genesis begins and ends in obscurity, in a world devoid of light that remains in darkness throughout all of Urizen&amp;rsquo;s acts of creation. Therefore, we can read  The Book of Urizen  as a story of blindness, or of the relationship that emerges between man and God as both lose their ability to perceive fully. ">

<p class="title">“Bound ... by their narrowing perceptions”: Sympathetic Bondage and Perverse Pity in Blake’s<br> <em>The Book of Urizen</em></p>
<p class="byline">By Sarah Eron</p>
<p class="note"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sarah Eron</span> (<a href="mailto:sarah.eron@gmail.com">sarah.eron@gmail.com</a>)
 is an assistant professor of English at the University of Rhode Island.
 She has published articles in a number of journals and online 
publications on issues of language and aesthetics, time and form, and 
gender and genre in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature and 
philosophy. She is currently completing a book manuscript on inspiration
 in the early eighteenth century.</p>

<div id="text">
<p class="first"><em>The Eye sees more than the Heart knows</em><span class="notecall"></span><span class="sidenote">Blake, <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em>, title page (Johnson and Grant 70; all citations of Blake’s poems are from this edition, unless otherwise specified).</span></p>
<p><em>The Book of Urizen</em> as a rewriting, or reinterpretation, of 
the Genesis myth has long been important to Blake studies in terms of 
understanding the very crux of Blakean mythology and the nature of what 
has come to be known as <span class="notecall">Blake’s bible.</span><span class="sidenote">See, in particular, David Worrall’s introduction to <em>The Urizen Books</em>. He describes <em>The Book of Urizen</em> as Blake’s effort to ask “when, why and how man’s ideas of God and religion came into existence” (10).</span>
 By essentially reading the act of “genesis” (what one might normally 
associate with an establishment of order and origin) as a kind of 
reverse creation myth, Blake suggests in <em>Urizen</em> that the birth 
of humanity emerges at the moment of its fall. Hence, what was once a 
story of creation out of chaos becomes for Blake a visionary apocalypse.
 I use the term “visionary” here not simply because <em>Urizen</em> acts
 as Blake’s artistic vision of man’s genesis, but because, for Blake, 
the nature of our origins as apocalypse is dependent upon the fall of 
our perceptions, on a collapse of both human and divine vision.&nbsp; If
 the Blakean fall predates an exile of humanity from paradise, then it 
becomes divine in origin, stemming from acts of godly creation. Blake’s 
radical mythology essentially can be read as a critique of aesthetics 
and of our standards of both divine and artistic creation. We know from 
the original Genesis myth that divine creation arises out of God’s 
command “Let there be light.” However, Blake’s anti-Genesis begins and 
ends in obscurity, in a world devoid of light that remains in darkness 
throughout all of Urizen’s acts of creation. Therefore, we can read <em>The Book of Urizen</em> as a story of blindness, or of the relationship that emerges between man and God as both lose their ability to perceive fully.
</p>
<p>Of course, Blake’s preoccupation with sight extends beyond his biblical poems. In turning to an analysis of <em>Urizen</em>, we might recall the opening epigraph on the title page of <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em>,
 “The Eye sees more than the Heart knows.” Here, Blake plays with our 
concept of vision by destabilizing the traditional association of sight 
with knowledge. If the language of prophecy is dependent upon foresight,
 a knowledge that stems from visionary perception, then the eye’s 
perceptions might dictate the knowledge of the mind or heart. However, 
in <em>Visions</em> Blake suggests that we see <em>more</em> than we 
know, or, in other words, we never internalize all of our perceptions. 
This is a phenomenon that can be explained through the narrative of 
Urizenic genesis, a myth that seeks to unfold the story of man’s 
emergence into a world of “narrowing perceptions.” More importantly, in 
the epigraph for <em>Visions</em>, it is not the <em>mind </em>that knows, but rather it is the <em>heart</em>
 that becomes the primary organ of thought. Thus Blake associates 
feeling with thinking. Ironically, the heart, an organ that comes to 
represent feeling as thinking, also fails to feel and/or think 
adequately through acts of visionary perception. Why then does Blake 
perceive the heart as blind? This is a question that can be explained in
 light of <em>Urizen</em>.</p>
<p>Once we understand <em>The Book of Urizen</em> as dependent upon a 
narrative of thwarted perceptions, we note the immediate connection 
between Urizen, or “your reason,” and a critique of En<em>light</em>enment
 thinking. At the center of Blake’s dark conception of the Enlightenment
 lies an eighteenth-century preoccupation with sentiment, and thus we 
begin to see how Blake’s critique of reason ties into matters of the 
heart. Moreover, we begin to associate <em>Urizen</em>, a book that 
links allegorical reason to divine creation and thereby to ideologies of
 genesis and origin, with eighteenth-century philosophies of the self. 
Both the ontological and aesthetic implications of the poem shed light 
on Blake’s ongoing desire to expose the hypocrisy of eighteenth-century 
theories of sensibility, a topic that a number of Blake critics, James 
Chandler and Stephen Cox in particular, have begun to explore in their 
work.</p>
<p>I would like to argue, more specifically, that we can read <em>The Book of Urizen</em>
 as Blake’s commentary on the moral and structural failings of sympathy,
 a phenomenon associated with philosophies of sensibility and one that 
Blake sees as an identificatory process that tricks the imagination into
 false perception. Hence, we can account for the strong relationship in 
the poem between sight and the cognitive dissonances that arise out of a
 Blakean conception of pity. In particular, I would like to read Blake’s
 critique of pity in <em>The Book of Urizen</em>, which critics such as 
Cox have connected with issues of division in the poem, as standing in 
direct opposition to eighteenth-century theories of sympathy found in 
Humean and Smithian moral philosophies of subjectivity and aesthetic 
judgment.&nbsp; In other words, for Blake, sympathy as a sentiment that 
distorts or tricks our real perceptions is perverse in that it creates 
only imagined, or illusory, union. By striving for conformity, sympathy 
ultimately blinds us, creating only division and solipsism where it 
seeks to unite. Thus Blake’s world of “narrowing perceptions” at the end
 of the poem is the result not only of Urizenic genesis but of a kind of
 creation that arises out of man’s distorted perception, out of a 
paradoxical “pity” that Blake reads as man’s perverse desire to seek for
 himself in others by simultaneously likening himself to and distancing 
himself from them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ironically, the identificatory desire to unite to another subject 
results for Blake only in a doubling of the self, in a mimetic 
self-reproduction reliant on projection. Blake’s Urizenic world is 
founded upon sympathy, upon the mirrorings of the self, which seeks to 
find itself, reproduce itself, in everything. Although the Urizenic 
world is one that begins in isolation, with the creator brooding on his 
own, Urizen ultimately creates a society founded on the laws of “unity,”
 “pity, compassion, [and] forgiveness” (4.34-35). Thus Urizen’s world 
defies the Blakean ideals of individualism by seeking for itself in 
others, by imagining unity where none exists, and thereby creating only 
nonproductive mimesis and division.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critics have long acknowledged Blake’s critique of pity in the <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>: <span class="notecall">“Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody Poor” (“The Human Abstract”).</span><span class="sidenote">The other representation of pity that has occupied Blake critics over time is the color print <em>Pity</em>, which is analyzed by David Bindman in <em>William Blake: His Art and Times</em>. The design has been interpreted as illustrative of the following lines from Shakespeare’s <em>Macbeth</em>:<br>
<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin-left: 10px">And pity, like a naked new-born babe,</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin-left: 10px">Striding the blast, or heaven’s cherubim hors’d</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin-left: 10px">Upon the sightless couriers of the air</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin-left: 10px">Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin-left: 10px">That tears shall drown the wind.</span><br>
Bindman relates the conceptions of pity in <em>The Book of Urizen</em> to the allegorical design, arguing that in both pity appears as a negative emotion, which in <em>Urizen</em>
 arises out of Los’s pity for Urizen. Pity causes Los’s division (into 
the two sexes) and the consequent separation of Enitharmon and Los 
(115-16).</span> An anxiety about the repression of sensory perception also pervades the <em>Songs</em>, most particularly “To Tirzah,” which shares with <em>Urizen</em> the apocalyptic fear that emerges from a binding of the senses. Nevertheless, my focus in this essay will be on <em>The Book of Urizen</em>, for two reasons. First, critics have focused less on the topic of sympathy in <em>Urizen</em> than in Blake’s other poetry, and, second, <em>Urizen</em>
 as Blake’s rewriting of the Genesis myth specifically critiques 
theories of sympathy because of their connection to mimetic models of 
thinking, perceiving, and creating.</p>
<p>In this manner, Blake’s critique of sympathy in <em>The Book of Urizen</em>
 most likely arises out of the aesthetic and subjective issues that stem
 from eighteenth-century conceptions of sympathy and the self. His 
critique focuses upon both the social consequences of sympathy and the 
philosophical rhetoric and structure that empiricists use to describe 
acts of sympathetic identification. If we turn, for example, to some of 
the major philosophies of sympathy in Blake’s time, we see that at the 
heart of this discourse lies a larger implication for both aesthetics 
and the psychology of the individual, an implication that stands in 
direct conflict with some of Blake’s own moral preoccupations. One of 
Blake’s greatest issues with sympathy as theorized in the late 
eighteenth century is that it is founded upon a false sense of unity, on
 an imagined, as opposed to a real, psychological bond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most importantly, this imagined connection relies upon a restriction 
of the senses, or rather a relationship in which thought, or reason, 
supersedes sensory perception. In his <em>Treatise of Human Nature</em>,
 Hume foregrounds his commentary on the imaginative work of sympathy by 
discussing the relationship between sensation and reason, or what he 
calls “impressions” and “ideas”:
</p><blockquote>All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves
 into two distinct kinds, which I shall call IMPRESSIONS and IDEAS. The 
difference betwixt these consists in the degrees of force and 
liveliness, with which they strike upon the mind, and make their way 
into our thought or consciousness. Those perceptions, which enter with 
most force and violence, we may name <em>impressions</em>; and under 
this name I comprehend all our sensations, passions and emotions, as 
they make their first appearance in the soul. By <em>ideas</em> I mean the faint images of these in thinking and reasoning …. (7)</blockquote>
For Hume, an “impression” is a kind of perception that is also a 
sensation, an act of vision that instantly gives rise to a bodily, 
emotional reaction. An “idea,” on the other hand, not only becomes a 
conceptualization, or a memory, of our impression, but also a mimesis of
 this impression. “When I shut my eyes and think of my chamber,” Hume 
writes, “the ideas I form are exact <em>representations</em> of the 
impressions I felt …” (8). Therefore, for Hume, there is something 
inherently mimetic about thinking; our ideas are replicas of our 
reality, and what is real is primarily based upon both sight and sensory
 experience. Moreover, Hume states that “in sympathy there is an evident
 conversion of an idea into an impression” (208). Thus Hume illustrates a
 chain of mimetic responses in which impressions become ideas and ideas 
become impressions. Affections such as sympathy, he argues, rely less 
upon an immediate sensory experience than they do on the faculties of 
our memory and imagination. Sympathy as a kind of affection becomes a 
function of the imagination. We feel sympathy, argues Hume, not through 
direct sensory experience but from a faint mimesis, a recollection, of 
our former sensations. This is to say that sympathetic bonds arise not 
from sensory perceptions but from the reproductive, mimetic work of the 
mind.
<p>Smith explains the imaginative nature of sympathy through a similar 
rhetoric. Here, we can further grasp why sympathy as an affective bond 
with another being must rely upon the mimetic faculties of the mind 
rather than upon any direct or immediate sensation:
</p><blockquote>Though our brother is upon the rack, as long as we 
ourselves are at ease, our senses will never inform us of what he 
suffers. They never did, and never can, carry us beyond our own person, 
and it is by the imagination only that we can form any conception of 
what are his sensations. Neither can that faculty help us to this any 
other way, than by representing to us what would be our own, if we were 
in his case. It is the impressions of our own senses only, not those of 
his, which our imaginations copy. (<em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em> 11-12)</blockquote>
We cannot, according to Smith, directly experience the emotions of another person. <span class="notecall">In
 order to experience those emotions in acts of sympathy, we place a map 
of our former impressions and sensations onto another subject.</span><span class="sidenote">According to Chandler in “Blake and the Syntax of Sentiment,” <em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em> argues that to sympathize with a person is “<em>not</em>
 to feel what that person feels,” but “rather to feel what we ourselves 
should feel in a like situation.” In this manner, sympathy relates to 
performance. When we sympathize, we “feel what it would be <em>like</em>
 to be that person,” and thus we enter into that person’s state or 
situation by way of imitation (106). However, Chandler argues, to put 
oneself into the case of another “requires a … remediation of oneself in
 relation to all that is not oneself” (107). This includes one’s body. 
When we pity, we imagine a virtual set of circumstances with which to 
identify; thus pity becomes “an act of disembodiment and (at the same 
time) of virtual reembodiment.” “Thus to become an object of sympathetic
 identification,” Chandler writes, “is to have one’s experience mediated
 in two related senses” (107), between “the universal and the 
particular,” and “rendered” so as to admit “virtual” and imaginative 
experience. For Blake, Chandler claims, sympathy is not a matter of 
sympathetic imagination, i.e., of putting oneself into the case of 
another, or imagining what it would be like to be them. Rather, he 
argues that for Blake sympathy becomes a matter of characters 
“metamorphosing into one another” (112). According to Chandler, Blake 
attempts to “denaturalize the level of habitual reflection and exchange 
that marks the sentimental” (116).<br>
Here is where I wish to depart from Chandler’s analysis. His model seeks
 to establish a Blakean ideal for sympathy, whereas I read <em>Urizen</em>
 as an outright argument against the evils of sympathetic 
identification. There is no need, Blake seems to say, to eradicate 
difference, a desire that seems to lie at the heart of the late 
eighteenth-century’s preoccupation with sensibility. <em>The Book of Urizen</em>, I argue, rejects Smithian sympathy as a form of self-doubling or projection.</span>
 Smithian sympathy is necessarily reliant on imaginative projection; the
 sympathizer tries to conform the experiences of the sympathetic object 
to his own in order to establish a sense of likeness. Such a case would 
point not to an imaginative transport <em>into</em> the object but rather to a kind of imaginative projection <em>onto</em>
 the object of one’s pity. For Smith, not only is sympathy a function of
 the imagination, but it acts as a repetition of the self; it relies on 
mimesis. We can see how for Blake this mimetic aspect of sympathy might 
appear solipsistic. If we were to read Smith via, or in conjunction 
with, Hume, then sympathy might look like a doubly mimetic process; in 
sympathy, we take an idea, a replica of an initial impression that we 
experienced in the past, in an attempt to mimic the unknown sentiments 
of another. Thus the sympathetic bond describes an act of mimetic 
mapping; a doubly reproduced sensation creates an illusory connection. 
In contrast to the image-making faculties of Blakean creation or 
thought, eighteenth-century theories of sympathy thereby define the 
imagination as something that never creates but only reproduces or 
copies sensation. This notion seems to highlight the generally 
solipsistic nature of a work like <em>The Book of Urizen</em>, which is, as many critics have argued, dependent upon narcissistic forms of reproduction, <span class="notecall">on “a continual reproduction of selfhood,” as Paul Mann states.</span><span class="sidenote">Mann 56.</span>
<p>For Blake, it is the mimetic properties of sympathy, along with its connection to the mind, <span class="notecall">the imagination, and the self, that violate an artistic code of originality and a moral paradigm of individualism.</span><span class="sidenote">This
 vision of sympathy for Blake as an “imagined” or “thought-constructed” 
act that gives rise to division where it intends to unite becomes 
further emphasized in his use of the term “pity.” Pity as a type of 
sympathy only emphasizes a need for difference as well as hierarchy in 
order to produce an illusory feeling of likeness. See Smith’s definition
 of pity as closely aligned with the nature of sympathy, but exclusive 
to feelings of sorrow or misery (Smith 13). According to Smith, 
therefore, we can read pity as a mere subclassification of sympathy, 
which is how I intend to use this term with regard to Blake. Finally, 
note also Hume’s definition of pity (Hume 238-40). For Hume, pity, like 
sympathy, functions as an imaginative faculty, not a real bond or 
likeness, which is (as in Smith’s analysis of sympathy) triggered by <em>sight</em> and therefore connected to our powers of thought and perception.</span> <span class="notecall">The
 threat of a Humean or Smithian conception of sympathy connected to the 
mimetic faculties of the imagination could only disturb any Blakean 
ideals of originality and individual subjectivity as seen in both his 
poetry and his method of printing.</span><span class="sidenote">See Joseph Viscomi’s article <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/biography.xq?b=illum&amp;targ_div=d1" target="_blank">“Illuminated Printing”</a> from the <em><a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/" target="_blank">William Blake Archive</a></em>,
 in which he describes the unique process behind Blake’s method of 
printing. For the aesthetic implications behind Blake’s artistic 
process, see also <a href="#Marriage">note 29</a>.</span> Thus Blake represents sympathy in <em>The Book of Urizen</em>
 as a reproduction of the self that breeds division in its attempt to 
unite. Moreover, the Urizenic mind must reproduce its own past 
sensations, must essentially form a double of itself that is then 
projected outward, <em>divided</em> from the self, in order to create the sympathetic bond.</p>
<p>Late eighteenth-century philosophers of sympathy link it to 
spectatorship, arguing that sight always triggers sympathetic reactions;
 thus our perceptions become a key aspect of all acts of sympathetic 
bonding. Hume classifies “impressions” and “ideas” as “perceptions of 
the … mind” and therefore suggests that sympathy acts as a hybrid 
idea-impression, as a function of the imagination and as a kind of 
perception. For Smith, the sympathetic plight of the spectator arises 
out of a visual perception of a situation that triggers an emotional 
response that intends to capture or mimic the would-be emotions of the 
sympathetic object. Blake acknowledges this aspect of the sympathetic 
discourse when he places recurrent emphasis throughout <em>The Book of Urizen</em>
 on images and acts of perception. Even the very first word of the poem 
(after its Preludium) serves as a perfect introduction to the importance
 of sight in the narrative of Urizen’s material genesis: “<em>Lo</em>, a
 shadow of horror is risen / In Eternity! Unknown, unprolific?” (3.1-2; 
emphasis mine). “Lo” here, of course, can mean “low” as in something 
base, dark, and obscure rising upward. <span class="notecall">However, we could also read “Lo” as a kind of elided articulation of the phrase “lo and behold.”</span><span class="sidenote">“Lo”
 can also be read as a pun on the name and figure of Los in the poem. In
 “The Meaning of Los,” Edward J. Rose argues that “Los” should be 
interpreted as the “traditionally shortened form of the interjection, 
‘lo.’” In this sense, we should read the name of Los, who fittingly 
becomes the figure of the prophet in Blake’s <em>Urizen</em>, as meaning to “‘look’ or ‘behold’” (10).</span>
 Thus the poem immediately asks us to see, to behold, this vision; it 
places Urizen in the position of something viewed, an object awaiting 
sympathy. To some extent, Urizen already loses a kind of individual 
agency here, even as a divine power. Not only does Blake figure him in 
the first stanza as a spectacle that calls forth our attention, but he 
also describes Urizen as essentially “unknown.” Urizen becomes known 
only to the extent that he is called “Urizen”: “Some said / ‘It is 
Urizen’” (3.5-6).</p>
<p>In this initial act of naming, Blake emphasizes our desire, or the 
desire of the Eternals, to comprehend Urizen through a strained act of 
perception. Here, Blake acknowledges the assumption that seeing is 
knowing, and that an assumed piece of knowledge always leads to a 
secondary desire: one of naming, defining, and incidentally <em>confining</em>
 the unknown. This points to the very predicament of the original 
Genesis myth, in which speaking and naming (in terms of both God’s 
declarative <em>fiat lux</em> and Adam’s status as he who names all 
things) become essential to the process of material creation. The 
paradox here, of course, lies in Blake’s and the Eternals’ asking us to 
see something that has no material form, for at the opening of the poem 
the concept of Urizen exists in a pre-Genesis state of chaos. Urizen is 
unshapen, a void, an essence, something, therefore, “unseen” and 
“unknown” (3.10), which already indicates our desire to “see,” to 
“know,” and to sympathize with him. Los becomes in the poem the “Eternal
 Prophet” and thus the ultimate “seer.” Incidentally, it is Los too who 
as seer, and as craftsman or creator, will play the role of the 
quintessential sympathizer, reproducing, producing, dividing, and 
creating throughout his continual acts of pity. Hence, the opening of 
the poem poses a threat of perception, which foreshadows a subsequent 
threat of sympathetic bondage for Blake.</p>
<p><span class="notecall">Notably, we exit the pre-genesis state of 
Urizen and fall into materiality only when he introduces “Laws of peace,
 of love, of unity” into creation,</span><span class="sidenote">Cox 
reads Urizen’s desire to put into effect “Laws of peace, of love, of 
unity: / Of pity, compassion, forgiveness” as Urizen’s establishment of 
the rules of sensibility. He argues that Los’s attempt to limit Urizen 
involves him in a Urizenic excess of sensibility. When Los observes 
Urizen, pity divides his soul. Blake, states Cox, is “aware of the 
overcompensating element in the eighteenth century’s ability to generate
 an ethic of sympathy from its fear of solipsism.” Thus, when Los 
experiences sympathy for Urizen, this creates a division, an anguish of 
being rent from Urizen’s side. Sympathy in <em>The Book of Urizen</em> thus acts as a “failed attempt to use feeling for others to recover from a perceived absence of those others” (153-54).</span>
 an act that Blake describes as a darkness unfolding (4.31-35). Hence, 
sympathy becomes an event of false enlightenment, a Miltonic fall into 
“darkness visible.” <span class="notecall">Stanzas 8 and 9 of chapter 3 
connect this notion of sensual bondage to sympathy with the introduction
 of Los, a formerly silent bystander who intervenes and emerges in 
accordance with his role as the sympathetic spectator:</span><span class="sidenote">According to Harold Bloom, pity enters into <em>The Book of Urizen</em>
 through the character of Los, whose dismay at the disaster suffered 
through Urizen’s solipsistic intellect prompts him to action. Urizen, 
when contemplating his creation, “weeps hypocritical tears of abstract 
pity.” His weeping is thus akin to the mercy of a destructive God. “As 
in ‘The Human Abstract,’” Urizenic pity “breeds monstrous growth,” 
argues Bloom (174).</span>
</p><blockquote>And Los round the dark globe of Urizen<br>
Kept watch for Eternals to confine<br>
The obscure separation alone;<br>
For Eternity stood wide apart,<br>
As the stars are apart from the earth.<br>
<br>
Los wept howling around the dark Demon:<br>
And cursing his lot; for in anguish,<br>
Urizen was rent from his side. (5.38-41; 6.1-4)</blockquote>
Los’s immediate perception, or prophecy, arises from his role as 
Urizen’s guardian. (We might compare Los here to the Miltonic angel or 
demon who keeps watch.) This initial perception both predicts and 
reifies Urizen’s confinement. <span class="notecall">In the horrifying spectacle of Urizen’s creation,</span><span class="sidenote">Morton D. Paley argues in “Spectre and Emanation” that Los’s endeavor to save Albion in <em>Jerusalem</em>
 is actually an endeavor “to reintegrate his … spectre with his 
emanation” (150). Again, we see a problematic between internality and 
externality in Blake. What represents external relations may also 
represent internal struggles and relations. Thus the nerves and fibers 
of the Urizenic origin create a world with very few boundaries, which 
through a solipsistic form of creation exists as a kind of universality,
 a connective tissue that unites and binds the individual to himself and
 to his surroundings.</span> his markedly demonic and solipsistic 
separation, Blake introduces Los as the perpetuator of separation and 
division in the poem. Los’s “pity” for Urizen separates the two. Just as
 Urizen’s laws of pity force him to divide from the Eternals, Los’s 
sentiments of sympathy divide him from Urizen. Hence, Blake begins to 
establish a concrete relationship between pity and division: <span class="notecall">“Los wept howling around the dark Demon: / And cursing his lot; for in anguish, / Urizen was rent from his side” (6.2-4).</span><span class="sidenote">Worrall
 argues that “Los is ‘rent’ from Urizen’s side in a way analogous to 
Eve’s division from Adam. … Los then subdivides into a female form 
(Enitharmon)” (10). See also <a href="#Ostriker">note 19</a>.</span> 
Despite Los’s lamentations, Urizen remains a formless mass that, divided
 from the Eternals and Los, is “Unorganiz’d, rent from Eternity” 
(6.8).&nbsp; Nonetheless, the image or sight of an “unorganiz’d” Urizen 
only increases Los’s pity. These lamentations eventually heal Los 
himself, although they fail to heal Urizen: “Los howld in a dismal 
stupor, / Groaning! gnashing! groaning! / Till the wrenching apart was 
healed. / But the wrenching of Urizen heal’d not” (7.1-4). Such a 
representational analysis of pity recalls what Blake sees as the 
self-serving, self-projecting forces of a Smithian conception of 
sympathy. In Blake’s world, the consequences of sympathy result only in a
 self-mimetic, solipsistic form of materialization in which the 
sympathizer “forms” the other subject out of the substance of his own 
sentiment. As Urizen “heal[s] not” and Los’s pity is again aroused, 
sympathy leads to the formation of Urizen’s body, a binding of his 
previously formless senses. Such an ending to chapter 3 is not 
surprising, since Blake intends to reveal pity as a self-serving emotion
 that never succeeds in healing or helping the object of one’s sympathy.
 Not only, therefore, do Los’s sympathetic lamentations create division,
 but they also facilitate the fall of the Urizenic world into 
materiality.
<p><span class="notecall">Chapter 3 concludes with a petrific image of 
Los’s horror at the sight of Urizen, a vision that forms the basis of 
the illustration on plate 7 (illus. 1),</span><span class="sidenote">For
 a substantial analysis of the imagery of these plates, see Worrall’s 
“Themes and Contexts” (32-34; pls. 6 and 7 in copy D, reproduced in 
Worrall).</span> which concludes with the lines “Till Los rouz’d his fires, affrighted / At the formless unmeasurable death” (7.8-9).

Here Blake depicts Los surrounded by fire and in an enclosed, womb-like 
posture, with his circular mouth open. In this position, Los binds his 
own body, with his arms overlapped and intertwined in front of his 
chest. Chapter 4 then begins with the formation of Urizen’s skeletal 
structure. Fittingly, the image on plate 8 of Urizen’s new body (illus. 
2) seems to mirror the image of Los on plate 7.

</div>
Blake depicts the bones that Los shapes and binds into “nets &amp; gins”
 (in order to embody Urizen) as a skeleton encircled in a fetal 
position, suggestive of rebirth but also of the womb-like position as a 
kind of enclosure. Even the words on plates 7 and 8 suggest a kind of 
bondage, with vines (or veins) circling the text of the poem like its 
own etched “nets &amp; gins.” Notably, Blake figures Los, the Eternal 
Prophet, as a craftsman whose creation acts as a mimesis of himself. <span class="notecall">Blake thus critiques the association of creation with imitation,</span><span class="sidenote">Mann and David Simpson connect this mimetic process of regeneration and creation to the masturbatory language that abounds in <em>The Book of Urizen</em>.
 Christopher Hobson accounts for Blake’s views on masturbation in 
conjunction with his views on narcissistic/mimetic reproduction as 
fitting with those of his time. Masturbation, Hobson argues, is 
condemned as a form of non-reproductive sexuality, as something that 
generates nothing, or at least nothing new (39).</span> particularly in 
relation to the original Genesis myth, which highlights God’s desire to 
create man in his own image. Most importantly, when Los creates, or 
forms, Urizen’s body, he does so out of an act of pity. Thus Urizen’s 
embodiment once again narrates a Smithian theory of sympathy as Los 
projects himself onto the object of his pity. Urizen becomes a 
supposedly new conception of thought, which is actually derived from a 
double (or division) of Los’s own self. Here, the imagination as a 
creative faculty serves only to reproduce and mimic but never to create 
anew. <span class="notecall">Essentially, the formation of Urizen’s body
 becomes a narrative of sensual bondage that critiques 
eighteenth-century theories of sympathy as they relate to new, 
philosophical conceptions of reason and its relationship to aesthetics.</span><span class="sidenote">When
 I use the term “aesthetic” here, I refer to its eighteenth-century use 
as a “feeling,” sentiment, or “affect.” See definition 1 in the <em>OED</em>, which associates the aesthetic with “sensuous perception.”</span>
 The changes that Urizen experiences in the binding of his senses can be
 read as an eighteenth-century triumph of ideas over impressions <span class="notecall">(or a Kantian departure from empiricism)</span><span class="sidenote">See Kant’s account of the sublime in the second book of the first part of the <em>Critique of the Power of Judgment</em>.</span>
 in which the awakening of reason attempts to make up for the 
restriction of the senses. Urizen’s embodiment indicates the 
anti-empirical formation of a new world conception of reason in which 
thought separates from sensory experience. Thus Blake emphasizes 
Urizen’s “eternal name” as though this original name has been perverted 
somehow with the changes of “U<em>rizen</em>.”
<p>In the new world of Urizen, reason is now misinterpreted for Blake as
 something connected to pity and the laws of sympathy or affect:
</p><blockquote>And Urizen (so his eternal name)<br>
His prolific delight obscurd more &amp; more<br>
In dark secresy, hiding in surgeing<br>
Sulphureous fluid his phantasies.<br>
The Eternal Prophet heavd the dark bellows,<br>
And turn’d restless the tongs; and the hammer<br>
Incessant beat; forging chains new &amp; new,<br>
Numb’ring with links, hours, days &amp; years. (10.11-18)</blockquote>
Here, Urizen struggles against Los’s desire to bind and embody him by 
continually attempting to hide his self, or his “phantasies,” in 
“sulphureous fluid.” The “sulphureous fluid” implies images both of 
masturbation and of the amniotic fluid of Urizen’s rebirth, but it also 
emphasizes fluidity as indicative of formlessness. We recall the opening
 to <em>The Book of Urizen</em>, when Urizen as free-floating sensation is defined by his lack of form.
<p>In this stanza we also see the creation of time, which Los fashions 
in the image of a chain. Thus temporality, like materiality, for Blake 
indicates a kind of bondage definitive of the earthly, human world. Los 
not only forges temporality by dividing it into the subdivisions of 
hours, days, and years, thereby associating creation with mimesis or 
division, but he also “numb’r[s]” the divisions like the links on a 
chain. Blake’s use of the word “numb’ring,” in which he elides the “e,” 
creates a pun on the act of counting. The forging, or material bondage, 
of time not only indicates Los’s attempt to number and divide, but also 
points to the numbing (“numb-ring”) of sensory experience. Hence, Blake 
reiterates in Los’s act of creative division a triumph of ratiocination 
over sensation, a war in which the logic of time overrides empirical 
being through a stifling of the senses.</p>
<p>Plates 11-13 continue to associate “numb-ring,” or measuring, with 
the numbing of sensory experience. Here, time is measured out in the 
seven ages of “dismal woe” that all arise with the stages of Urizen’s 
literal embodiment. Once again, his formation is figured as a binding of
 sensory perception. Perhaps the most significant age of sensory bondage
 is the third, which illustrates the material creation of Urizen’s eyes:
</p><blockquote>His nervous brain shot branches<br>
Round the branches of his heart<br>
On high into two little orbs<br>
And fixed in two little caves<br>
Hiding carefully from the wind,<br>
His Eyes beheld the deep,<br>
And a third Age passed over:<br>
And a state of dismal woe. (11.11-18)</blockquote>
Blake’s depiction of the eyes recalls both the opening assertion of <em>Visions</em>,
 in which “the Eye sees more than the Heart knows,” and a Humean account
 of sympathy. In Blake’s description, the branches of the brain strangle
 and bind the branches of the heart. Thus we encounter a Blakean 
critique of Hume’s theories of affect and perception. Such eyes that 
“hid[e] carefully from the wind” are modeled after a notion of 
perception derived from reason’s attempt to perform the work of the 
heart: hence Hume’s conception of affect as an idea that mimics (so as 
to become) impression. As the senses attempt and yet fail to branch out,
 or break free, from Urizen’s bodily bondage, the formation of ears, 
eyes, nostrils, a throat and tongue gives rise to new phases “of dismal 
woe”; thus the senses embodied become eras that indicate the triumph of 
“your reason” over sensual perception. The association of measurement 
and “numb-ring” with sensual bondage indicates that Urizen’s fall into 
materiality becomes a fall from sensory perception into an idea-based 
type of perception, or, more specifically, a fall into judgment.
<p><span class="notecall">Smith chooses to associate judgment, a cognitive discernment of difference,</span><span class="sidenote">See <em>OED</em>, “judgment,” definition 9b. See also Locke’s definition of judgment in <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> (156).</span> with sympathy, <span class="notecall">an affection that attempts to establish likeness.</span><span class="sidenote">See <em>OED</em>, “sympathy,” definitions 1 and 2.</span>
 Blake recognizes an association between measurement and judgment, 
aligning Urizen’s embodiment with a critique of the sympathetic 
discourse. Consequently, he sees Urizen’s fall into materiality and 
Los’s fall into sympathy as incidents that create division as opposed to
 unity. In this case, the senses divide, or become separated from the 
external world. Therefore, Los’s sympathy, his attempt to create 
likeness, divides Urizen from his surroundings, forcing him to perceive 
the world through difference (judgment) as opposed to unity, and thereby
 inhibiting his true ability to see clearly. Judgment and measurement 
for Blake thus become inadequate methods of perception that are linked 
more to our faculties of “reason” than to our sensory organs.</p>
<p>In separating him from the external world, Urizen’s embodiment thus “narrow[s]” his “perceptions”:
</p><blockquote>All the myriads of Eternity:<br>
All the wisdom &amp; joy of life:<br>
Roll like a sea around him,<br>
Except what his little orbs<br>
Of sight by degrees unfold. (13.28-32)</blockquote>
Again, Blake describes Urizen’s eyes as little sensory windows into the 
world from which he is isolated, confined, and bounded by his corporeal 
prison. In a world dictated and created by sympathy, sight still remains
 necessary, particularly as a faculty that triggers sympathetic 
reactions. Urizen’s “narrow[ed] perceptions” also invoke a Humean 
conception of perception, divided into impressions and ideas. If 
Urizen’s eyes are the only part of him that can “by degrees” allow him 
to perceive (or sensually experience) the world, then he must rely on 
his faculties of thought, on his “ideas” (which mimic his few past 
impressions) in order to relate to the world that he has been divided 
from. Thus Urizen’s sight, his vision of the world, depends upon a new 
kind of reason that restricts and narrows sensual perception and 
experience.
<p>Urizen’s embodiment, therefore, results from an act of sympathy and 
in turn makes him susceptible to sympathetic perception. The laws of 
sympathy thereby produce an inescapable cycle of sympathetic relations 
as Urizen’s fall into materiality breeds further actions and reactions 
of pity. For example, once Los abandons his labors, he becomes bound to 
Urizen as a result of his sympathetic desire for unity: “The Eternal 
Prophet &amp; Urizen clos’d” (13.40). This state of bondage can be read 
as a direct result of the psychological process of sympathy. Falling 
prey to an endless cycle of mimetic reproduction, Los creates Urizen in 
his likeness (a result of sympathetic projection) and in turn becomes 
united to Urizen in sympathetic bondage. Upon experiencing the 
consequences of his sympathetic desires, Los looks back on an undivided 
eternity, only to feel the sublime image striking “horror into his soul”
 (13.47). Such sublimity, inspiring a desire for unity, thus prompts Los
 to further acts of pity and division:
</p><blockquote>Los wept, obscur’d with mourning:<br>
His bosom earthquak’d with sighs;<br>
He saw Urizen deadly black,<br>
In his chains bound, &amp; Pity began,<br>
<br>
In anguish dividing &amp; dividing<br>
(For pity divides the soul). (13.48-53)</blockquote>
Once again, Blake makes a direct connection between pity and division 
when he maintains that “pity divides the soul.” We can read this 
division as stemming from self-mimesis and from the eighteenth-century 
discourse of sympathy. Pity divides the soul by forcing us to reproduce 
our own past sensations in order to create unity where only division and
 distinction exist. Thus Los’s persistent desire to create illusory 
union prompts him toward self-division and sympathetic bondage (in which
 he becomes tied to another by conceiving of that other in his own 
image). Here too Blake connects acts of sympathy with lamentation and 
mourning, suggesting that sympathy creates only loss, as opposed to real
 unity.
<p>This sense of mourning permeates the allegorical representation of 
pity in the creation of Enitharmon. Not surprisingly, this act of 
generation and creation once again stems from Los’s sympathetic 
impulses. <span class="notecall">As in the original Genesis myth, the first woman, Los’s female counterpart, emerges from his own body.</span><span class="sidenote"><a name="Ostriker" id="Ostriker"></a>Enitharmon
 can be characterized as an “emanation” of Los, a classification that 
becomes important to the role of gender relations in Blake. Note here, 
in particular, Alicia Ostriker’s definition of “emanation” in “Desire 
Gratified and Ungratified,” where sexual division between the male and 
the female becomes a prototype for all forms of self-division (i.e., in 
relation to the self, the self and the other, and the self and God), as 
Ostriker analyzes Blake’s emanations through the paradigm of the Jungian
 anima.</span> Blake thus rereads the creation of Eve from Adam’s rib in
 his parallel pairing of Los and Enitharmon as indicative of the 
philosophical structure of sympathy. <span class="notecall">In Blake’s version of the myth, man in pity forms a mimetic double of himself by dividing his own form:</span><span class="sidenote">Irene
 Tayler, in “The Woman Scaly,” equates the division of the sexes with 
other examples of division in Blake’s poetry. She proclaims that sensual
 enjoyment leads to the movement outward from self-enclosure. Tayler 
also examines female “emanations” in Blake’s work, describing women as 
derivatives of men, but also as divisions from the male counterpart. My 
reading of sympathy in <em>The Book of Urizen</em> largely depends upon 
the interplay between the genders in Blake’s works as divisions rather 
than unifications (particularly in regard to Los and Enitharmon).</span>
</p><blockquote>The globe of life blood trembled,<br>
Branching out into roots;<br>
Fibrous, writhing upon the winds:<br>
Fibres of blood, milk and tears:<br>
In pangs, eternity on eternity.<br>
At length in tears &amp; cries imbodied,<br>
A female form trembling and pale<br>
Waves before his deathy face. (18.1-8)</blockquote>
Again, Blake portrays embodiment as a binding of the senses, which 
actively attempt to free themselves by branching outward. Nevertheless, 
the nerves and fibers become trapped beneath an embodied shell. Not only
 does Blake make a point of emphasizing the importance of nerves and 
fibers as sensual organs in terms of their relationship to sympathy and 
sensibility, <span class="notecall">but he also defines Pity, or Enitharmon, as “in tears &amp; cries imbodied.”</span><span class="sidenote">Enitharmon,
 argues Cox, becomes a satire of contemporaneous notions of sympathetic 
love, especially as it relates to forms of humanitarian pity. Blake’s 
identification of pity with a woman creates a “parody” of the 
eighteenth-century belief that women possess “a greater sensibility than
 men” (54) (hence the association of nerves, or nervous disorders in the
 poem—often attributed to female ailments and tempers—with sympathetic 
sensibility). Moreover, Los here might be characterized as the 
sentimental lover, or the man of feeling.</span> <span class="notecall"> Thus pity becomes an expression not of fellow-feeling but rather of lamentation and loss.</span><span class="sidenote">Nelson
 Hilton analyzes the lamentation imagery in Blake, in particular his 
evocations of dew and tears, and states that Enitharmon’s false tears in
 <em>The Four Zoas</em> indicate a type of weeping indicative of false 
mourning. Hilton attributes the falseness of these tears to Blake’s 
attack on the self-dramatization of sentimentality, or more specifically
 on the eighteenth-century preoccupation with melancholy. Blake sees 
this focus on sentiment and melancholia, Hilton argues, as inhibiting 
“the true light of the imagination” and a truer, more ideal version of 
sympathy (49).</span> Pity embodied appears as a horrific image, a sight
 that produces only further sentiments and an endless cycle of sympathy.
 Once Enitharmon receives her allegorical name from the Eternals, who 
flee from her in terror, Los pities his creation, embracing her. As the 
quintessential sympathetic spectator, Los ironically comes to pity Pity 
itself:
<blockquote>All Eternity shudderd at sight<br>
Of the first female now separate,<br>
Pale as a cloud of snow<br>
Waving before the face of Los.<br>
<br>
Wonder, awe, fear, astonishment,<br>
Petrify the eternal myriads;<br>
At the first female form now separate.<br>
They call’d her Pity, and fled.<br>
<br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br>
<br>
But Los saw the Female &amp; pitied.<br>
He embrac’d her, she wept, she refus’d;<br>
In perverse and cruel delight<br>
She fled from his arms, yet he followd.<br>
<br>
Eternity shudder’d when they saw<br>
Man begetting his likeness<br>
On his own divided image. (18.9-15, 19.1; 19.10-16)</blockquote>
Notably, it is the <em>vision</em> of Enitharmon that both defines her 
as, and gives rise to, pity. Once again, Blake connects sympathy with 
sight. Enitharmon’s allegorical naming mirrors the initial act of naming
 in the poem with the figure of Urizen. The Eternals, who are revealed 
as the namers of Urizen, are likewise the namers of Enitharmon. In the 
case of Urizen before his fall, his original naming reveals his 
essential nature. Likewise, Enitharmon’s essential nature, as she who 
stems from and inspires pity, is reflected by her eternal name.
<p><span class="notecall">Enitharmon’s petrifying image both hinges upon
 the association between sympathy and sight and recalls the image of Sin
 in Milton’s <em>Paradise Lost</em>.</span><span class="sidenote">A number of critics have drawn parallels between Blake’s <em>Urizen</em> and Milton’s <em>Paradise Lost</em>. Susan Matthews, in <em>Blake, Sexuality, and Bourgeois Politeness</em>,
 connects stories of rape in Blake’s work to incest (ch. 3, 56-81), 
considering the relationship among Satan, Sin, and Death in <em>Paradise Lost</em>  (although she does not directly make a connection here to <em>Urizen</em>) (79-80). See also Worrall’s analysis of <em>Urizen</em> (43).</span>
 Los’s attempt to “beget his likeness / On his own divided image” not 
only becomes a sexual allegory for the act of sympathy but also becomes 
associated with incest. The incestuous relationship between Milton’s 
Satan and Sin signifies a narcissistic form of reproduction, for Sin 
spawns from Satan’s own self. In springing from Satan’s head, Sin 
emerges as a mimetic double of Satan derived from what could be read as 
Satan’s mental faculties, his psychological projections or 
reifications.&nbsp; Thus Blake views the sexual relationship between 
Enitharmon and Los as something perverse in its underlying reliance on 
self-mimesis as incest. Moreover, the metaphor of incest for their 
relationship further highlights the perversity of sympathy itself, since
 both Los’s creation of and desire for Enitharmon arise in the poem as 
part of a narrative representation of his own pity.</p>
<p>Out of Los and Enitharmon’s sexual relations comes the birth of Orc. Once again, we see a parallel to <em>Paradise Lost</em>,
 with the implications of further incest when the triangular 
relationship among Los, Enitharmon, and Orc comes to mirror that of 
Satan, Sin, and Death. <span class="notecall">Many critics have argued 
that the chain that binds Los in plate 21 (illus. 3) represents the 
bondage of jealousy, and thus the illustration indicates a secondary 
incestuous relationship between Orc and Enitharmon.</span><span class="sidenote">Cox
 reads pl. 21, a kind of family portrait in which Orc clings to his 
mother, as suggestive of incest (155). Notably, he argues, Orc hangs 
upon his mother’s breasts and genitals; thus he reads Los’s chain as a 
chain of jealousy.</span>

</div>
Moreover, Orc’s birth parallels both the horrific womb imagery of 
Urizen’s embodiment and that of Sin, whose snake-like entrails become 
food for her own progeny. Orc as the child of Pity undergoes a birth 
similar to his mother’s when his image produces a horrific response on 
the part of the Eternals, who then name him the “Human shadow.” Again, 
Los responds by pitying his child and by bathing him in “springs of 
sorrow,” an image of pity as a perverse baptism into a corrupt world 
centered upon sympathetic relations, as Orc grows “fed with milk of 
Enitharmon [Pity]” (20.7).
<p>Moreover, Orc’s eternal name recalls his association with Urizen, the
 original “shadow” in the poem. The persistent image of the shadow in <em>The Book of Urizen</em>
 serves as a symbol of imitation for which the object of sympathy acts 
as a mimesis of the sympathizer’s self. Furthermore, the human shadow 
becomes connected to images of lamentation and wandering in <em>Urizen</em> when it foreshadows Urizen’s pilgrimage of sympathetic wandering that concludes the poem. <span class="notecall">As
 Urizen is incorporated into a world of his own imaginative making, he 
thus becomes bound down to the human world and separate from Eternity in
 falling prey to the sights and seductions of sympathetic bondage.</span><span class="sidenote">Cox
 likens Urizen’s pity to that of Los in that they both highlight a 
certain inefficacy of pity: “pity fails to redeem situations which are 
regarded as pitiable” (157). In part this has to do, as I have stated 
above, with pity’s reliance on narcissism and mimesis.</span> Hence, his
 exile transforms into a sympathetic pilgrimage in which he laments 
creation at the expense of individual and sensual freedom:
</p><blockquote>Cold he wander’d on high, over their cities&nbsp;<br>
In weeping &amp; pain &amp; woe!&nbsp;<br>
And where-ever he wanderd in sorrows&nbsp;<br>
Upon the aged heavens&nbsp;<br>
A cold shadow follow’d behind him&nbsp;<br>
Like a spider’s web, moist, cold, &amp; dim,<br>
Drawing out from his sorrowing&nbsp;soul<br>
The dungeon-like heaven, dividing&nbsp;<br>
Where ever the footsteps of Urizen&nbsp;<br>
Walk’d over the cities in sorrow.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Till a Web dark &amp; cold, throughout all&nbsp;<br>
The tormented element, stretch’d&nbsp;<br>
From the sorrows of Urizen’s soul.&nbsp;<br>
And the Web is a Female in embrio.&nbsp;<br>
None could break the Web, no wings of fire,&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So twisted the cords, &amp; so knotted&nbsp;<br>
The meshes: twisted like to the human brain.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
And all calld it, The Net of Religion. (25.5-22)</blockquote>
<span class="notecall">Here the image of the wanderer, as in the typical romantic prototype, connotes mourning and lamentation.</span><span class="sidenote">Hilton discusses acts of wandering as characteristic of romantic melancholy in his analysis of <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em>. Lamentation, “almost by definition,” he suggests, is a state of purposelessness that leads to wandering (29).</span> We can, of course, read Urizen’s inclination to wander as psychological as well as literal. <span class="notecall">Thus his exile serves as an attempt to repair his self-loss according to a Freudian conception of mourning.</span><span class="sidenote">Hilton
 relates Blakean lamentation to Freud’s “Mourning and Melancholia”: “the
 melancholic mourns narcissistically for him or herself, for the passing
 of some earlier fixation is seen as a death or loss of the precious 
self: the intellectualized version of this self-indulgence hides itself 
as ‘contemplation,’ and thought becomes the precipitation of mourning” 
(50).</span> The “cold shadow” points to a double of Urizen’s self, his 
lost essence. Returning to a Humean model of sympathy and subjectivity, 
we might read the shadow as an outward projection of Urizen’s identity, 
which both doubles and divides him through sympathetic sentiment. 
Urizen’s pity, the cold shadow that divides his soul, becomes an 
infectious web that branches out like sympathetic fibers in an attempt 
to unite affectively to the objects of Urizen’s perception, an attempt 
that of course results only in further division, for the “dungeon-like 
heaven” is divided. Blake, therefore, figures Urizen’s shadow of 
sympathy as an identificatory loss that breeds further acts of mourning 
and lamentation, for it jeopardizes the selfhood of both Urizen (as 
sympathizer) and the objects of his pity. The hopeful icon of sympathy, 
the “heaven” in this new world of materiality, resembles more a 
“dungeon” than an Edenic paradise. Moreover, Blake highlights the 
mimetic properties of sympathy when he depicts this new world as an 
extension of Urizen’s “sorrowing soul.” The web, described as “Female in
 embrio,” not only reiterates the notion of materiality and sympathetic 
bondage as womb-like (a perverse conception of creation that does not 
generate so much as it imprisons), but also points to the woman “Pity,” 
Enitharmon’s eternal name, as the seed of this perverse cycle of 
sympathetic bondage. Blake likens the “twisted … cords” and knots to 
symbols of binding that, like the image of corporeal veins, encircle the
 brain, a new-world icon of rationality and “your reason” that replaces 
the former one of the formless senses. For Blake, this new world’s 
revised conception of reason hinges upon a philosophical and religious 
discourse of sensual and sympathetic bondage. <span class="notecall">Hence, he reveals the true nature of religion by naming Urizen’s cold, shadowy web the “Net of Religion.”</span><span class="sidenote">Worrall
 states that Blake’s “Net of Religion” is a “symbol of feminized 
sensibility” and an “effect of [the] ‘shrinking’ senses” (22). For more 
on the topic of religion in <em>Urizen</em>, see Worrall’s “Themes and Contexts” section (19-27) and his introduction (9, 11, 12).</span>
<p><em>The Book of Urizen</em> closes, both literally and figuratively, 
with another image of circularity and womb-like bondage, as “the salt 
ocean roll[s] englob’d” (28.23). Blake concludes the poem by reiterating
 that in this new world of sympathetic bondage, Urizen’s “net” of pity 
stifles and binds the senses, the most important of which is still 
sight:
</p><blockquote>And their thirty cities divided&nbsp;<br>
In form of a human heart&nbsp;<br>
No more could they rise at will&nbsp;<br>
In the infinite void, but bound down&nbsp;<br>
To earth by their narrowing perceptions,&nbsp;<br>
They lived a period of years&nbsp;<br>
Then left a noisom body&nbsp;<br>
To the jaws of devouring darkness.<br>
<br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br>
<br>
The remaining sons of Urizen<br>
Beheld their brethren shrink together&nbsp;<br>
Beneath the Net of Urizen.&nbsp;<br>
Perswasion was in vain;&nbsp;<br>
For the ears of the inhabitants&nbsp;<br>
Were wither’d &amp; deafen’d &amp; cold.&nbsp;<br>
And their eyes could not discern&nbsp;<br>
Their brethren of other cities. (25.43-47, 28.1-3; 28.11-18)</blockquote>
Here Blake emphasizes the bleak relationship of vision to a world 
dependent upon sympathy. Whenever sight inspires feelings of pity, it 
leads only to sympathetic or sensual bondage and thus to blindness. 
Humanity in its corporeal form becomes “bound down / To earth by [its] 
narrowing perceptions.” Thus the “englob’d” earth resembles the prison 
of the human body, and the “narrow perceptions” recall Blake’s former 
image of eyes as “little orbs / Of sight” that can perceive only “by 
degrees.” Sympathy not only divides, as opposed to uniting, humanity, 
but under the guise of “a human heart,” it blinds the human race.
<p>We attempt to see, unite, and relate to the objects of our pity, 
argues Blake, but are bound to an “idea” so remote from our actual 
selves that sympathy, by valuing thought over “impression” and by 
robbing impression of its immediacy through mimesis, deprives us of 
sensual experience and, most importantly, of visionary perception. The 
mimetic concept of the imagination that stems from a Smithian or Humean 
discourse on sympathy becomes, for Blake, a way of obscuring our sight 
so that our “eyes [cannot] discern / [our own] brethren.” Thus sympathy,
 the creator and perpetuator of the Urizenic landscape, which 
illustrates a world that has fallen into material bondage, divides us 
from our surroundings through a mask of unity and fellow-feeling. 
Moreover, pity perverts our vision, our ability to perceive and thus 
create, for the sympathetic eye is one that mimics without seeing or 
creating anew. Thus the freedom of the self, the senses, and the 
imagination all fall with the fall of Urizen, giving rise to the tragedy
 of a perverse new order that, for Blake, centers around the laws of 
sympathy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “human heart” that blinds and binds humanity becomes an ironic 
symbol of perverse sympathy that also recalls the sensual bondage of the
 circulatory system and brain, as seen in Urizen’s embodiment. Hence, 
Blake’s dark vision of the En<em>light</em>enment emerges from a concept of blindness that links back to <em>Visions</em>. In the world of <em>Urizen</em>, sympathy is an agent of blindness, a corrupt sentiment that narrows our perceptions. <span class="notecall">Thus
 the critique of sympathy in Blake’s anti-Genesis myth emphasizes his 
desire to reawaken our sight, to cleanse “the doors of [our] perception”</span><span class="sidenote"><a name="Marriage" id="Marriage"></a>In <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>,
 Blake describes his method of printing as a way of “illuminating” the 
aesthetic object by revealing its inner essence: “The ancient tradition 
that the world will be consumed in fire at the end of six thousand years
 is true, as I have heard from Hell. … This will come to pass by an 
improvement of sensual enjoyment. But first the notion that man has a 
body distinct from his soul is to be expunged; this I shall do, by 
printing in the infernal method, by corrosives, which in Hell are 
salutary and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying 
the infinite which was hid. If the doors of perception were cleansed 
every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite” (<em>Marriage</em> 
14). Hence, Blake’s method of printing becomes a way of cleansing our 
eyes, or “doors of perception.” In this manner, it elevates creation 
over a mimetic form of reproduction and meanwhile combats blindness 
while giving rise to individual and sensual freedom.</span> through a 
method of illumination, or illuminated printing, reminding us all the 
while of Blake’s cautionary motto that “the Eye sees more than the Heart
 knows.”</p>
