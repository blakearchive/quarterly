    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">1</td>
      <td class="body">Of all the modern and contemporary poets who have
 been influenced by Blake, Mary Oliver might seem an unlikely heir. We 
think automatically of the visionary system of Yeats, the pugnacious 
lyricism of Roethke, the prophetic excess of Ginsberg, or the erudite 
obscurity of Geoffrey Hill. We certainly don’t expect to find Blake’s 
challenging and transcendent poetics echoed in simple verses that 
celebrate the “god of dirt,”&nbsp;<a href="#fn2" name="fr2" id="fr2">[2]</a>
 the messy world of vultures, skunks, and pond scum. On the other hand, 
Oliver’s deliberate invocations of Blake prod us to look again at his 
attitude toward nature and the physical body. Even her most 
“naturalistic” poems, like the one above, are steeped in the language of
 art: the butterflies’ wings are “pages” like those of Blake’s 
illuminated books, their energy the “agitated / motions of the mind.” 
For both poets, the human mind marks the border between the material and
 spiritual worlds, and the poet’s task is to awaken the reader’s 
imagination toward some purpose. That purpose generally is not made 
explicit but rather grows organically out of the visionary experience: 
an experience in which “ordinary” perception is suspended.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">2</td>
      <td class="body">Unlike the notoriously difficult Blake, Oliver’s 
poetry seems accessible to the point of simplicity. Winner of both a 
Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award, she consistently ranks among 
America’s best-selling poets.&nbsp;<a href="#fn3" name="fr3" id="fr3">[3]</a>
 Not all critics share this popular enthusiasm: one has accused her of 
“a peculiar lack of genuine engagement with the natural world,”&nbsp;<a href="#fn4" name="fr4" id="fr4">[4]</a> and others find her poems formulaic and predictable.&nbsp;<a href="#fn5" name="fr5" id="fr5">[5]</a>
 Renée Loth cheerfully (if somewhat condescendingly) writes, “Her ‘Wild 
Geese’ has become so popular it now graces posters in dorm rooms across 
the land. But don’t hold that against her.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn6" name="fr6" id="fr6">[6]</a>
 Indeed, the mixed response to Oliver turns upon a crux of romanticism, 
which often finds itself divided between the populism of Wordsworth’s 
“man speaking to men” and the haughtiness of the misunderstood genius, 
which easily shades into contempt for poetry that succeeds in the 
marketplace.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">3</td>
      <td class="body">Oliver has been characterized as a neo-romantic, 
but, her defenders hasten to add, her poetry is “not a flight into the 
transcendent.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn7" name="fr7" id="fr7">[7]</a> This 
defensive notion of transcendence as flight indicates how far we have 
come in our material pragmatism, but it also reveals some confusion as 
to the meaning of the word. In theological terms, transcendence 
(existing apart from the world) is often contrasted with immanence 
(inhering and abiding in it). The word “transcend,” however, literally 
means “to climb over or beyond,” and we may ask what one is to climb 
upon in order to reach those supernatural heights. It is one thing to 
argue that God exists beyond the created universe, but if poetry is to 
transcend the earth, it must take off from solid ground. Blake 
represents the heavenly city, Jerusalem, as a city built “In Englands 
green &amp; pleasant Land”:&nbsp;<a href="#fn8" name="fr8" id="fr8">[8]</a> this material earth is where the prophet must start, no matter how lofty the goal.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">4</td>
      <td class="body">Just as Blake warns against “Single vision &amp; 
Newtons sleep” (E 722), Oliver presents a world that is more than 
matter. In “What Is It?” a white flower becomes a snowy egret, as the 
poet asks, “how could anyone believe / that anything in this world / is 
only what it appears to be[?]”&nbsp;<a href="#fn9" name="fr9" id="fr9">[9]</a>
 Oliver shares with Blake a commitment to seeing beyond the opaque 
surfaces of things to find “the white fire of a great mystery” (<em>HL</em>
 59) even in a grain of sand, and eternity not in an hour (as in Blake’s
 “Auguries of Innocence”) but, more intensely, “in the moment.” Through 
such Blakean images as sunflowers, moths, snakes, and roses, Oliver’s 
adaptation and reinterpretation of Blake help us to reevaluate both his 
“mysticism” and his view of nature, two crucial subjects that are often 
misunderstood. By communing with nature in a way that neither idealizes 
it nor accepts its absolute otherness, Oliver joins Blake in challenging
 and dismantling many of the binaries that have come to define 
romanticism: mind and nature, self and other, soul and body.&nbsp;<a href="#fn10" name="fr10" id="fr10">[10]</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">5</td>
      <td class="body"><strong>Allusions and Appropriations</strong>
      <p>Before exploring Oliver’s explicit allusions to Blake, it is 
worth noting that many more of her poems show a general affinity with 
him, especially the Blake of <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> and <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>,
 for whom “every thing that lives is holy.” Her “Sand Dabs”—a series of 
aphorisms named for “a small, bony, not very significant but 
well-put-together fish”&nbsp;<a href="#fn11" name="fr11" id="fr11">[11]</a>—recall
 the Proverbs of Hell both in their pithy insight and in their 
celebration of nature’s variety and minutiae: “The fur behind the 
mouse’s ear stuns the finger with its softness” (<em>LL</em> 85). “If you think daylight is just daylight / then it is just daylight” (<em>WW</em> 24).&nbsp;<a href="#fn12" name="fr12" id="fr12">[12]</a>
 Another warns the aspiring poet, “Don’t close the poem as you opened 
it, unless your name is Blake and you have written a poem about a 
Tyger.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn13" name="fr13" id="fr13">[13]</a></p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">6</td>
      <td class="body">While Oliver’s recent poems, such as those in <em>Thirst</em>
 (2006), invoke a more explicitly Christian idiom, she joins Blake in 
rejecting a repressive moralism. One of her best-known poems, “Wild 
Geese,” begins:
      <pre>You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body 
   love what it loves.&nbsp;<a href="#fn14" name="fr14" id="fr14">[14]</a></pre>
Blake repeatedly divorces the Gospel from morality, stating, for 
instance, “The Gospel is Forgiveness of Sins &amp; has No Moral 
Precepts” (E 619). On the other hand, Oliver’s celebration of the “soft 
animal of your body” might seem, at least to the later Blake, to be a 
denial of the spirit: a suggestion that we are <em>only</em> mammals. As
 her poem continues, however, it affirms a larger, more expansive 
incorporation: “the world offers itself to your imagination, / … / … 
announcing your place / in the family of things.” It is through the body
 (as Blake would agree) that paradise is regained: “This will come to 
pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment” (E 39). Through the free 
play of energy, “the only life … from the Body” (E 34), both Blake and 
Oliver conceive the reintegration of the universe, a “family of things” 
that is simultaneously material and spiritual.&nbsp;<a href="#fn15" name="fr15" id="fr15">[15]</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">7</td>
      <td class="body">Even the presentation of Oliver’s books suggests Blake’s tutelary spirit. An early chapbook, <em>The Night Traveler</em>, features one of Blake’s woodcut illustrations to Virgil’s <em>Pastorals</em> on its cover, suggesting a complicated relationship both to nature and to literary history.&nbsp;<a href="#fn16" name="fr16" id="fr16">[16]</a>
 Nature is first mediated through Virgil, then through Blake, and 
finally through Oliver, who calls attention to the bookish ways we 
apprehend the “book” of nature. In “Farm Country,” she challenges the 
reader who may have derived sentimental notions of rural life from 
literature: “Maybe you think life is chicken soup, served / In blue 
willow-pattern bowls.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn17" name="fr17" id="fr17">[17]</a>
 The rest of the poem describes the speaker sharpening knives, putting 
on apron and boots, and entering the henhouse. Other poems in this 
chapbook include “The Lamb,” a first-person tale of lost innocence in a 
dangerous natural world, and “Winter in the Country,” an Experienced 
account of “prey and hawk together, / Still flying, both exhausted, / In
 the blue sack of weather” (<em>NT</em> n. pag.). Her sympathy for the 
predator, both here and in subsequent work, recalls Blake’s celebration 
of the lion and the tiger.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">8</td>
      <td class="body">So far, Oliver would seem to be in tune with 
Blake’s nuanced approach to the natural world, and even to echo his 
understanding of the human role in constructing nature. Other 
references, however, suggest a more limited and even sentimental 
impression of Blake. The poem entitled “‘Just a minute,’ Said a Voice 
…”&nbsp;<a href="#fn18" name="fr18" id="fr18">[18]</a> alludes to Blake’s tale of witnessing a fairy’s funeral, reported in Allan Cunningham’s early biography.&nbsp;<a href="#fn19" name="fr19" id="fr19">[19]</a> In another poem, “The Swan,” Mrs. Blake misses her husband’s company: “he is so often / in paradise” (<em>HL</em> 16-17). <em>West Wind</em>, the volume whose title alludes so strongly to Shelley,&nbsp;<a href="#fn20" name="fr20" id="fr20">[20]</a>
 nonetheless begins with an epigraph from Alexander Gilchrist’s 
biography in which Blake claims to have touched the sky with his 
stick.&nbsp;<a href="#fn21" name="fr21" id="fr21">[21]</a> Each of these
 anecdotes seems to emphasize a Blake quite different from Oliver: a 
visionary (or simply airy) eccentric far more attuned to worlds beyond 
the world of dirt, blood, and bones that fills Oliver’s poetry. The 
apparent incongruity demands closer scrutiny.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">9</td>
      <td class="body">Several decades ago, Northrop Frye cautioned 
against referring to Blake as a “mystic,” reserving the term “mysticism”
 for “a form of spiritual communion with God which is by its nature 
incommunicable to anyone else.” For the artist this experience could 
only be “a means to another end,” i.e., the poem. Frye suggests 
replacing “mystic” with “visionary”: “A visionary creates, or dwells in,
 a higher spiritual world in which the objects of perception in this one
 have become transfigured and charged with a new intensity of 
symbolism.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn22" name="fr22" id="fr22">[22]</a> Where I 
quarrel with Frye is in his characterization of the visionary’s world as
 “higher” and “spiritual.” Surely what Blake and Oliver create is our 
own world, only transformed. The objects of perception have not 
disappeared, but rather have become translucent media for divine light.</td>

desire to look through, not merely at, the things of this world. Looking
 through, however, comes only after looking at them with reverence, and 
resisting what Douglas Burton-Christie calls “the impulse to 
domesticate.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn23" name="fr23" id="fr23">[23]</a> In “The Swan,” the allusion to Mrs. Blake leads directly to the speaker’s epiphany that “paradise” is not a distant place:
<pre>              Of course! the path to heaven
doesn’t lie down in flat miles.
     It’s in the imagination

                  touch the shore? (<em>HL</em> 17)</pre>
Imagination, then, is not a means of transport to another world, but 
rather a way of opening the “doors” (as Blake would say) of the senses 
with which we perceive this world: “How do you know but ev’ry Bird that 
cuts the airy way, / Is an immense world of delight, clos’d by your 
senses five?” (E 35). Eternity moves toward the speaker in the shape of a
 swan, and she has only to stand still to receive it. One has only to 
recall the myth of Leda to understand her panic at this approach and her
 urge to turn away from the divine.</td>

turning away. Like “god’s bark-colored thumb” (<em>NS</em> 24) or 
Blake’s eagle, the owl is “a portion of Genius” (E 37) at once revealed

down / … / to drink the black rain water” before rising to “float away

bones” of life and wishes for wings to “rise / from the black rain

 A second reading, however, led me to a much more subtle analogy. “God’s
 blue body” is a hybrid of nature and art, the “fluttering” blue azures 
and the “bobbin” of the weaver’s craft. God was “leaning on the sill,” 
the same “sooty sill” from which Blake turns away. Eternity is manifest 
in this dirty world, “in love with the productions of time” (E 36). In 
other words, Blake’s imagination is fed by the city even if, and as, he 
turns from it. Imagination does not so much rise above the earth but 
from it, as the butterflies from the rainwater.</td>

      <td class="body">Oliver’s repetition of the phrase “turned away” also echoes the final stanza of Blake’s “Introduction” to <em>Songs of Experience</em>:
<pre>Turn away no more:
Why wilt thou turn away
The starry floor
The watry shore
Is giv’n thee till the break of day. (E 18)</pre>      
These lines are addressed to the “lapsed Soul” of Earth, urging her to 
remain connected to eternity despite her temporarily bound condition. 
There is some irony in Oliver’s application of similar language to the 
young Blake, who (she claims) turns away from the earthly city to build 
his heavenly one. Perhaps her apparent misreading is deliberate. The 
turning away that Oliver describes in Blake mirrors her own struggle in 
the poem “Singapore” (<em>HL</em> 8-9), where the speaker experiences “a
 darkness … ripped from my eyes” as she watches a woman cleaning 
ashtrays in the airport toilet.
<pre>A poem should always have birds in it.
Kingfishers, say, with their bold eyes and gaudy wings.
Rivers are pleasant, and of course trees.
A waterfall, or if that’s not possible, a fountain 
   rising and falling.
A person wants to stand in a happy place, in a poem.</pre>
The poem moves back and forth between the speaker’s current surroundings
 (mundane, even disgusting) and her fantasy of the ideal poetic 
landscape, which she gently satirizes. The fulcrum on which her 
consciousness pivots is the wordless encounter with the cleaning woman, 
whose work Oliver compares to “a river,” her dark hair to “the wing of a
 bird.” Although she would like to transport the woman magically from 
the squalid restroom to the riverbank, she acknowledges that “This 
probably won’t happen.” The poem’s resolution resists fantasy even as it
 denies the dichotomy of the natural and man-made worlds:
<pre>Neither do I mean anything miraculous, but only
the light that can shine out of a life. I mean
the way she unfolded and refolded the blue cloth,
the way her smile was only for my sake; I mean
the way this poem is filled with trees, and birds.</pre>
Like the young Blake whom Oliver imagines at the windowsill, the speaker
 feels a visceral “disgust” at the woman’s labor and its environment 
(the placeless place of the airport). The apparent non sequitur about 
what a poem “should” contain seems intended to mock not only Oliver’s 
other poems but also her reader’s post-romantic expectations. Even the 
desire to free the woman from her servitude seems, in part, 
self-serving: another way to sanitize the poem, in keeping with the 
pastoral tradition that conceals human labor. On the other hand, as 
David Baker says, “the poet’s own job is similar to the custodian’s, to 
serve as caretaker to the human <em>and</em> the natural, to try to make
 the world clean again; in essence, for Oliver, not to ignore the world 
in the first place, since beauty and grace are characteristics of people
 as well as snowy owls.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn24" name="fr24" id="fr24">[24]</a>
 More than that, the conclusion of “Singapore” brings nature into the 
airport restroom by means of that look that passes between the two 
women. The poem is “filled with trees, and birds” because the speaker is
 able to see the beauty in the other woman’s work and in her person; 
because she resists her own revulsion long enough to see into another’s 
life. Similarly, in “Spring Azures,” the “sooty sill” of Blake’s London 
is the same window in which God appears to him, and his turning to 
imagination is a turning toward the incarnation of that God.</td>

appears in “Have You Ever Tried to Enter the Long Black Branches,” which
 concludes the volume <em>West Wind</em>. This poem may be read as an answer to Blake’s <em>Book of Thel</em>.
 The “you” of the poem is trapped in the solipsistic selfhood that Blake
 so often condemns, a Urizenic state that, if it acknowledges the world 
outside it at all, sees it as “only an entertainment.” The great failure
 for Oliver, as for Blake, is the failure to pay attention: “Never to 
enter the sea and notice how the water divides with perfect courtesy, to
 let you in! / Never to lie down on the grass, as though you were the 
grass! / … // No wonder we hear, in your mournful voice, the complaint 
that something is missing from your life!” (<em>WW</em> 61).</p></td>

hear the voice of Thel, who struggles to find some purpose in the face 
of her mortality, complaining “who shall find my place” and “no one 
hears my voice” (E 4). Other poems of Oliver’s also suggest conversing 
with objects in nature, as Thel does, in order to understand one’s place
 in the cosmos:
<pre>Last night

slowly, saying,

to come falling
out of the brisk cloud ….&nbsp;<a href="#fn25" name="fr25" id="fr25">[25]</a></pre>
In “Have You Ever Tried …” Oliver speaks not in first but in second 
person, shifting at times into a prophetic, questioning mode:
<pre>Who can open the door who does not reach for the latch?
……………………………………………………………………………
Who will behold the inner chamber who has not observed 
      with admiration, even with rapture, the outer stone?
Well, there is time left—
fields everywhere invite you into them.

      the mystery, which is death as well as life, and

To set one’s foot in the door of death, and be overcome 
      with amazement! (<em>WW</em> 61-62)</pre>                
These exhortations seem to evoke and encourage Thel’s sequence of 
conversations with the Lilly, the Cloud, and the Clod of Clay, in which 
she seeks to learn from them her place in the natural world but shrinks 
from identifying with them: “I am not like thee.” Many of Oliver’s 
exhortations are phrased as infinitives, “to put, to set,” but then 
these “to”s become prepositions, as “god the ten-fingered” (fully 
incarnate) nods “to the flowers … to the song … to the tiplets of the 
honeysuckle.” In other words, the act of placing oneself in a receptive 
position leads to relationships with all these objects.</td>

horrors of the natural body. Specifically, the questions protest the 
vulnerability of the senses: “Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own 
destruction? / Or the glistning Eye to the poison of a smile! /… / Why a
 Tongue impress’d with honey from every wind?” (E 6). When Oliver’s poem
 shifts from second person to first, the speaker sits “among the 
thorns,” speaking “to the wild roses: / deny me not, / but suffer my 
devotion.” Like Thel, she hears a voice from the plants, though not the 
elaborate rhetoric of the Lilly or Cloud. The roses (apparently) speak 
to her in italics, countering “<em>those dark shouters,</em> / <em>caution and prudence</em>”&nbsp;<a href="#fn26" name="fr26" id="fr26">[26]</a> with the command “<em>Fall in!

 ramble my way home.” Yet she does so without Thel’s shriek, and with a 
distinct implication that to be “home” is to be at home in the natural 
world. More particularly, as Vicki Graham points out, Oliver uses the 
physical senses to imagine herself “into the body of another”: a 
blurring of ego boundaries that “many theorists claim put[s] the woman 
writer at risk.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn27" name="fr27" id="fr27">[27]</a>

romantic inheritance, pointing out her resistance to the “male” romantic
 tradition of “achieving an identity that transcends nature.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn30" name="fr30" id="fr30">[30]</a>
 With her “unpatrolled ego boundaries,” Oliver “avoid[s] the anxious 
either/or questions which run through much male nature poetry.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn31" name="fr31" id="fr31">[31]</a>
 McNew’s analysis, however, challenges some feminist critics, who are 
wary of the female poet’s identification with nature.&nbsp;<a href="#fn32" name="fr32" id="fr32">[32]</a>
 To them, Oliver may sound too much, not like Thel, but like the Cloud 
or the Lilly or the Clod of Clay: too willing to lose herself in the 
natural cycle. Indeed, her poem “October” celebrates the speaker’s 
disappearance into, or out of, the natural world. After a fox passes by,
 apparently without seeing her, she thinks: “so this is the world. / I’m
 not in it. / It is beautiful” (<em>NS</em> 62). We note immediately the contrast with Blake’s proverb “Where man is not nature is barren” (E 38).&nbsp;<a href="#fn33" name="fr33" id="fr33">[33]</a>
 Yet Oliver does not say that the world is beautiful because she is not 
in it. Rather, as Burton-Christie notes, “nature does not need us to be 
what it is.” He further points out the irony in which the speaker 
maintains her subjectivity in order to make that aesthetic 
judgment.&nbsp;<a href="#fn34" name="fr34" id="fr34">[34]</a> Graham has
 a slightly different view of the same paradox: “Giving up human 
subjectivity would mean … giving up the ability to mime herself into the
 body of another. … Oliver’s poems suggest that we need language and 
self-consciousness in order to experience stepping outside of language 
and the self.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn35" name="fr35" id="fr35">[35]</a></td>

      <td class="body">According to feminist critics, romanticism’s 
tension between the imagination of the self (usually male) and the 
“otherness” of nature (usually female) creates a special problem for 
women writers. As Margaret Homans puts it bluntly, “Mother Nature is not
 a helpful model for women aspiring to be poets.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn36" name="fr36" id="fr36">[36]</a>
 Elsewhere she writes, “the feminine figure who becomes an object by 
merging with nature, dying as a result, represents the masculine 
appropriation of femininity.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn37" name="fr37" id="fr37">[37]</a>
 McNew points out that according to this principle, the woman poet can 
claim voice and identity only through following the masculine model of 
transcendence. She also argues, however, that Oliver negotiates a third 
way, neither an alienated transcendence of the earth nor a passive 
surrender to it: “Oliver’s visionary goal … involves constructing a 
subjectivity that does not depend on separation from a world of objects.
 Instead, she respectfully confers subjecthood on nature, thereby 
modeling a kind of identity that does not depend on opposition for 
definition.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn38" name="fr38" id="fr38">[38]</a> This strategy seems consonant with Blake’s view of a humanized universe.</td>

      <td class="body">The subjectivity that McNew finds in Oliver appears likewise in Blake’s <em>Milton</em>:
<pre>Seest thou the little winged fly, smaller than a grain of sand?
It has a heart like thee; a brain open to heaven &amp; hell,
Withinside wondrous &amp; expansive; its gates are not clos’d,
I hope thine are not: hence it clothes itself in rich array;
Hence thou art cloth’d with human beauty O thou mortal man.
Seek not thy heavenly father then beyond the skies …. (20.27-32, E 114)</pre>
Oliver’s “How Would You Live Then?” recalls <em>Milton</em> in its 
celebration of a humanized nature, a landscape animated by the human 
imagination. She asks, “What if a hundred rose-breasted grosbeaks / flew
 in circles around your head? What if / the mockingbird came into the 
house with you and / became your advisor?”&nbsp;<a href="#fn39" name="fr39" id="fr39">[39]</a>
 The anaphoric “what if” questions are repeated often enough to shift 
their effect from contrary-to-fact to “what if this is the case?” What 
if the stars are shouting their names? By the end of the poem, the 
object of “what if” is not the external event but “your” perception of 
it: “What if you suddenly saw …? What if you finally saw …?” Though 
Oliver seems much more invested than Blake in the tangible reality of 
nature, she shares his understanding that perception is what makes it 
real for us. And in the final lines, as she affirms the “silver of 
water” and the yellow of sunflowers over money and gold, she concisely 
discriminates between the two possibilities for nature in Blake: the 
negating materialism that closes the senses, and the visionary openness 
in which a grain of sand contains a world.</td>

<p>What, then, of Blake’s notorious hostility to nature? When, in <em>Jerusalem</em>,
 Luvah separates from Vala and “the vast form of Nature like a serpent 
rolld between” (E 193), what we call “nature” is created by the division
 of the “male” subject from the “female” object. When created things 
harden into opacity, into “single vision” (E 202), Blake calls that 
“nature.” Kevin Hutchings has persuasively argued that Blake’s suspicion
 of nature is directed not toward its material reality but rather toward
 the ways in which human beings have constructed, named, and exploited 
it.&nbsp;<a href="#fn40" name="fr40" id="fr40">[40]</a> Blake never denigrates the minute particulars of the clod, the pebble, or the fly, only “nature” as an abstraction.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">23</td>
      <td class="body">Oliver, though often classified (even dismissed) 
as a “nature poet,” similarly avoids referring to nature in that 
abstract way. Her poems are filled with minute particulars: in “The 
Summer Day,” she replaces the generic phrase “the grasshopper” with “<em>This</em> grasshopper” (<em>HL</em>
 60, italics mine). At the same time, her encounters with vultures, 
skunks, roses, and turtles take her to the edge of anthropomorphism 
while recognizing the limits of complete identification in a fallen 
universe. In “Entering the Kingdom,” the speaker wants to dissolve into 
the bare attention of the Buddha, “To learn something by being nothing /
 A little while but the rich / Lens of attention.” She is blocked, 
however, by her persistent human otherness:
<pre>But the crows puff their feathers and cry
Between me and the sun,
And I should go now.
They know me for what I am.
No dreamer,
No eater of leaves.&nbsp;<a href="#fn41" name="fr41" id="fr41">[41]</a></pre>
Her dilemma places her exactly where Blake finds humanity, avoiding both
 extremes of solipsism and dissolution of self. As Hutchings says, “it 
is in the attainment of a balanced relationship between self and 
not-self that one may develop a healthy sympathy for the things of the 
earth without violating the integrity or minute particularity of one’s 
own determinate form or identity.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn42" name="fr42" id="fr42">[42]</a>
 In other words, the speaker of “Entering the Kingdom” does not fail in 
her quest, but the tables are turned on her. She goes into the forest to
 “learn something,” to know, but instead she is known. Without the 
other, there could be no knowing. “Where man is not nature is barren” 
because there is none to know it. Oliver turns the tables on Blake here 
as well: without nature, there is none to know the speaker, no reference
 point to define herself. As Ryan Cull points out, she avoids the 
dangers not only of romanticism but also of postmodern irony and 
solipsism: “Navigating between such extremes, her high achievement is to
 approach nature through poetic discourse, but in a way that almost 
allows nature to talk back.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn43" name="fr43" id="fr43">[43]</a>
 Almost, because she is aware, as we are, that what the crows “know” is a
 projection of her own mind, just as the speaker in Blake’s “Infant Joy”
 projects a voice for the voiceless infant (E 16). The other remains 
ultimately unknowable: that is “the white fire of a great mystery” (<em>HL</em> 59). Like Blake, Oliver rejects the easy (and sometimes dangerous) absorption of or by the other.</td>

      <td class="body">Ultimately, Oliver’s appropriations of Blake help
 us to understand both poets more effectively, seeing past the “apparent
 surfaces” (E 39) of their interactions with nature. The juxtaposition 
of Blake’s more “mystical” moments with Oliver’s earthy realism has the 
dual function of grounding Blake’s visions and transfiguring Oliver’s 
mundane encounters. We might view Oliver as “translating” Blake (at 
least a portion of Blake) for the modern reader. She seizes Blake’s 
ringing assertion that “every thing that lives is holy” and takes it off
 the illuminated page and into the luminous world of the everyday: the 
woods, fields, and shores of her Cape Cod home. In other words, she 
offers one example of how a person might “live” Blake’s vision in this 
world. As a poet who happens to be a woman, she also inherits a legacy 
from Blake that differs from the prophetic and apocalyptic emphasis of 
Ginsberg. Oliver’s imagination is no less prophetic, no less radical, 
but it is radical in the sense of “root”: rooted in the life she sees 
around her and her effort to see what she calls “the untrimmable light 
// of the world” (<em>WIWE</em> 59) with visionary eyes. Her dialogue 
with Blake helps us not only to reevaluate the politics of nature and 
gender in Blake’s work, but also to see that work as a living thing, 
subject to revision by both readers and writers in the eternal 
conversation he calls Jerusalem.</td>

scholar, the stakes are far higher in the conversation about (and

of ecological crisis, an ideal of transcendence of nature … is no less 
problematic than the ideal of ‘harmony with nature.’”&nbsp;<a href="#fn44" name="fr44" id="fr44">[44]</a>
 In other words, both the spiritual estrangement from nature and the 
false ideal of absorption into it become obstacles to surmounting 
ecological challenges. Bowerbank cites the writings of Martin W. Lewis 
and others in promoting a “Promethean environmentalism,”&nbsp;<a href="#fn45" name="fr45" id="fr45">[45]</a>
 humanity’s active management of the planet, in order to slow or reverse
 the damages already done. Without such management, in Blake’s terms, 
nature will be barren. Hence, the conversation between Blake and Oliver 
has ramifications far beyond the scholar’s study or the poet’s morning 
walk.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">26</td>
      <td class="body">Oliver gracefully declines the suggestion that 
she is an environmentalist: “My work doesn’t document any of the sane 
and learned arguments for saving, healing, and protecting the earth for 
our existence. What I write begins and ends with the act of noticing and
 cherishing, and it neither begins nor ends with the human world.” In 
the same passage, she resists the common distinctions between human and 
inhuman, animate and inanimate. If she speaks of “rescu[ing] the world,”
 it is because, like Blake, she sees nature not as an object of rescue, a
 damsel in distress, but as part of ourselves: “The man who does not 
know nature, who does not walk under the leaves as under his own roof, 
is partial and wounded.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn46" name="fr46" id="fr46">[46]</a>
 Blake would have to agree: “‘All things Begin &amp; End in Albions 
Ancient Druid Rocky Shore.’ / … / ‘But now the Starry Heavens are fled 
from the mighty limbs of Albion’” (E 171). For both Blake and Oliver, in
 their different modes, the poet’s task is to make the reader aware both
 of our fallen estrangement from nature and of our integral connection 
to it. Both present a world in which the choice between humanity and 
nature can only be a false one.</td>

<p><a href="#fr10" name="fn10" id="fn10">10</a>. Janet McNew notes 
further that “all of these dichotomies have also been philosophically 
and mythically related to that most pervasive pair, masculine and 
feminine” (“Mary Oliver and the Tradition of Romantic Nature Poetry,” <em>Contemporary Literature</em> 30.1 [1989]: 60).</p>
<p><a href="#fr11" name="fn11" id="fn11">11</a>. Oliver, <em>Long Life</em> (Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2004) [hereafter <em>LL</em>] 81n.</p>
<p><a href="#fr12" name="fn12" id="fn12">12</a>. Also reminiscent of the end of “Auguries of Innocence” (E 493).</p>

<p><a href="#fr15" name="fn15" id="fn15">15</a>. Matthew J. A. Green refers to this aspect of Blake as “visionary materialism.” See his book <em>Visionary Materialism in the Early Works of William Blake</em> (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005).</p>
<p><a href="#fr16" name="fn16" id="fn16">16</a>. Lisa Steinman cites 
“Oliver’s Virgil [coming] by way of Blake” as a marker of Oliver’s 
disengagement from history, as though there could be an unmediated 
experience of the ancient past. See “Dialogues between History and 
Dream,” <em>Michigan Quarterly Review</em> 26.2 (1987): 436.</p>
<p><a href="#fr17" name="fn17" id="fn17">17</a>. Oliver, <em>The Night Traveler</em> (N.p.: Bits Press, 1978) [hereafter <em>NT</em>] n. pag.</p>
<p><a href="#fr18" name="fn18" id="fn18">18</a>. Oliver, <em>Why I Wake Early</em> (Boston: Beacon Press, 2004) [hereafter <em>WIWE</em>] 45.</p>

<p><a href="#fr20" name="fn20" id="fn20">20</a>. A poet Oliver clearly admires, to the point of naming a dog Percy.</p>

<p><a href="#fr24" name="fn24" id="fn24">24</a>. David Baker, “Recent Poetry [review of Oliver, <em>House of Light</em> (with others)],” <em>Kenyon Review</em> ns 13.1 (winter 1991): 197.</p>
<p><a href="#fr25" name="fn25" id="fn25">25</a>. Oliver, “Last Night the Rain Spoke to Me,” <em>What Do We Know: Poems and Prose Poems</em> (Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2002) 36.</p>

<p><a href="#fr31" name="fn31" id="fn31">31</a>. McNew 67, 66.</p>
<p><a href="#fr32" name="fn32" id="fn32">32</a>. I have not been able to
 find a feminist critic who lays this charge against Oliver directly, 
although McNew, Graham, and Diane Bonds all set out to defend her 
against “skepticism that identification with nature can empower women to
 speak or to write” (Diane S. Bonds, “The Language of Nature in the 
Poetry of Mary Oliver,” <em>Women’s Studies</em> 21 [1992]: 1).</p>
<p><a href="#fr33" name="fn33" id="fn33">33</a>. Mark S. Lussier 
challenges the usual reading of this proverb and further notes how the 
Proverbs of Hell invite readers “to adopt behavioral models <em>from</em> nature,” just as <em>Marriage</em> challenges the prevalent dualisms of mind/body and spirit/matter. See <em>Romantic Dynamics</em> (Basingstoke: Macmillan; New York: St. Martin’s Press, 2000) 58-59.</p>
