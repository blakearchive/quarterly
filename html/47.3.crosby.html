<p class="title">“Ah! Romney!”: Blake’s “Supernaculum” Portrait Engraving of George Romney</p>
<p class="byline">By Mark Crosby</p>
<p class="note"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mark Crosby</span> (<a href="mailto:crosbym@k-state.edu">crosbym@k-state.edu</a>)
 is an assistant professor in the Department of English at Kansas State 
University. He is currently working on a monograph examining Blake’s 
various patronage relationships.</p>
</div>
<div id="text">
<p class="first">How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, <em>however improbable</em>, must be the truth?<br><span style="display: block; text-align: right">(Sherlock Holmes to Dr. Watson in <em>The Sign of Four</em>)</span></p>
<p>With his letter of 18 December 1804, Blake sent two engravings to his Sussex patron, William Hayley. <span class="notecall">These were proof impressions of “the <em>Shipwreck</em>,” after George Romney’s now lost <em>The Shipwreck at the Cape of Good Hope</em>, and “the <em>Portrait</em>,” a portrait engraving of Romney.</span><span class="fn"><em>The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</em>, ed. David V. Erdman, newly rev. ed. (New York: Anchor–Random House, 1988) [hereafter cited as E] 758.</span> Both were commissioned by Hayley to illustrate his <em>Life of George Romney</em> (1809). <span class="notecall">Only Blake’s “Sketch of a Shipwreck after Romney,” however, was included in the published biography.</span><span class="fn">Hayley’s <em>Life of Romney</em>
 includes twelve engravings, seven by Caroline Watson and the other five
 by Blake, Abraham Raimbach, Robert Mitchell Meadows, William Haines, 
and Robert Cooper. For Blake’s involvement with the biography, see 
Morton D. Paley, <a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/viewArticle/paley452/paley452html" target="_blank">“William Blake, George Romney, and <em>The Life of George Romney, Esq.</em>,”</a> <em>Blake</em> 45.2 (fall 2011): 50-65.</span>
 Untraced since the 1939 Blake exhibition in Philadelphia, the rejected 
portrait engraving derives from Romney’s large, unfinished self-portrait
 executed in his forty-ninth year, <span class="notecall">which is now in the National Portrait Gallery, London.</span><span class="fn">The
 evidence that Blake’s engraving is based on this self-portrait by 
Romney is set forth in Mark Crosby and Robert N. Essick, “‘the fiends of
 Commerce’: Blake’s Letter to William Hayley, 7 August 1804,” <em>Blake</em> 44.2 (fall 2010): 61-63.</span>
 The brief catalogue entry for the Philadelphia exhibition describes 
Blake’s “portrait of Romney” as a “line engraving” that was <span class="notecall">“lent by Lessing J. Rosenwald.”</span><span class="fn"><a href="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015014398823;view=1up;seq=87" target="_blank"><em>William
 Blake 1757–1827: A Descriptive Catalogue of an Exhibition of the Works 
of William Blake Selected from Collections in the United States</em></a> (Philadelphia: Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1939) 59, no. 104.</span> Unfortunately, no such print has been located in the Rosenwald Collection, <span class="notecall">which is now divided between the Library of Congress and the National Gallery of Art, Washington.</span><span class="fn">Ruthven
 Todd also refers to this print’s being in the Rosenwald Collection in 
his edition of Alexander Gilchrist’s biography of Blake. See Gilchrist, <em>Life of William Blake</em>,
 ed. Todd (London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons; New York: E. P. Dutton, 1942) 
380. He repeats this information in his revised edition of 1945 (381). 
In a typescript catalogue of Blake’s paintings and drawings, Todd also 
claims that “a copy of this rejected plate” is “in the collection of Mr.
 Lessing J. Rosenwald … shewn at Philadelphia in 1939” (catalogue now in
 the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress). For the suggestion that
 Todd’s statements are based on the entry in the Philadelphia exhibition
 catalogue, see Crosby and Essick 63 and n30.</span></p>
<p>An anonymous engraving of Romney after his unfinished self-portrait <span class="notecall">has come to light.</span><span class="fn">The
 print was purchased in 2011 from Grosvenor Prints, London, by the book 
dealer John Windle acting for Robert N. Essick. In their online 
catalogue, Grosvenor attributed the print to Watson based on her 
frontispiece to Hayley’s <em>Life of Romney</em>, which includes a 
stipple engraving of the portrait. Watson’s version is very different 
from the anonymous print discussed here.</span> This recently discovered print is before all letters, suggesting that it is a proof impression.

<span class="notecall">The print (illus. 1) is on wove paper that has been trimmed inside the platemark.</span><span class="fn">There is no watermark. For full bibliographical information, see Robert N. Essick, <a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/viewArticle/essick454/essick454html#Romney" target="_blank">“Blake in the Marketplace, 2011,”</a> <em>Blake</em> 45.4 (spring 2012): 141.</span>
 The image has been heavily worked using a variety of etching/engraving 
techniques, including line and stipple. Below the image is the pencil 
inscription “George Romney, the Portrait Painter Self-Portrait” in an 
unknown but probably modern hand. The graphic syntax (the linear 
patterns, dots, and flicks used to represent objects, textures, and 
tonality) recalls engravings of the second half of the eighteenth 
century, which suggests that it was executed no later than c. 1820. 
Indeed, the physical, technical, and aesthetic properties of the print 
are consistent with other eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century 
reproductive engravings, including those by Blake.
<p><span class="notecall">Significantly, the model for the 
print—Romney’s unfinished self-portrait—was in Hayley’s possession until
 it passed to Romney’s son, John, around 1820.</span><span class="fn">John
 Romney claims that Hayley “did not allow him [George Romney] to finish 
it, but hurried it off to Eartham without delay” (John Romney, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=i4IOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DFl6UvzmJZbKsQT68oCIBA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank"><em>Memoirs of the Life and Works of George Romney</em></a> [London: Baldwin and Cradock, 1830] 192). For John Romney’s acquisition of the painting, see note 9, below.</span>
 The only visual sources for this painting that were in public 
circulation prior to 1820 were Blake’s portrait miniature of Romney that
 Hayley had given to William Long (now untraced), an engraving by 
William Ridley after Blake’s miniature, published as the frontispiece to
 the April 1803 issue of the <em>European Magazine, and London Review</em>, <span class="notecall">and Watson’s frontispiece to Hayley’s <em>Life of Romney</em>, published in 1809.</span><span class="fn">For
 Blake’s miniature of Romney given to Long and Ridley’s engraving, see 
Blake to Hayley, 16 March 1804 (E 744) and Crosby and Essick 62-63. Alex
 Kidson suggests that the self-portrait was presented to John Romney by 
Hayley “about 1820” (Kidson, <em>George Romney 1734–1802</em> [London: 
National Portrait Gallery Publications, 2002] 180). An undated stipple 
engraving by Thomas Wright after Romney’s unfinished self-portrait is 
the frontispiece for John Romney’s <em>Memoirs</em>. For a list of Romney’s self-portraits and engravings deriving from them, see Humphry Ward and W. Roberts, <em>Romney: A Biographical and Critical Essay with a Catalogue Raisonné of His Works</em>, vol. 2 (London: Agnew &amp; Sons; New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1904) 134.</span>
 A number of crucial differences between the Ridley and Watson 
engravings and the recently discovered print, particularly in the 
delineation of the background, clothing, and character of Romney’s face,
 <span class="notecall">discount them as sources.</span><span class="fn">For
 example, the anonymous print depicts a smile line extending vertically 
from the left side of the mouth, consistent with the original painting. 
The Ridley and Watson prints do not show this line. The lapel of 
Romney’s coat also differs from Ridley’s and Watson’s prints.</span> If 
the print was produced in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth 
century, as suggested by the graphic syntax, then whoever was 
responsible for its execution had access to the original painting. Apart
 from Watson, before 1820 only one engraver had direct access to, and 
more importantly was commissioned to engrave, this painting. That 
engraver was William Blake.</p>
<p>In Blake’s correspondence there are more references to a portrait 
engraving of Romney than to any other reproductive engraving he 
executed. The epistolary evidence indicates that he began the engraving 
during the final months of his stay in Felpham and continued to work on 
the plate until at least late 1804. <span class="notecall">In a letter 
to John Flaxman of 7 August 1803, Hayley reveals that Blake had “made 
two excellent drawings of Romney” after the unfinished self-portrait and
 Thomas Alphonso Hayley’s medallion, and that he intends for both to be 
“engraved for a single quarto volume of [Romney’s] Life.”</span><span class="fn">G. E. Bentley, Jr., <em>Blake Records</em>, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale UP, 2004) [hereafter cited as <em>BR</em>(2)] 157.</span> <span class="notecall">An
 initial fee of thirty guineas was agreed for the engraving after the 
self-portrait before Blake increased his fee to forty guineas.</span><a name="12" id="12"></a><span class="fn">Hayley
 relates his negotiations with Blake to Flaxman: “Blake surprised me a 
little in saying (after we had settled the price of 30 Guineas for the 
first [portrait engraving of Romney] the price which He had for the 
Cowper) that Romneys head would require much Labor &amp; he must have 40
 for it—startled as I was I replied I will not stint you in behalf of 
Romney” (<em>BR</em>[2] 157).</span> Because of this rise and the amount
 Blake had asked for engraving the medallion, Hayley did not finalize 
the medallion commission. Shortly after he returned to London, Blake 
wrote to Hayley, “I lose no moment to complete Romney to satisfaction” 
(7 October 1803, E 736). Over the next few weeks he appears to have made
 significant progress: “I go on finishing Romney with spirit” (26 
October, E 738). In a letter of 13 December, he implies that the plate 
was sufficiently finished for proofs to be taken: “M<sup>r</sup> Romney[s] Portrait goes on with spirit. I do not send a proof because I cannot get one the Printers [<em>being</em>]
 &lt;having been this afternoon&gt; unable or unwilling &amp; my Press 
not yet being put up” (E 739). On 16 March 1804, Blake sent Ridley’s 
engraving of Romney to Hayley, describing it as “a copy from that 
Miniature; you kindly sufferd me to make, from the Picture of Romney 
which I am now Engraving” (E 744). <span class="notecall">By the 
beginning of May, Blake had either assembled his own press or convinced 
the previously unable/unwilling copperplate printer to pull a proof 
impression of the plate, which was shown to one of Romney’s oldest 
friends, Adam Walker:</span><span class="fn">For Romney and Walker, see Paley, “William Blake, George Romney, and <em>The Life of George Romney, Esq.</em>” 54-55.</span>
<span class="extract">I have seen the elder Mr. Walker. He knew and 
admired without any preface my print of Romney, and when his daughter 
came in he gave the print into her hand without a word, and she 
immediately said, “Ah! Romney! younger than I have known him, <em>but very like indeed</em>.” (E 748)</span>
Despite these testimonials, Blake did not send a proof to Hayley for 
another two months. On 22 June he offered an update on his progress, 
citing his former business partner, James Parker, to emphasize the 
quality of the engraving: “Head of Romney is in very great forwardness. 
Parker commends it highly. Flaxman has not yet seen it. but shall soon, 
&amp; then you shall have a Proof of it for your remarks also” (E 753). 
Flaxman may have seen the print shortly afterward, for on 16 July Blake 
sent a proof, “still [in] an unfinishd state” (E 753), to Hayley.</p>
<p>Part of Blake’s dilatoriness may be explained by other projects he 
was then working on for Hayley, such as the two plates for the third 
volume of <em>The Life of Cowper</em> (1803–04), as well as other commercial work, <span class="notecall">including the frontispiece to Prince Hoare’s <em>Academic Correspondence</em> (1804).</span><span class="fn">Blake
 appears to have prioritized the two Cowper plates over the Romney 
portrait engraving, probably beginning work on them at the beginning of 
1804; on 23 February, he informed Hayley that the Cowper plates “are 
both in great forwardness” (E 742). They were published on 25 March. In a
 letter to Hoare of 25 December 1803 (<em>BR</em>[2] 174-75), Flaxman recommended Blake for the <em>Academic Correspondence</em> engraving, which was evidently finished by the beginning of February 1804, for a review of the pamphlet in the <em>Literary Journal</em> opines that “the Royal Academy of England might have offered an engraving worthy of the subject, and of the country” (<em>BR</em>[2] 190). For the Cowper and Hoare plates, see Robert N. Essick, <em>William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations</em> (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1991) 89-91.</span>
 In addition, Blake was acting as Hayley’s representative in London, 
locating, inspecting, and, with Flaxman’s help, compiling a list of 
paintings to be engraved as illustrations for the biography of Romney. 
During this period, he also began relief-etching his two epic poems, <em>Milton</em> and <em>Jerusalem</em>, according to the 1804 dates on their title pages.</p>
<p>Almost a month before Blake sent a proof, <span class="notecall">Hayley had solicited Flaxman’s advice on hiring other engravers to work on the prospective illustrations for the biography.</span><span class="fn">In a letter to Flaxman of 18 June 1804, Hayley seeks advice on employing “your Freand Cromak” (<em>BR</em>[2] 196). Flaxman had earlier advised against employing Watson for book illustrations (see <em>BR</em>[2] 194).</span> By August, Blake was aware that Hayley was considering Watson, whose delicate stippling style appealed to fashionable tastes, <span class="notecall">to engrave Thomas Alphonso’s medallion of Romney.</span><span class="fn">On
 23 February 1804, Blake relates Daniel Braithwaite’s “wish that you 
[Hayley] would give the Public an Engraving of that Medallion by your 
Sons matchless hand” (E 742). He may have been attempting to revive the 
medallion commission, which had been left unresolved in August 1803 
owing to his increase in fees (see <a href="#12">note 12</a>, above).</span> On 7 August, Blake approves of Watson, stating that <span class="notecall">“Miss. W. would Engrave your Sons Medallion of Romney most delicately.”</span><span class="fn">For a full transcription of this letter, see Crosby and Essick 53-54.</span> While Hayley’s decision to commission Watson may have been informed by the criticisms that Blake’s engravings for <em>The Life of Cowper</em> and his six plates for <em>The Triumphs of Temper</em>
 had received from Lady Hesketh and her circle (Hesketh favored the 
softer aesthetic associated with Watson’s style of stippling), <span class="notecall">there were also practical reasons for his employing other engravers on the Romney biography.</span><a name="18" id="18"></a><span class="fn">For a discussion of contemporary criticisms of Blake’s plates for <em>The Triumphs of Temper</em>, see Crosby, “‘a Ladys Book’: Blake’s Engravings for Hayley’s <em>The Triumphs of Temper</em>,” <em>Blake in Our Time: Essays in Honour of G. E. Bentley Jr.</em>, ed. Karen Mulhallen (Toronto: U of Toronto P, 2010) 105-30 (especially 112). See also <a href="#40">note 40</a>, below.</span>
 During 1804 Hayley, Flaxman, and Blake discussed the logistics of 
selecting paintings for reproduction and also the style that would best 
replicate Romney’s aesthetic. For example, on 2 January Flaxman suggests
 to Hayley that Romney’s chalk drawings “are all well worth etching in a
 bold manner which I think Blake is likely to do with great success” (<em>BR</em>[2]
 177). In a letter to Hayley of 4 May, Blake proposes altering his 
linear style for the Romney commissions: “Mr. Flaxman agrees with me 
that somewhat more than outline is necessary to the execution of 
Romney’s designs, because his merit is eminent in the art of massing his
 lights and shades” (E 749). <span class="notecall">He goes on to say that he can etch the designs in a stipple manner similar to his 1797 portrait engraving of Leonard Euler.</span><span class="fn">Blake’s engraving is the frontispiece to vol. 1 of Euler’s <em>Elements of Algebra</em> (1797). See Essick, <em>Commercial Book Illustrations</em> 75.</span>
 Because of Hayley’s initial deadline of November 1804, however, more 
engravers were needed to complete the illustrations. In his letter to 
Hayley of 22 June, Blake cites Parker to suggest that even “Eight 
different Engravers” (E 752) would not be able to execute by November 
the eight designs listed. He revisits this point in his letter of 7 
August: “It is certainly necessary that the best Artists that can be 
engaged should be Employd in the Work of Romneys Life.” <span class="notecall">At the beginning of the next paragraph, he describes working on the plates of the <em>Shipwreck</em> and “Romneys Head” with “Spirit &amp; neatness.”</span><span class="fn">See Crosby and Essick 53.</span></p>
<p>Blake was still working on “the Head of Romney” at the end of 
September, promising to send a second proof to Hayley: “You shall soon 
see a Proof of Him in a very advancd state&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not yet 
proved it but shall soon when I will send you one” (28 September 1804, E
 755). The following month, he claims that he will send proofs of “the <em>Head</em> of R and the <em>Shipwreck</em>,
 which you shall soon see in a much more perfect state” (23 October, E 
756). Later in the same letter, Blake describes a transformative visit 
to the Truchsessian Gallery before connecting this experience to “the 
plates I am now engraving after Romney”:
<span class="extract">Dear Sir, excuse my enthusiasm or rather madness, 
for I am really drunk with intellectual vision whenever I take a pencil 
or graver into my hand, even as I used to be in my youth, and as I have 
not been for twenty dark, but very profitable years. I thank God that I 
courageously pursued my course through darkness. In a short time I shall
 make my assertion good that I am become suddenly as I was at first, by 
producing the <em>Head of Romney</em> and the <em>Shipwreck</em> quite another thing from what you or I ever expected them to be. <span class="notecall">(E 757)</span><span class="fn">For Blake’s experiences at the gallery, see Paley, “The Truchsessian Gallery Revisited,” <em>Studies in Romanticism</em> 16.2 (spring 1977): 165-77.</span></span>
In a letter to Hayley of 4 December, he once more claims that the two 
Romney plates exemplify the recuperated artistic vision of his youth: 
“Hope in a few days to send Proofs of Plates which I must say are far 
beyond Any thing I have ever done. … I have lost my Confusion of Thought
 while at work &amp; am as much myself when I take the Pencil or Graver 
into my hand as I used to be in my Youth” (E 758).</p>
<p>Blake finally sent a second proof of his portrait engraving on 18 
December. It appears either that he harbored some concerns about his 
patron’s reaction or that Hayley replied in an untraced letter shortly 
afterward, for on 28 December Blake offers the following assurances: “I 
am very far from shewing the Portrait of Romney as a finishd Proof. be 
assured that with our Good Flaxmans good help &amp; with your remarks on
 it in addition I hope to make it a Supernaculum” (E 760). <span class="notecall">He uses the mock Latinate superlative “supernaculum” to anticipate the high quality of his finished print.</span><span class="fn">“Supernaculum” derives from the German phrase “auf den Nagel” (on to the nail) to describe liquor drunk to the last drop. The <a href="http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/194414" target="_blank"><em>OED</em></a> cites Blake’s letter to Hayley for the use of supernaculum to mean an excellent example of its kind.</span>
 In a postscript, he reiterates his claim that the engraving required 
more work: “I made a very high finishd Drawing &lt;of Romney&gt; as a 
Companion to my &lt;drawing of the&gt; head of Cowper (you remember) 
with which Flaxman is very much satisfied &amp; says that when my Print 
is like that I need wish it no better. &amp; I am determind to make it 
so at least” (E 760). Hayley apparently responded positively to the 
print, or at least to Blake’s commitment to producing a “supernaculum,” 
because on 19 January 1805 Blake states: “I feel extremely happy that 
you think My Prints will do me Credit” (E 762). <span class="notecall">This is the final reference in the extant correspondence to his engraving Romney’s unfinished self-portrait.</span><span class="fn">In
 the penultimate sentence of the letter, Blake refers to the projected 
engravings of Romney’s paintings: “I feel it is necessary to be very 
circumspect how we advance with Romney his best Works only, ought to be 
engraved for your Work” (E 762). On 11 December 1805, he mentions that 
the plate of the shipwreck requires work: “A very few touches will 
finish the Shipwreck Those few I have added upon a Proof before I parted
 with the Picture. It is a Print that I feel proud of on a New 
inspection” (E 767).</span></p>
<p>The epistolary evidence indicates that Blake worked on this portrait 
engraving between 7 August 1803 and at least 28 December 1804. He sent 
two proof impressions to Hayley: the first on 16 July 1804 and the 
second on 18 December. The second one was sent after he knew that Hayley
 had Watson in mind to work on at least one illustration for the Romney 
biography, and also after his transformative experience at the 
Truchsessian Gallery.</p>
<p>The evidence also suggests that the engraving was intended to be the frontispiece for the biography. <span class="notecall">In
 his letter to Flaxman of 7 August 1803, Hayley compares Blake’s 
portrait engraving of Romney to the frontispiece for the first volume of
 <em>The Life of Cowper</em> when discussing prices.</span><span class="fn">See <a href="#12">note 12</a>,
 above. In addition, Blake’s comparison of his “very high finishd 
Drawing &lt;of Romney&gt;”&nbsp; (E 760) to the drawing of Cowper after 
Romney (the intermediary model for the Cowper frontispiece) in his 
letter of 28 December 1804 suggests that the engraving of Romney was 
intended to be the frontispiece.</span> Furthermore, the intended placement is supported by several inconsistencies in Hayley’s biography of Romney. <span class="notecall">In
 1806 Hayley invited Watson to Felpham to make preparatory drawings of 
the Romney paintings he owned, including three self-portraits.</span><span class="fn">Hayley, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6vm8ao7Qks8C&amp;pg=PP11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank"><em>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Hayley, Esq.</em></a>, ed. John Johnson, vol. 2 (London: Henry Colburn, 1823) 59.</span> She engraved them on a single plate for the <span class="notecall">frontispiece to <em>The Life of Romney</em>.</span><span class="fn">For a discussion of this frontispiece, see Crosby and Essick 60, 63-64, and Paley, “William Blake, George Romney, and <em>The Life of George Romney, Esq.</em>” 60.</span> According to Hayley’s preface, <span class="notecall">“the Introduction and a considerable part of [the biography], were written in the year 1803.”</span><span class="fn">Hayley, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wNRPAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=hayley%20life%20of%20romney%201809&amp;pg=PP9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank"><em>The Life of George Romney, Esq.</em></a> (Chichester: T. Payne, 1809) n. pag. In his <em>Memoirs</em>, Hayley claims that he began the biography “about the middle of December, 1803” (2: 45).</span> He did not, however, <span class="notecall">fully correct his text by the time the work was published to take account of Watson’s tripartite frontispiece.</span><span class="fn">According to his <em>Memoirs</em>, Hayley was “retouching the Life of Romney” and revising proofs during the first half of 1808 (2: 66).</span> The directions to the binder, for example, <span class="notecall">describe the frontispiece as “Portrait of Romney at the age of forty-nine.”</span><span class="fn">Hayley, <em>The Life of George Romney, Esq.</em> [421].</span> He also refers in the main text to a single image: <span class="notecall">“The
 portrait, that forms a frontispiece to this volume, represents him as 
he appeared in the most active season of his existence.”</span><span class="fn">Hayley, <em>The Life of George Romney, Esq.</em> 254.</span>
 In both instances, Hayley appears to be referring to Blake’s engraving,
 which was commissioned during the period that the majority of the 
biography was composed, rather than Watson’s frontispiece. We know that 
he initially negotiated a price of thirty guineas for Blake’s 
engraving—the same amount Blake received for the Cowper 
frontispiece—suggesting a similar size and amount of work for each 
plate. The image size of the Cowper frontispiece is 185 x 144 mm. The 
image size of the recently discovered print is 184 x 145 mm. The almost 
identical dimensions indicate a correspondence in format. Was the 
anonymous engraving designed to be the frontispiece for a quarto-sized 
volume on George Romney? To help answer this question, we must turn our 
attention to its aesthetic qualities.</p>
<p>There are significant challenges in attributing unsigned reproductive
 engravings to specific engravers. For booksellers and printsellers, 
accuracy of replication and uniformity of product were paramount. <span class="notecall">Professional
 copy engravers, such as Blake, possessed a standard armory of graphic 
syntax that facilitated the accurate reproduction of original images on 
copper, which were then printed as uniform objects: book illustrations 
and/or separate prints.</span><span class="fn">For a detailed discussion, see Essick, <em>William Blake Printmaker</em> (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1980) 25-28.</span>
 The emphasis on pictorial fidelity via a standardized graphic 
vocabulary drastically restricts individual artistic expression, making 
it extremely difficult to identify the authors of unsigned reproductive 
engravings based on graphic syntax alone. Indeed, it would be very 
difficult to identify Blake as the engraver of a number of his 
commercial reproductive engravings without a <em>sculpsit</em> inscription. <span class="notecall">For
 example, his portrait engravings of David Hartley (1791), Earl Spencer 
(1813), and Robert Hawker (1820) are highly conventional, executed with 
the standard linear patterns common to all copy engravers of the period.</span><span class="fn">Another
 example is Blake’s “Beggar’s Opera” plate (1790), which Essick 
describes as “untouched by Blake’s own personal imagery or graphic 
techniques” (<em>Printmaker</em> 59).</span> Without Blake’s signature on these prints, attribution would rely on circumstantial evidence, <span class="notecall">as is the case for his apprenticeship engravings.</span><span class="fn">According
 to Benjamin Heath Malkin, Blake engraved “from those drawings” he made 
in Westminster Abbey during his apprenticeship (<em>BR</em>[2] 563). 
These engravings, all signed by Blake’s master, James Basire, as was the
 conventional practice, include portraits of numerous English kings and 
queens. See also Essick, <em>Commercial Book Illustrations</em> 115-20.</span> With this caveat in mind, there are visual clues in the recently discovered print that can help in identifying its author.</p>
<p>Unlike the Ridley and Watson engravings, which are pure stipple, the 
anonymous engraving evinces an unusual combination of the standard 
graphic syntax associated with reproductive engraving. <span class="notecall">The
 background is rendered with dense lines interspersed with heavy 
stippling, probably made with a mattoir, or mace-headed tool.</span><span class="fn">For Blake’s use of a mattoir in his commercial engravings, see Essick, <em>Printmaker</em> 56.</span>
 Similarly, Romney’s coat is delineated with a bold mix of roulette (a 
fine-toothed wheel used to make dotted patterns) and mattoir work and 
combinations of heavy lines to achieve a rough texture. Certain areas of
 the coat, such as above the right arm and both lapels, are exceedingly 
dense. Under magnification, the interstices between the lines merge, 
dissolving the graphic syntax into rugged blocks. A combination of fine 
stipple and line is used to depict the hair, while sparse stippling 
provides form and texture to the necktie. The face is rendered with 
exceptionally delicate stippling, and demonstrates a sophisticated 
treatment of light and shadow on the forehead, nose, and around the 
mouth. <span class="notecall">This deployment of graphic techniques is 
striking, providing a particularly strong contrast between the soft face
 and the rougher clothing and background that is very different from the
 other engravings after Romney’s self-portrait.</span><span class="fn">Blake
 uses a similar combination of delicate stippling to render facial 
features and dense linear strokes for clothing in his extant miniature 
portraits. See Crosby, “A Minute Skirmish: Blake, Hayley and the Art of 
Miniature Painting,” <em>Blake and Conflict</em>, ed. Sarah Haggarty and Jon Mee (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009) 164-84.</span></p>
<p>The techniques discernible in the print were all within Blake’s range of graphic styles. <span class="notecall">For
 example, he uses comparable combinations of line and fine stipple to 
delineate hair in his portrait engraving of Edmund Pitts (c. 1793-96) 
(illus. 2).</span><span class="fn">For the Pitts engraving, see Essick, <em>The Separate Plates of William Blake</em> (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1983) 178-80.</span>
</p><div class="illus"><img src="822.jpg" height="482" width="400">
<div>2. Detail of Blake’s line and stipple engraving of Edmund Pitts 
compared with detail of the anonymous line and stipple engraving of 
Romney.<br>
<span style="display: inline-block; text-indent: 15px">The Pitts print is from an extra-illustrated copy of Daniel Lysons, <em>Historical Account of the Environs of London</em>
 (1796), RB 272584 vol. 10, reproduced by permission of the Huntington 
Library, San Marino, California. The Romney print is from the collection
 of Robert N. Essick.</span></div></div>
 In addition, as with the depiction of Romney’s coat in the anonymous 
print, Blake uses extensive roulette and mattoir work to give a rough 
texture to Pitts’s coat that is juxtaposed to the subtle stippling on 
the face. The width of the roulette lines in the recently discovered 
print, approximately 0.9 mm., corresponds to the Pitts portrait. When we
 examine Blake’s early commercial engravings for roulette work, we find 
the same width of lines in, for example, the roundel borders of “Robin 
Hood &amp; Clorinda” (1783), “Calisto” (1784), and “Zephyrus and Flora” 
(1784). <span class="notecall">These early commercial works also exhibit a notable contrast between bold patterns of lines and dots and delicate stippling.</span><span class="fn">For a discussion of these early commercial engravings, see Essick, <em>Printmaker</em> 55-57.</span>
 In “Morning Amusement” and “Evening Amusement” (both 1782) after 
Watteau, Blake deploys extremely dense linear patterns, with roulette 
and mattoir work in the foreground, while the facial features of the 
main group of figures, though showing less proficiency in the treatment 
of light and shadow than the anonymous portrait engraving, <span class="notecall">are rendered with fine stippling.</span><span class="fn">For
 another example of extremely fine stippling, see “Venus Dissuades 
Adonis from Hunting” (1787). In this print, Blake uses coarse stippling 
on background foliage and delicate stippling on the central figures. See
 also Essick, <em>Separate Plates</em> 145-49.</span> Another such 
contrast is evident in “The Idle Laundress” (1788), where dense linear 
patterns with heavy roulette and mattoir work on the boy’s coat 
represent a rough texture that is juxtaposed to the stipple shading on 
the face.
<p>The technical and stylistic correspondences between the graphic 
syntax in the anonymous engraving and Blake’s early commercial prints 
prompt us to recall his claim in October 1804 that his experiences at 
the Truchsessian Gallery had inspired him to return to his aesthetic of 
twenty years earlier. <span class="notecall">Blake’s rhetoric in his 
letter of 23 October may seem hyperbolic, but for much of 1804 he was 
attempting to secure engraving commissions from Hayley.</span><span class="fn">See Crosby and Essick, especially 68-72.</span> No doubt recalling Hesketh’s criticism of his Cowper frontispiece (she believed that it hinted at her cousin’s insanity) and <em>The Triumphs of Temper</em> plates, <span class="notecall">Blake repeatedly informs Hayley that he is capable of altering his linear style to better represent Romney’s designs.</span><a name="40" id="40"></a><span class="fn">Hesketh requested that Hayley not include an engraving of Romney’s portrait of Cowper in <em>The Life of Cowper</em> (<em>BR</em>[2] 105). In his letter to Flaxman of 7 August 1803, Hayley refers to Blake’s plates for <em>The Triumphs of Temper</em>,
 “I am sorry to say that the Ladies (&amp; it is a Ladys Book) find 
Fault with the Engravings,” before revealing that “the Engravings of 
Cowper have also been heavily censur’d” (<em>BR</em>[2] 157). See <a href="#18">note 18</a>, above, and Paley, “Cowper as Blake’s Spectre,” <em>Eighteenth-Century Studies</em> 1 (1968): 236-52.</span> In the letter of 4 May 1804, for example, he begins by claiming that he is developing a more fashionable aesthetic: <span class="notecall">“I
 thank you sincerely for Falconer, an admirable poet, and the admirable 
prints to it by Fittler. Whether you intended it or not, they have given
 me some excellent hints in engraving; his manner of working is what I 
shall endeavour to adopt in many points” (E 748).</span><span class="fn">Blake may have been referring to James Fittler’s engraving of a shipwreck in Falconer’s poem. See Essick, <em>Printmaker</em> 173.</span>
 By 7 August, he knew that Hayley was considering Watson to engrave 
Thomas Alphonso’s medallion. As we have seen, Hayley initially offered 
this commission to Blake the previous year. <span class="notecall">It is
 possible that, despite approving of Watson in his letter of 7 August, 
Blake may have felt threatened, particularly as her delicate stippling 
style was popular with Hayley’s circle.</span><span class="fn">For a 
discussion of Watson in the context of Blake’s configuration of “Female 
Will,” see Essick, “William Blake’s ‘Female Will’ and Its Biographical 
Context,” <em>Studies in English Literature 1500–1900</em> 31 (1991): 615-30.</span>
 The similarly delicate and skillful stippling evident in the recently 
discovered print certainly evokes Watson, although the clothing and 
background are very different from her work.</p>
<p>There are a number of idiosyncrasies in the characterization of Romney that are suggestive of Blake’s hand. <span class="notecall">Unlike the Ridley and Watson engravings, the print depicts him with a symmetrically bowed mouth.</span><span class="fn">In both Watson’s and Ridley’s engravings, Romney has a slightly asymmetrical bowed mouth.</span> The same visual trope can be seen in many of Blake’s paintings, <span class="notecall">including <em>Adam Naming the Beasts</em>, <em>Eve Naming the Birds</em>, and <em>Christ Blessing</em>.</span><span class="fn">Martin Butlin, <em>The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</em>, 2 vols. (New Haven: Yale UP, 1981) #667-68, 670, all datable to c. 1810.</span>
 In the print, there are lines extending vertically from the left corner
 of the mouth, which, combined with the bowed mouth, hint at a playful 
smile that is absent from Ridley and Watson. Another distinctive feature
 is the enlarged and slightly protruding eyes. <span class="notecall">These
 differ significantly from the Ridley and Watson plates, but are similar
 to the prominent eyes in Blake’s own self-portrait of c. 1802.</span><span class="fn">See Essick, “A (Self?) Portrait of William Blake,” <em>Blake</em> 39.3 (winter 2005–06): 126-39.</span>
 Rather than the introspective, melancholic subject of the original 
painting and the Ridley and Watson engravings, the recently discovered 
engraving presents an artist who, if not “drunk with intellectual 
vision” (E 757), certainly possesses an outward-looking character.</p>
<p>If this print is by Blake, the slightly bulging eyes and bowed mouth may explain why Hayley rejected it. <span class="notecall">The
 expressive character departs not only from Romney’s original, but also 
from the tone of Hayley’s biography, which portrays Romney as 
melancholic.</span><span class="fn">In his <em>Life of Romney</em>, 
Hayley follows the same autobiographical metanarrative that he 
establishes in the biography of Cowper, casting himself as curative for 
Romney’s increasingly frequent bouts of depression.&nbsp;See, for 
example, <em>Life of Romney</em> 255. John Romney addresses this characterization of his father in <em>Memoirs of the Life and Works of George Romney</em>:
 “Mr. Romney was naturally of a placid and easy disposition, and it was 
only in the decline of life, when his health was impaired by 
application, and his feelings ruffled by peculiar circumstances, that he
 manifested that morbidness of feeling, which Mr. Hayley has been so 
particular in noticing” (246).</span> Hayley may have found the engraving excessive in its depiction of the artist as genius, <span class="notecall">a personality seized with excited imagination rather than inward reflection.</span><span class="fn">For Hayley’s decision to choose Watson’s frontispiece over Blake’s, see also Paley, “William Blake, George Romney, and <em>The Life of George Romney, Esq.</em>” 58-59.</span></p>
<p>Without a <em>sculpsit</em> inscription, a definitive attribution of 
the recently discovered print is not possible, but it is certainly not 
improbable that the engraving is by Blake. To summarize the evidence: 
the graphic style used to delineate the print, and particularly the 
rather old-fashioned treatments of the clothing and background, provide a
 <em>terminus ante quem</em> of no later than c. 1820. Prior to 1820, 
the model for the print was available only via the following sources: 
Romney’s original painting, which was in Hayley’s possession, Blake’s 
miniature, which was in Long’s possession, and Ridley’s and Watson’s 
engravings. There are significant compositional and stylistic 
differences between the print and the Ridley and Watson engravings. 
These differences enable us to eliminate them as engravers and their 
respective engravings as models. Therefore, whoever executed the 
portrait engraving must have had access to the original self-portrait.</p>
<p>The correspondence shows that Blake worked on a quarto-sized portrait
 engraving of Romney after his own drawing of the painter’s 
self-portrait for at least sixteen months and sent Hayley two proof 
impressions. The recently discovered print is before all letters, 
indicating that it is a proof impression. <span class="notecall">The image size is within 1 mm. of Blake’s frontispiece for the first volume of Hayley’s quarto edition of <em>The Life of Cowper</em>.</span><span class="fn">Watson engraved the frontispiece for the octavo edition of Hayley’s <em>Life of Cowper</em>
 (1806). Hayley consulted Blake, because in a letter of March 1805 Blake
 states that “the Idea of Seeing an Engraving of Cowper by the hand of 
Caroline Watson is I assure you a pleasing one to me” (E 764). At the 
time, Blake was negotiating with the publisher Richard Phillips about an
 octavo edition of Hayley’s animal ballads, illustrated with new 
engravings. The prospect of producing engravings after his own designs 
rather than a reduced version of a copy engraving that had already 
attracted significant criticism may have influenced Blake’s generous 
reaction to Watson’s gaining the Cowper commission.</span> Until 1806, Blake’s engraving of Romney was intended to be the frontispiece for <em>The Life of Romney</em>, a quarto book.</p>
<p>The graphic syntax of the print is within the range of Blake’s 
techniques, including both the bold linear, roulette, and mattoir work 
on the clothing and the delicate stippling on the facial features. We 
know that during 1804 Blake repeatedly offered to adapt his linear style
 to include stippling and provided an example—his portrait of Euler—for 
how he could execute the Romney plates. By 7 August, he was also aware 
that Hayley was considering Watson—one of the most fashionable stipple 
engravers of the period—for the Romney biography, suggesting that if the
 print is by Blake, it is almost certainly not the proof state sent in 
July 1804, but either the later state sent to Hayley in December or an 
even more finished state executed in 1805. Finally, after his visit to 
the Truchsessian Gallery in October 1804, Blake informed Hayley that he 
had reclaimed the “intellectual vision” of his youth, which he had not 
experienced “for twenty dark, but very profitable years,” and stated: “I
 shall make my assertion good that I am become suddenly as I was at 
first, by producing the <em>Head of Romney</em> … quite another thing 
from what you or I ever expected [it] to be” (E 757). The recently 
discovered print exhibits the same combination of rough linear patterns,
 with roulette and mattoir work, contrasted with fine stippling 
conspicuous in the commercial engravings that Blake produced 
approximately twenty years before his visit to the gallery.</p>
<p>Considered together, both circumstantial and graphic evidence make it
 probable that the recently discovered print is a proof impression 
before all letters of Blake’s portrait engraving of Romney—a plate that 
was, in Blake’s own words, “quite another thing from what” both patron 
and craftsman expected. Unfortunately for Blake, Hayley appears to have 
had different expectations, as well as a different conception of 
“supernaculum.”</p>
