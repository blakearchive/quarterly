          <p>The <hi rend="i">Edinburgh Evening Post</hi> was a weekly 8-page newspaper, with a two-page
section entitled “Scottish Literary Gazette.” The <hi rend="i">Post</hi> is mainly remembered today
because Thomas De Quincey was one of its regular contributors during the late 1820s.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n69" type="note">1</ref> With “more original discussion than any [other] newspaper
in Scotland, the <hi rend="i">Post</hi> apparently “acquired considerable reputation as a journal of
talent.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n70" type="note">2</ref>

          <p>When Dr. John Abercrombie’s book, <hi rend="i">Inquiries Concerning the Intellectual Powers and
the Investigation of Truth</hi>, was published in Edinburgh in 1831, it received a short review in the
Scottish Literary Gazette section of the <hi rend="i">Post.</hi> Abercrombie’s speculations about ghosts and
visions inspired the reviewer to include a brief comparison with William Blake. Although the remarks are not
very enlightening, they at least attest to the spread of Blake’s reputation in Scotland. The reviewer’s
allusion to Blake follows his discussion of the “visual phantasm[s]” suffered by Dr. Abercrombie’s
patients:
<q>
In Allan Cunningham’s lives of the Painters, our author might have found another curious instance of the
same thing, in Blake, the eminent artist, who had such visitors, and the appearance of them was so vivid and
steady, that that writer [<hi rend="i">i.e.</hi>, Cunningham] tells us, that he [<hi rend="i">i.e.</hi>,
Blake] actually painted them; and that so docile were his spiritual <hi rend="i">sitters</hi>, that they
appeared at the wish of his friend [<hi rend="i">i.e.</hi>, Blake].<lb/>
<lb/>
Sometimes, however, (he adds) the “shape which he desired to draw, was long in appearing, and he sat with
his pencil and paper ready, and his eyes idly roaming in vacuity, till all at once the 
<hi rend="i">vision</hi> was upon him, and he began to work like one possessed.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n71" type="note">3</ref>
	<note id="n71"><hi rend="s">3</hi> Anon., “Abercrombie’s Inquiries,” <hi rend="i">Edinburgh Evening
Post, and Scottish Literary Gazette</hi> 7 May 1831 (150-51). The reviewer quotes from Allan Cunningham’s
<hi rend="i">Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</hi>, 6 vols. (London:
Murray, 1829-33) 2: 167.</note></q>
Whoever the author of these remarks may have been, his attitude towards visions was very different from
Blake’s. The review ends with a recommendation that readers “receive . . . the solid instruction, that
those spectral appearances, which terrified our forefathers, are now ascertained to be the results of certain
states of body and health, of those to whom they appear.” No further mentions of Blake appear in surviving
issues of the Edinburgh <hi rend="i">Post.</hi></p>
