          <p>When R. H. Cromek’s edition of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> with Blake’s illustrations was
published in London in August 1808, its printed title page identified the firm of Archibald Constable as the
distributor for the book in Edinburgh. The volume also included a list of subscribers indicating that “12
copies” had been reserved in advance by “Messrs. Constable and Co.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n87" type="note">1</ref> Of the sixteen subscribers in Edinburgh, Constable was the
only one to order multiple copies of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>; of over 500 subscribers throughout Britain,
none reserved more copies than Constable. <note id="n87"><hi rend="s">1</hi> The two title pages and the list

          <p>Robert Cromek enjoyed a profitable association with Constable. As a “wellknown engraver,” he
had “done much work” in illustrating books published by the Constable firm.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n88" type="note">2</ref> Writing to Constable after a visit to the Scottish capital in
1807, Cromek informed him that “The <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> is going on very well. I shall soon write to
[the Edinburgh printer James] Ballantyne [a partner and friend of Constable], about printing it.” “I
got,” Cromek added enthusiastically, “72 Subscribers to <hi rend="i">the Grave</hi> at Manchester in less
than 3 weeks.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n89" type="note">3</ref>

          <p>A review of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> then appeared in Constable’s <hi rend="i">Scots
Magazine</hi> of November 1808. It does not seem to have been cited by any of Blake’s critics or
bibliographers. In the table of contents for the November issue (801), the review is listed under the title,
“<hi rend="i">Blake’s</hi> Illustrations of <hi rend="i">Blair’s</hi> Grave.” After a brief
introduction praising the volume as a whole, the reviewer devotes most of his space to a discussion of
Blake’s contribution. He names eleven of Blake’s twelve designs for the volume, leaving out only the
figure of the trumpeter on the engraved title page. The article is generally approving, and at least does
Blake the favor of taking his designs seriously. However, the critic raises one objection (which probably
derives from his religious beliefs) concerning “the representation of the soul in a bodily form.” This
anonymous review is now reprinted in full for the first time:
<q>
II. The Grave, a Poem; by Robert Blair: Illustrated by Twelve Engravings, from Original Designs, by William
Blake; engraved by Schiavonetti. 4to. 2<hi rend="i">l.</hi> 12s. boards.<lb/>
<lb/>
ALTHO’ this work, strictly speaking, belongs rather to the fine arts, than to literature, yet as it is
employed to illustrate one of the most admired of our Scottish poems, and, from its peculiar nature, has drawn
a considerable share of interest, we think a short notice cannot be judged superfluous. We do not recollect to
have any where seen so much genius united with so much eccentricity. The author shews throughout a turn of
mind altogether his own. A solemn and mystic character, a habit of mind continually dwelling upon the abodes
of death and the invisible world, an intimate familiarity with those ideas, which, to common minds, appear the
most distant and visionary, appear to fit him peculiarly for the singular task he has here undertaken; and
have enabled him to produce a work, altogether <hi rend="i">unique</hi>, and possessing high claims to
admiration. The strength of the expression, and the lively representation of the different attitudes, have
perhaps seldom been equalled. The accuracy of the design, the faithful representation of the different parts
of the human form, according to the various postures in which they are placed, are also, we understand, highly
admired by connoisseurs. The subject is awful, yet attractive; it is one in which all must feel a deep
interest; and though man be a being naturally so bent on pleasure, there is yet a region of mystic gloom,
thro’ which, in other moments he delights to expatiate.<lb/>
There is just one circumstance, which runs through many of these pieces, and which we cannot quite go along
with; this is the representation of the soul in a bodily form. Such an idea we think is greatly too bold; nor
is there any thing in the manner which can atone for the defect in the original conception. We could conceive
that by representing only those parts of the body in which the soul speaks, as it were, and by giving to these
a certain degree of faintness and exility, something might be produced, approaching to our idea of an
incorporeal substance. But nothing can be more remote from such an idea, than the round, entire, and thriving
figures, by which it is here represented. It would even have been tolerable had the soul been introduced by
itself, without its bodily companion, for this the mind might have conceived by a single effort; instead of
which they are invariably introduced together; and the body being generally worn down by disease, the soul
exhibits often a much more bulky and corpulent appearance.<lb/>
<lb/>
The following are those which appear to us peculiarly striking and beautiful: “The meeting of a family in
heaven—the death of the strong wicked man—the descent of man into the vale of death—the soul exploring
the recesses of the grave—the death of the good old man.” The “day of judgment” displays great powers,
but the multitude and variety of figures on so small a space produce a degree of confusion. The “reunion of
the soul and body;” and “the soul hovering over the body reluctantly parting with life,” do not, for a
reason above illustrated, please in proportion to the genius displayed in them. There are also—Christ
descending into the Grave—The Counsellor, King, Warrior, Mother, and Child, in the tomb,—and death’s
door.<lb/>
<lb/>
Upon the whole, we think this is a work which can be contemplated by no artist, or man of taste, without
extreme interest. We are glad to see that the list of subscribers is numerous and respectable, tho’ we
observe with mortification that, of these, Edinburgh has furnished a very small proportion indeed.<supplied

          <p>It was probably Cromek’s name, more than William Blake’s, which spurred most of the interest
in this edition of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> in Edinburgh. As well as his association with Constable, Cromek
was rapidly gaining a reputation
<pb id="p24-252" n="252"/>
for his editions of Scots poetry. In the same year, he published a well-received and important edition of 
<hi rend="i">The Reliques of Robert Burns</hi>, which contained new information about Burns, and new poems by
him.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n91" type="note">5</ref>
<hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> was itself a Scottish poem, and in 1810 Cromek would also publish a collection of
<hi rend="i">Select Scottish Songs</hi> (with commentaries by Burns), as well as a collection of Scottish
verse (mainly written by Allan Cunningham) entitled <hi rend="i">Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway
Song.</hi><supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n92" type="note">6</ref> Yet according to Walter
Scott in 1809, Cromek was “a perfect Brain-sucker living upon the labours of others.”<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n93" type="note">7</ref> On the other hand an Edinburgh writer in the
1850s could remember Cromek as being “much esteemed” in the city for the “enthusiastic attachment to the
Fine Arts,” which he displayed by publishing his “large and splendid edition of Blair’s Grave, with
original designs by Blake.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n94" type="note">8</ref>

          <p>At least one of the contributors to Constable’s <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine</hi> had a “mania
for Blake” which lasted many years. Robert Scott (1777-1841) was an engraver whose illustrations of Scottish
architecture, scenery, and persons regularly appeared as frontispieces to that journal from 1804 to 1817. His
name appears in the Edinburgh section of the list of subscribers to the 1808 <hi rend="i">Grave.</hi>
Apparently Scott frequently tried to impart his high estimate of Blake’s designs to others in Edinburgh. The
editions of “Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> and Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>” containing
Blake’s designs were “the only two books” Robert Scott “seemed to know,” according to a later
recollection by his son: “the most important of all the illustrated books” in Robert Scott’s library
“was perhaps <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, with Blake’s inventions admirably engraved by Sciavonetti.”
Blake’s designs for <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi><q>
had impressed the paternal mind in the profoundest way: the breath of the spirit blown through the judgment
trump on the title-page seemed to have roused him as well as the skeleton there represented. The parting of
soul and body after the latter is laid on the bier; the meeting of a family in heaven—indeed nearly every
one of the prints he looked upon as almost sacred, and we all followed him in this, if in little else. . . .
Would it not be really thus after death?
</q>
Robert Scott’s son could still recall, in later life, the “raptures” he experienced when his father
showed him “Blake’s Designs for ‘The Grave,’” with their “Dread truths” and
“Inspiration.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n95" type="note">9</ref>

          <p>One other Edinburgh writer entertained a high opinion of Blake and his work for <hi rend="i">The
Grave.</hi> Thomas De Quincey frequently paid extended visits to the city from 1814, often in connection with
his work for <hi rend="i">Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</hi>, and his friendship with its editor John
Wilson. From 1827 until his death in 1859, De Quincey lived almost entirely in the Edinburgh area. He probably
knew of Blake from at least 1821 through his “special interest” in Allan Cunningham, and his knowledge of
Cunningham’s links with “Mr. Cromek.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n96"
type="note">10</ref> In 1840, De Quincey was quoting from Blake’s poetic dedication to <hi rend="i">The
