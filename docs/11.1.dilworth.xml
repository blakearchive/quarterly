                    <p>Blake’s longest lyric fable, “The Little Girl
                        Lost” and “The Little Girl Found,” appears to be
                        influenced, in its plot and illustration, by the English ballad called
                        “Babes in the Wood” or “Children in the
                            Wood.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n61" type="note">1</ref>
The sixteenth
                        century ballad Blake would have known from the copy he owned of
                        Percy’s <hi rend="i">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</hi>
                        (1765). The ballad, moreover, was popular in contemporary chapbooks. Not
                        many of these survive from the eighteenth century, and few of those that do
                        are illustrated. But we have some chapbooks from the early nineteenth
                        century which contain the ballad “Babes in the Wood” and
                        illustrate it in a manner indicating that Blake’s illustration of
                        “The Little 
<pb id="p11-36" n="36"/>
Girl Lost” may be
                        based on illustrations of the ballad in the chapbooks of his time. In fact,
                        the picture on Blake’s first page of the song can hardly be
                        called an illustration, since nowhere in the song’s lyrics does a
                        young man embrace Lyca. Rather, Blake’s human figures embracing
                        beneath a tree seem to be a pictorial allusion to the ballad as it would
                        have been illustrated in Blake’s time. <note id="n61">
                            <hi rend="s">1</hi> The ballad is suggested as “source of
                            analogy” for Blake’s lyrics by Irene H. Chayes in
                            “Blake and <corr type="emend">Tradition:</corr> ‘The Little Girl
                            Lost’ and ‘The Little Girl
                            Found,’” <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi> 13
                            (August 1970), p. 25.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The climax of the ballad, which is the episode most conducive to
                        illustration, occurs after a boy and his sister have failed to find their
                        way out of a forest in which they have been abandoned by their wicked uncle.
                        They lie down and die for lack of nourishment. As Thomas Percy records the
                        ballad, 
						<q> Thus wandered these poor innocents<lb/>
 Till deathe did end
                            their grief,<lb/>
 In one anothers arms they dyed,<lb/>

Little Girl Lost” is remarkably similar in
                        composition to the ballad illustrations. Blake’s Lyca and her
                        companion embrace beneath a tree that grows out of the picture’s
                        left-hand side. Above them flies a bird corresponding to the robin in the
                        Banbury chapbook illustration. In fact, Lyca appears to be pointing to the
                        bird directly overhead. <note id="n62">
                            <hi rend="s">2</hi> The reproductions
                            of the chapbook illustrations appear by courtesy of The Osborne
                            Collection of English Children’s Books, Toronto Public
                            Library.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The similarity between the ballad and Blake’s songs extends
                        further. Lyca, lost in a forest, sleeps in a protracted manner that suggests
                        death. Moreover, lions befriend her, and in “Night” lions
                        are shown to be amiable only after death. (The Lyca songs were originally
                        grouped along with “Night” in the <hi rend="i">Songs of
                            Innocence.</hi>) Her transfer to a cave by beasts seems a sort of
                        funeral and recalls the kindness of the ballad’s robin. The
                        children in the ballad die of starvation. In “The Little Girl
                        Found,” Lyca’s searching parents dream she has starved.
                        In the ballad, seven years elapse before their bodies are discovered by
                        humans. This period may have a numerical echo in the seven days that pass
                        before Lyca is found. The seven years of the ballad may also be reflected in
                        the age given to Lyca who, though she is obviously post-pubescent in the
                        illustrations to the songs, is said to be “Seven summers
                        old.”</p>
                    <p>The focus of the relationship between the ballad and Blake’s songs
                        is death’s double meaning. Blake’s illustrations
                        indicate that nubile Lyca’s dying is sexual and takes place in
                        her lover’s arms. If Blake did have the ballad in mind as he
                        wrote his two songs about Lyca, his sexual theme may have been suggested to
                        him by two lines already quoted from Percy that seem especially charged with
                        sexual connotations: “In one another’s arms they dyed, /
                        As wanting due relief.”</p>
