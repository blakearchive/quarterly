<div class="text"> <a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>
<p>The
      2012 marketplace offered some notable Blake sales and discoveries. In my last report I briefly mentioned a
      previously unrecorded impression of pl. 15 from <em>For Children: The Gates of Paradise</em> (<a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/viewArticle/essick454/essick454html#Children" target="_blank"><em>Blake</em> 45.4</a> [spring 2012]: 109, 110). I am now able to provide further information about this
      uncommon print; see the first entry under <a href="#Children">Illuminated Books</a>, below, and <a href="#1">illus.
      1</a> and its caption.</p>
<p>Copy
      Y of <em>Songs of Innocence</em> has had a
      difficult life. <span class="notecall">It was once part
      of a (presumably) complete copy hand colored by Blake, but after a fire in the
      1890s the salvageable plates were divided into copies R (9 pls., now Keynes Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum) and Y (15
      pls.).</span><span class="sidenote">Neither copy includes the title page (<em>BB</em> pl. 3).  The sequence of pen and ink numbers in copy R/Y indicates that 3 other pls. are missing, probably <em>BB</em> pls. 21, 53, and 54.  Fire damage to copy R (and hence to Y) was first reported in Geoffrey Keynes, <em>A Bibliography of William Blake</em> (New York: Grolier Club, 1921) 101 (copy R identified as copy M).  The 1890s date of the fire is recorded in Keynes, <em>Bibliotheca Bibliographici</em> (London: Trianon P, 1964) 55, no. 508.  Evidence for the fire is provided by one “scorched” leaf in copy R (<em>Bibliotheca</em>
 55) and the darkened (probably singed) edges of other leaves in both 
copies.  I do not know the basis for Keynes’s dating of the fire.</span> The latter, acquired in 1962 by Walter
      Neuerburg, was on deposit at
      the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum
      in Cologne from 1978 until the early years of this century. <span class="notecall">The owner, apparently Walter Neuerburg’s heir or heirs, reclaimed the prints in 2004 or
      2005 and sold 8 in 6 lots at Sotheby’s New York on 1 November 2007.</span><span class="sidenote">For information on copy Y, see Detlef W. Dörrbecker, “Innocence Lost and Found: An Untraced Copy Traced,” <em>Blake</em> 15.3 (winter 1981-82): 125-31.  For copy R/Y, see Joseph Viscomi, <em>Blake and the Idea of the Book</em> (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1993) 305-06, 308-09, 311-12, and <em>BBS</em> 119-20.  For a report on the 2007 auction, see <em>Blake</em> 41.4 (spring 2008): 140, 142, 145, 146, and illus. 1-5.</span> In late February 2012, I learned from
      John Windle that the same auction house would offer the remaining 7 plates of
      copy Y in 6 lots at its 26 April sale. Several characteristics, including different ink colors and the
      overwriting of poorly printed letters, indicate that Blake’s creation of <em>Songs of Innocence</em> copy R/Y was a
      reclamation project, similar in that respect to <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> copy E in the Huntington Library. Such copies largely comprise impressions that had originally been put aside
      because of weak printing of their texts. Thus, the dates of printing are not necessarily the same as the dates when
      the pages were selected, collated, numbered in pen and ink, and probably bound
      by Blake’s wife, Catherine. Some
      plates may have been colored, in whole or in part, shortly after printing; many
      plates were colored, or at least had their coloring augmented and many letters
      overwritten, when they were gathered into copies. Blake evidently assembled prints from several press runs in
      four ink colors—light brown, dark reddish brown, blue, gray-black—to create
      copy R/Y in about 1811. He strengthened
      poorly printed letters by hand, added a few gold highlights, and probably
      touched up the coloring of some of the designs. “Laughing Song,” however, stands out from the group because
      of its very different watercolor palette in the design. It was probably printed and hand tinted
      at an earlier date than its companions.</p>
<p>The
      auctioneer’s estimates for the plates of copy Y sold in 2007 were tantalizingly
      low, but the extraordinary prices they fetched—the result of two crazed Blake
      enthusiasts bidding against each other—prompted Sotheby’s to publish much
      higher estimates for the 2012 auction. “The Little Boy Lost,” however, was given an estimate lower than its
      companions because of the questionable authorship of the opaque white pigment
      applied to the text area—see the caption to <a href="#7">illus. 7</a> for details. I did not attend the auction, but
      watched it live on Sotheby’s webcam. Prices were strong, with only one lot selling for a hammer price (the winning
      bid, exclusive of the buyer’s premium) below the estimate range, two lots
      selling within their ranges, and three lots attracting bids above their high
      estimates. John Windle, who
      attended the auction, purchased three lots for two clients. See the entry below under <a href="#Songs">Illuminated
      Books</a> and <a href="#2">illus. 2-8</a> for further information.</p>
<a name="Vershbow" id="Vershbow"></a><p>Arthur Vershbow of Newton Centre, Massachusetts, died on 16
      April 2012. His collection
      included posthumous copy p of <em>Songs of
      Innocence and of Experience</em> and two drawings by Blake, <em>The Waking of Leonora, Design for the Tailpiece of Bürger’s
      “Leonora”</em> (Butlin #338), and <em>Colinet and Thenot, with Shepherds’ Crooks, Leaning against Trees</em> (Butlin # 769.3), one of the preliminary drawings for Blake’s Virgil wood
      engravings. In October I learned
      that the Vershbow collection will
      go to auction at one of the major New York houses in April 2013.</p>

Sendak
    had a close relationship with the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia,
    but as of January 2013 that institution is not in a position to confirm that
    his Blakes will be coming to them.
<p>Grosvenor
      Prints, London, continues to turn up Blake rarities, although sometimes they do
      not know exactly what they have. In May I found on their web site a pre-publication proof of Blake’s
      “Death’s Door” engraved by Schiavonetti—see the entry under <a href="#Blair">Blair, <em>The Grave</em></a>, under Letterpress Books with Engravings by and after Blake, below.</p>
<p>In
      my 2011 sales review I briefly noted the discovery of several pictorial works
      by Blake: a watercolor with a verso drawing, a recto/verso pencil sketch, and a
      pen and ink drawing possibly by Blake, all in an album owned by a descendant of
      Charles Augustus Tulk—see <a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/viewArticle/essick454/essick454html#Tulk" target="_blank"><em>Blake</em> 45.4</a>
      (spring 2012): 109. The executors
      of the estate of James Richard Ley, who had inherited the album many years ago,
      considered giving it to the Tate in
      lieu of taxes. <span class="notecall">Their proposal was rejected by H. M. Revenue and Customs for
      technical reasons, and the executors sold the album in spring 2012 to the
      London dealer Lowell Libson.</span><span class="sidenote">In an 
e-mail to John Windle, 7 June 2012, Libson stated that he had acquired 
the entire album. He has not answered my inquiries about the album.</span> One work by Blake emerged onto the
      market by June and another in October—see <em>Harpers
      and Other Drawings</em> (a nonce title of my own devising) and <em>Parental Affection</em> (Libson’s title) under <a href="#Harpers">Drawings and Paintings</a>, below, and <a href="#9">illus. 9-12</a>, <a href="#14">14</a>. The verso of <em>Harpers</em>,
      bearing sketches for <em>America</em> and <em>Europe</em> (<a href="#10">illus. 10-11</a>), offers
      fascinating information about how Blake developed images for his illuminated
      books. I have not been able to acquire
      a high-resolution image, sufficient for reproduction in this journal, of <em>Bearded Man and a Youth</em>, my provisional
      title for the pen and ink drawing perhaps by Blake.</p>
<p>The
      Fine Art Society of London held a selling exhibition entitled “Samuel Palmer
      [and] His Friends and His Followers,” 30 May to 22 June. The handsome catalogue includes most of
      Palmer’s prints and also works by George Richmond and Welby Sherman. These are all listed under their
      respective artists in the section on <a href="#Circle">Blake’s Circle and Followers</a>, below.</p>
<p>The
      distinguished London art dealer Andrew Wyld died on
      14 November 2011, aged only 62. Christie’s London auctioned most of his
      remaining stock on 10 July 2012. <span class="notecall">Wyld had sold his one Blake drawing to the Metropolitan
      Museum of Art shortly before his death,</span><span class="sidenote">See <em>The Resurrection</em> or <em>The Last Trumpet</em>, <a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/viewArticle/essick454/essick454html#Trumpet" target="_blank"><em>Blake</em> 45.4</a>

      artist’s name.</p>

<p>The
      auction market for important works by Blake concluded in December with the
      “Enoch” lithograph (<a href="#15">illus. 15</a>) formerly in the collection of Edward
      Croft-Murray (1907-80), keeper of the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British
      Museum from 1954 to 1973. This is
      one of four known impressions and one of only two remaining in private hands at
      the time of this auction. The
      verso bears an important inscription by George Cumberland describing the way
      Blake modified the lithographic process. Unfortunately, Cumberland used a very wet ink
      that soaked through to the recto and stained the area above the central figure’s
      head. Given this show-through and
      the other condition issues described in the caption to illus. 15, I thought the
      print was overestimated at £100,000-150,000. My prophetic powers failed once again; “Enoch” fetched a
      hammer price of £170,000 (£205,250 including the buyer’s premium) to a dealer
      on the telephone representing an American institution. I believe that this is the second
      highest price for any single print by Blake, exceeded only by the $3.9 million achieved
      by the large color print of <em>The Good and
      Evil Angels Struggling for Possession of a Child</em> (Butlin #324) sold at
      auction in 2004. I suspect that
      this is also a record price for a lithograph by a British artist.</p>
<p>The
      year of all sales and catalogues in the following lists is 2012 
unless
      indicated otherwise. Most reports
      about auction catalogues are based on the online versions. 
Coverage of regional auctions is
      selective. Dates for dealers’
      online catalogues are the dates accessed, not the dates of 
publication. Works offered online by dealers and
      previously listed in any one of the last three sales reviews are 
not repeated
      here. Most of the auction houses
      add their purchaser’s surcharge to the hammer price in their price
 lists. These net amounts are given here,
      following the official price lists. The value-added tax levied 
against the buyer’s surcharge in Britain is
      not included. Late 2012 sales will
      be covered in the 2013 review. I
      am grateful for help in compiling this review to G. E. Bentley, 
Jr., Nancy Bialler, David Bindman, Calvin D. Brown, Mark Crosby,
      Stephen Eisenman, Louis Girling,
      Jr., Judith Guston, Erin Jue,
      Richard Lloyd, Nicholas Lott, Hope Mayo, Patrick Murphy, Alan 
Parker, Max Reed,
      Ann Vershbow, Joseph Viscomi, and John Windle. My special thanks 
go to Alexander
      Gourlay for his generosity in keeping me abreast of eBay auctions.
 Once again, Sarah Jones’s editorial
      expertise and John Sullivan’s electronic imaging have been 
invaluable.</p>

<div>1. <em>For Children: The Gates of Paradise</em>, pl. 15.&nbsp; 
Inscribed “13” lower left and “Fear &amp; Hope are __ Vision” centered 
below the design.&nbsp; Etching, possibly with a few touches of 
engraving, pictorial image 7.3 x 6.6 cm., platemark 8.1 x 7.2 cm., 2<sup>nd</sup>
 st., datable to 1793.&nbsp; Laid paper without watermark, leaf 8.5 x 
7.4 cm., chain lines running vertically 2.75 cm. apart.&nbsp; 
Provenance: private collection, England; sold in a mixed lot at a 
Rosebery’s auction, London, fall 2011, to the print dealer Nicholas Lott
 of Larkhall Fine Art, Bath; acquired by Essick 30 Dec. 2011.&nbsp; Lott
 has not been able to obtain any further information about the history 
of ownership. <a href="#" id="example1-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('example1');return false;">Click to show more.</a><p></p>
<div id="example1" class="more" style="margin: 0; padding: 0">
<p>In the 1<sup>st</sup> st. of the pl., the background behind the 
hovering figure is hatched with lines rising from right to left.&nbsp; 
This area has been changed into dense crosshatching in this 2<sup>nd</sup> st.&nbsp; The inscription reads “Fear or Hope are __ Vision” in the 1<sup>st</sup> st.; “or” is replaced with an ampersand in the 2<sup>nd</sup> st.&nbsp; The area where the number “13” is printed lower left in the 2<sup>nd</sup> st. shows only fragments of printing, and may have been abraded, in the only known impression of the 1<sup>st</sup> st., present in copy A of <em>For Children</em>.&nbsp; Blake added the number in pen and ink further to the left in copy A.&nbsp; The 2<sup>nd</sup> sts. of all other pls. in <em>For Children</em>
 include a 1793 imprint, but the space between the inscription and the 
lower edge of the copperplate was insufficient to contain the imprint on
 pl. 15.&nbsp; The 2<sup>nd</sup> st. is present in <em>For Children</em>
 copies B, D, E, and probably C (not seen; last recorded in the 
collection of Lucinda Collins, New York).&nbsp; Copies A, B, D, and E of
 <em>For Children</em> are on wove paper.&nbsp; The laid paper of the 
print reproduced here suggests that it may be a one-off impression 
pulled by Blake in 1793 to check his 2<sup>nd</sup> st. revisions, since he is not known to have used such paper to print complete copies of the work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When Blake converted <em>For Children</em> into <em>For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</em>,
 he extensively revised this pl. in 3 stages, c. 1818-26, in accord with
 his new sense of adding contrasting effects of illumination and 
darkness to etchings and engravings executed years earlier.&nbsp; In the
 3<sup>rd</sup> st. of pl. 15, the 1<sup>st</sup> <em>For the Sexes</em>
 st., present in copy B, Blake burnished an aura of light around the 
head and torso of the hovering figure.&nbsp; Other areas have been 
darkened with additional lines, including the beard and body of the 
corpse, the clothing of the woman behind the bed and the child on the 
right, and the back of the man in the foreground lower left.&nbsp; 
Oddly, the right hand and cuff at the wrist of the corpse have vanished,
 replaced by long horizontal lines defining his gown.&nbsp; The facial 
features of the child furthest right have been more clearly defined in 
ways that hint at surprise or wonder; the woman’s features, particularly
 her eyebrows, have been augmented.&nbsp; Bold vertical lines added to 
the background now suggest a curtain rather than an unadorned 
wall.&nbsp; Some of the letters in the caption, particularly the left 
vertical of “H,” may have been cut more deeply. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Illumination around the hovering figure has been extended in the 4<sup>th</sup> st. (copies C and D of <em>For the Sexes</em>)
 and now includes lines of radiance right and left.&nbsp; Burnishing has
 created 2 other highlights, right and left of the foreground man’s 
right leg.&nbsp; Further hatching strokes now darken the background, the
 floor lower right, the legs of the bed, the back and left leg of the 
foreground man, and a patch on the floor above and to the right of his 
right foot.&nbsp; A stippled line now extends down his lower right 
leg.&nbsp; A few short lines have been added to the hovering spirit’s 
hair where it falls along the back of his head.&nbsp; The beard of the 
corpse is more distinctly defined and rudimentary outlines of his right 
hand and the cuff at the wrist, both present in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
 sts., have been returned to the pl.&nbsp; The face of the child 
immediately right of the woman has been turned from right profile to 
forward.&nbsp; His mouth is open in wonder.&nbsp; All 5 faces are 
augmented with short lines and stipple to increase their expressiveness.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>Blake continued to supplement the 4<sup>th</sup> st. revisions in the 5<sup>th</sup> (final) st., found in copies E-I, K, and N of <em>For the Sexes</em>,
 and in a separate impression of pl. 15 in the British Museum, accession
 no. 1894,0612.29.&nbsp; The letters of the caption have been further 
strengthened and printed more darkly.&nbsp; This additional work is most
 evident on the right vertical of “H.”&nbsp; The hovering figure’s aura 
has been reduced in extent, particularly on the right, but intensified 
around his head, under his left upper arm, and left of his right 
elbow.&nbsp; The background upper left, the floor lower right, the back 
and right leg of the foreground man, the side of the bed right of his 
right knee and the right end of the bed, the feet of the corpse, and the
 legs of the hovering spirit have been darkened with hatching and 
crosshatching.&nbsp; Two lines now define the hem or cuff of breeches or
 tights just above the foreground man’s right knee.&nbsp; The faces of 
the woman and children are more detailed; the former now has a wrinkled 
brow and the latter have larger, more open mouths with clearly defined 
lips. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The 5 sts. of pl. 15 accord with the 5 print runs of <em>The Gates of Paradise</em>, 2 of <em>For Children</em> and 3 of <em>For the Sexes</em>.&nbsp; These printings are assigned approximate dates in <em>BB</em>
 187, 197: early spring 1793, late spring 1793, 1818, 1825, and 1827-28,
 the last including some posthumous impressions.&nbsp; Each time Blake 
printed the work, he altered at least some of the pls.&nbsp; <em>BB</em> 197 places copy E of <em>For the Sexes</em>
 in the second (1825) printing of that work, but it should probably be 
included in the third (1827-28) printing with other copies containing 
the 5<sup>th</sup> st. of pl. 15.&nbsp; <em>For the Sexes</em> copy A is untraced.&nbsp; <em>BB</em>
 197 groups it with the 1818 watermark and printing date of copy 
B.&nbsp; If that is indeed accurate, then pl. 15 in copy A is probably 
in the 3<sup>rd</sup> st.<em>&nbsp;</em> Copies J and L of <em>For the Sexes</em> lack pl. 15.&nbsp;Nicholas Lott tells me that copy M of <em>For the Sexes</em>, dispersed in the late 1960s by the London print dealer Christopher Mendez (<em>BBS </em>79), is a group of Muir facsimiles.&nbsp; A complete and detailed cat. of all sts. of all pls. in <em>The Gates of Paradise</em> has yet to be written.</p>
<p>Pl. 15 addresses the difference between material and spiritual 
vision, a theme central to the entire series of emblem-like 
designs.&nbsp; Chauncey Brewster Tinker identifies the hovering figure 
as God and compares the design to the vision of God in the whirlwind in 
the pl. numbered 13 among the <em>Job</em> engravings—see Tinker, <em>Painter and Poet</em>
 (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1938) 113.&nbsp; Most interpreters, however, 
describe this figure as the ghost or spirit of the dead man lying 
stiffly supine on the bed.&nbsp; This majority view is substantiated by 
the insubstantial nature of the bearded apparition.&nbsp; The line 
defining his left shin extends across the right foot of the corpse, yet 
we can see the toes of that foot and the upper portion of the corpse’s 
left foot.&nbsp; These appendages would be obscured if we could not see 
through the spirit’s left leg.&nbsp; Further, we can see the upper edge 
of the board on the right end of the bed that would be invisible if we 
could not see through the spirit’s left ankle.&nbsp; The hovering figure
 is “the Immortal Man that cannot Die” in Blake’s reference to the pl. 
numbered “13” in “The Keys of the Gates,” the explanatory verses he 
added to the series in <em>For the Sexes</em> (E 268-69).&nbsp; Analogues for pl. 15 more apt than the <em>Job</em>
 engraving are “To Tirzah,” in which “Whate’er is Born of Mortal Birth” 
is “Raised a Spiritual Body” (E 30), and “The Death of the Good Old Man”
 among Blake’s illus. to Robert Blair’s <em>The Grave</em>, another design picturing both the mortal and the immortal body.</p>
<p>The man half-kneeling in the foreground reacts to the vision with 
amazement and perhaps fear.&nbsp; The fingers of his right hand separate
 and radiate outward; the toes of his right foot may be curled.&nbsp; 
The woman behind the bed looks up in wonder.&nbsp; The faces of the 2 
children right of the woman express a similar emotion only in later sts.
 of the pl.&nbsp; This would appear to be a family group, but their 
individual identities are uncertain.&nbsp; Archibald G. B. Russell 
refers to the kneeling man as the woman’s “husband” (Russell, <em>The Engravings of William Blake</em> [London: Grant Richards, 1912] 64).&nbsp; Russell, however, fails to see the body on the bed, stating that “a young [<em>sic</em>?]
 woman sits up upon a bed of sickness,” and he may be wrong about the 
kneeling man as well.&nbsp; He looks a good deal younger than the woman,
 particularly in the last 2 sts., and may be the dead man’s “eldest son”
 (David V. Erdman, <em>The Illuminated Blake</em> [Garden City: Anchor 
P—Doubleday, 1974] 275).&nbsp; Geoffrey Keynes describes the group as “a
 man and his wife and two children seated beside the deathbed of a 
father or a friend” (Keynes, commentary in Blake, <em>The Gates of Paradise</em> [London: Trianon P, 1968] 1: 18). &nbsp;</p>
<p>The hovering spirit points upward to heaven with a finger on his left
 hand and down and to the right with his right hand, probably to direct 
the family toward a burial plot for the man’s corpse.&nbsp; Taken 
together, these gestures indicate the different destinies of spiritual 
and material bodies.&nbsp; The right-hand gesture also leads the reader 
of <em>The Gates of Paradise</em> to the next 2 engravings in the 
series, “The Traveller” who “hasteth in the Evening” of life in pl. 16 
toward “Death’s Door” in pl. 17 (E 266-67).</p>
<p>The caption refers to the “Fear” of death and “Hope” for an 
afterlife; the former may be part of the family’s understandable but 
mistaken response to a vision proving that the latter is not in 
vain.&nbsp; “Vision” in Blake’s writings is closely associated with 
imagination: “Vision or Imagination is a Representation of what 
Eternally Exists” (<em>A Vision of the Last Judgment</em>, E 554).&nbsp;
 The caption links together universal human emotions and the creative 
activities of the artist that reveal spiritual realities beyond the 
material veil.&nbsp; Yet the operative verb, “are,” indicates more than 
“leads to” or “causes.”&nbsp; The internal emotions are one with the 
external vision; both are products of mental acts.&nbsp; This is not the
 only passage in Blake’s writings in which process becomes identity: “… 
he became what he beheld / He became what he was doing …” (<em>The Four Zoas</em>, E 338).</p>
<p>The preliminary pencil sketch for the design on p. 61 of Blake’s 
Notebook (Butlin #201.61) appears above a related inscription, “What we 
hope we see” (E 801).&nbsp; This caption, like the engraved version, 
also underscores the unity of inner (“hope”) and outer (“what we … see”)
 realities, but may also play upon another reading of these 5 words: 
this vision of the immortal man is what we hope to see at the death of 
the mortal body.&nbsp; Glue spots indicate that Blake very probably 
affixed thin paper to the drawing and traced it for transfer to a 
copperplate for <em>The Gates of Paradise</em>.&nbsp; He did not, 
however, reverse the design onto the copper, since right and left in 
impressions are the reverse of the drawing.&nbsp; The same basic 
composition also appears in a large wash drawing datable to c. 1780-85 
and inscribed “The spirit of a just man newly departed appearing to his 
mourning family” (Butlin #135).&nbsp; This title would appear to be in 
Blake’s hand and supports the identification of the hovering figure as 
the dead man’s spirit.&nbsp; The woman’s right hand (left in the print) 
is pictured in both drawings; her fingers are spread apart in a gesture 
similar to the foreground man’s in all 3 versions.&nbsp; The dead man’s 
face is clearly pictured only in the wash drawing. <a href="#1" id="example1-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide('example1');">Click to show less.</a></p>

 copy R at 2.6 and 3.5 cm. apart.  I suspect that the small differences 
between these measurements and those recorded here for copy Y are the 
result of different perceptions, different rulers, and perhaps different
 treatment of the paper over the years.  The holes in both copies were 
probably stabbed when copies R and Y were one; they may have been

when Blake printed <em>Songs of Innocence</em> copy S, the <em>Innocence</em> pls. of combined <em>Songs</em> copy S, and <em>Milton</em> copies A-C in that color (see the caption to <a href="#3">illus. 3</a>
 for more on this printing).&nbsp; Several letters, including all those 
in the title, have been overwritten in pen and brown ink.&nbsp; Blake 
used a similar pink wash to color the giant plant in copy F of <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> and a purple-pink hue in copies A and L, all datable to the mid-1790s.&nbsp; The plant is colored gray-blue in <em>Songs of Innocence</em> copy G (1789), pink and gray in <em>Songs of Innocence</em> copy O (c. 1802), highlighted in blue in copy T of the combined <em>Songs</em> (1818), and tinted pink and blue in copy V of <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>
 (1821).&nbsp; The adult angel’s right wing is also blue in copy 
V.&nbsp; Blake colored the plant green in most early copies, but 
emphasized its flame-like characteristics with yellow, orange, and red 
tinting in late copies (for example, W, Y, Z, and AA of the combined <em>Songs</em>,
 all datable to 1825-26).&nbsp; The auction cat. (SNY, 26 April) states 
that the coloring includes “shell gold” (that is, powdered gold 
suspended in water and a gum or glue binder, applied by hand) and 
“gouache.”&nbsp; The presence of the latter medium is indicated by the 
chalky appearance of the colors in the leaf extending below the text and
 the base of the main stem, lower right.<p></p>

when Blake printed <em>Songs of Innocence</em> copy S, the <em>Innocence</em> pls. of combined <em>Songs</em> copy S, and <em>Milton</em>
 copies A-C in that color.&nbsp; Much of the text has been overwritten 
in pen and brown ink, very probably to compensate for weak printing of 
the letters.&nbsp; Blake extended the grassy ground and shadows slightly
 below the lower edge of the pl. and extended the thatched roof of the 
cottage to the right edge of the pl. with washes and 2 horizontal

<p>Blake may have printed “The Lamb” and “The Blossom” (<a href="#2">illus. 2</a>) c. 1811 specifically to augment his stock of <em>Innocence</em>
 impressions and thereby have a supply sufficient to create a complete 
copy—presumably the original condition of copy R/Y.&nbsp; Because he 
already had his press ready for printing and ink available for producing
 the other illuminated books in gray-black ink noted above, it would 
have taken very little additional effort to print these two pls.</p>

 copy O in a similarly heavy and wet ink of that color.&nbsp; The ink in
 all other pls. in copy R/Y was drier, more reticulated, and applied

what we see throughout copy R/Y, but the coloring of the design above 
the text is distinctly different.&nbsp; The colors are deeper, bolder, 
less translucent, and closer to primary tints than the pastel tones on 
other pls.&nbsp; The design was probably colored c. 1795, but the 
transparent washes in the text area could have been added c. 1811 when 
the pl. was numbered and included in copy R/Y.&nbsp; The highlighting in

1811.&nbsp; Blake overwrote all but a few letters in dark and light

been emphasized with black pen and ink lines.&nbsp; Blake gave similar 
attention to the tree’s roots, only suggested in the etched image.&nbsp;
 A thin black pen and ink line below the child’s feet indicates a shadow
 cast by the illumination on the left.&nbsp; The face of the angel right
 of the 2<sup>nd</sup> stanza is in profile facing right in the etched 
image, but has been drawn in three-quarters view in this 
impression.&nbsp; The general coloring of the design above the text, 
including the long but weak beams of light radiating from the 
illuminated “vapour” on the left, is similar to the impressions in copy O
 of <em>Songs of Innocence</em> (c. 1802) and in copy V of <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>
 (1821).&nbsp; There are no beams or rays of light in the etched 
image.&nbsp; The duck, etched on the copperplate above the “y” of “Boy” 
in the title, has almost disappeared in this copy Y impression due to 
light inking.&nbsp; The boy’s hair and the tree trunk show minute 
touches of shell gold.&nbsp; Erin Jue, paper conservator at the 
Huntington Library, suggests that these few grains of gold may have been
 transferred to this impression from residue left on the brush after a 
more generous, and hence visually significant, application of gold on 
other pls. <a href="#" id="example7-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('example7');return false;">Click to show more.</a><p></p>

<p>A condition report, not published in the printed auction cat. of 26 
April but available on Sotheby’s web site, includes the following 
caveat: “There are corrections in the text which are not entirely 
consistent with the hand-retouchings characteristic of Blake’s own 
work.&nbsp; It is difficult to be certain whether this portion of the 
plate was damaged and touched up by a later hand, or whether it was 
indeed by Blake himself.”&nbsp; Sotheby’s cautious statement was 
motivated by the unusual presence of opaque white pigment, possibly lead
 white, surrounding letters in the text.&nbsp; This material is most 
evident around the 1<sup>st</sup> 2 letters of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
 words in line 1 and in an area below “you” in the same line and between
 it and the next word, extending toward the bird flying above the 1<sup>st</sup> letter of “going.”&nbsp; Dabs of white are also visible throughout the 1<sup>st</sup> half of each line in the 2<sup>nd</sup>
 stanza.&nbsp; In 2 areas—the left side of the vertical of the “h” of 
“child” and the right side of the “e” of “wet,” both in the 2<sup>nd</sup> line of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
 stanza—the opaque white intrudes upon the letters, partly covering 
their edges.&nbsp; There are as well 4 droplets of white over part of 
the lower reaches of the 1<sup>st</sup> “g” in “going” in the 1<sup>st</sup> line of the text.&nbsp; Thus, the white pigment must have been applied after the letters were overwritten in pen and ink.</p>
<p>The opaque white was added with considerable skill and attention to detail.&nbsp; For example, the terminal letter of “The,” 1<sup>st</sup> word of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
 stanza, was touched with white to create the space within the upper 
loop.&nbsp; Most of this work becomes clearly discernable only under 
magnification.&nbsp; Blake may have added the white to increase the 
contrast between the letters and their surrounding areas.&nbsp; It is of
 course possible that the opaque pigment was applied by someone else 
after the print left Blake’s hands, perhaps even following the fire that
 reportedly injured <em>Songs of Innocence</em> copy R/Y in the 
1890s.&nbsp; The reason for such intervention, however, is far from 
clear.&nbsp; There is no evidence of staining or any other damage to the
 paper underlying the opaque white when the leaf is viewed through a 
strong backing light.&nbsp; There are several light brown stains on the 
verso, but these do not correlate with the white patches on the 
recto.&nbsp; See also <a href="#4">illus. 4</a> and <a href="#8">8</a> 
and their captions for more applications of opaque white.&nbsp; Both 
“The Little Boy Lost” and “The Little Boy Found” were inspected under a 
Meiji binocular microscope with a magnification range of 7x to 
45x.&nbsp; An enlargement of approximately 15x proved to be the most 
useful for locating and studying the white areas. <a href="#7" id="example7-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide('example7');">Click to show less.</a></p></div>

1811.&nbsp; Although there is far less opaque white pigment than in “The
 Little Boy Lost,” the space between the 1<sup>st</sup> 2 letters of the title and the area within the looping lower element of the 2<sup>nd</sup> letter bear streaks of that color, possibly intended to mask a flaw of some sort (see the caption to <a href="#7">illus. 7</a>).&nbsp; Two droplets also appear above and within the 1<sup>st</sup>
 letter (“H”) in line 5 of the poem, although these could be accidental 
spills.&nbsp; Tinting with light brown wash in the space between the 
design and the edges of the copperplate forms a frame on 3 sides of the 
design.&nbsp; Brown stains slightly mar the lower abdomen of Christ, the
 adult figure in the design above the text.&nbsp; Blake has given an 
unusual amount of attention to the outlining of Christ’s left thumb and 
fingers where they grasp the boy’s right elbow.&nbsp; The adult’s hand 
is apparently under the child’s arm, for the fingers extend upwards with
 the thumb looping around from above and extending downwards.&nbsp; 
Christ’s hand, fingers pointing down, holds the boy’s arm from above in 
copy Y of the combined <em>Songs</em>, datable to 1825; the hand position is uncertain in most copies. &nbsp;<p></p>
<p>The roots of the tree on the right have been emphasized with wash and
 pen and ink outlines.&nbsp; The background landscape is more open and 
more illuminated than in any other impression known to me.&nbsp; 
Although still crepuscular in overall tone, this impression and the one 
in <em>Songs of Innocence </em>copy O (c. 1802) are less distinctly 
night scenes than others.&nbsp; The leafy canopy of a dense forest rises
 behind the boy; 2 tree trunks are visible below his left arm.&nbsp; The
 sky above the boy’s head includes 2 arching bands of light between 
clouds.&nbsp; The figure hovering right of the text lacks a nose in the 
etched image, supplied in this impression with pen and ink 
outlining.&nbsp; This figure’s billowing gown, all 3 large tree trunks, 
and the boy’s hair are tinted with shell gold, either mixed with other 
colors or applied thinly on top of them.</p></div>

Libson, Ltd., London.<br>
</p><p class="desc">A male wearing breeches, a shirt, and a sandal on 
his right foot (left not shown) sits facing forward on a stone (?) step 
or plinth.&nbsp; His thick hair, prominent arched eyebrows, moustache, 
and short beard are darkly inked; his expression is solemn.&nbsp; His 
right hand rests, palm down and fingers spread, on the step.&nbsp; He 
points with his left index finger at a tablet or piece of paper, lower 
right, bearing a few squiggles indicating writing.&nbsp; A round object 
at its left (presumably lower) edge may be a wax seal.&nbsp; A nude, or 
partly nude, youth of uncertain gender, possibly a long-haired male, 
kneels on the floor between the bearded man’s legs.&nbsp; He faces 
right, with eyes partly closed or perhaps looking down at the writing, 
but his shoulders are twisted away from the viewer and his raised hands 
rest upon the bearded man’s shoulders.&nbsp; The combination of motifs, 
particularly the tablet or paper, suggests a specific subject, but I 
have not been able to determine it.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
<p class="desc">The attribution to Blake is far from certain.&nbsp; At 
first glance, the drawing, particularly the head of the bearded man, 
does not shout “Blake.”&nbsp; The same can be said for a somewhat 
similar pen and ink drawing, <em>Charon, Copy from the Antique</em> 
(Butlin #178 recto, dated to c. 1779-80?).&nbsp; Without Tatham’s 
inscription vouching that the work is by Blake, I would be a bit dubious
 about <em>Charon</em>; see also <em>A Male Nude with an Urn, Copy from the Antique</em>
 (Butlin #179A).&nbsp; Several characteristics, however, associate the 
drawing from the Tulk album with Blake’s stylistic habits.&nbsp; If we 
“attend to the Hands &amp; Feet” (<em>A Vision of the Last Judgment</em>,
 E 560) and the musculature of the youth, Blake’s own hand begins to 
emerge.&nbsp; Indeed, attribution would be more certain if one simply 
ignores the bearded head.</p>

<p>The main, central drawing of a man and woman playing harps and 
perhaps singing might be Job and his wife after their restoration to 
prosperity, as in the final pl. of Blake’s Job engravings, but there are
 reasons to question this identification.&nbsp; Even in the earliest Job
 designs, such as <em>Job, His Wife and His Friends: The Complaint of Job</em>
 (Butlin #162, dated to c. 1785), Job has long hair, an exceptionally 
long beard, and is clearly old.&nbsp; The man in this drawing is 
middle-aged, has short and tightly curled hair, and a short beard.&nbsp;
 Playing harps does not necessarily indicate a Job subject; see, for 
example, <em>A Harper and Other Sketches</em> (the verso of Butlin #81, dated to c. 1785; for illus. and discussion, see <em>Blake</em> 39.1 [summer 2005]: 44-47).&nbsp; A <em>Tiriel</em> wash drawing untraced since 1863, <em>Har and Heva Playing Harps</em> (Butlin #198.5, dated to c. 1789), might be related, although the age of Har and Heva in other <em>Tiriel</em> designs matches Job and his wife rather than the couple in this pencil drawing. <a href="#" id="example9-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('example9');return false;">Click to show more.</a></p>

<p>The recto bears several other sketches, apparently unrelated to the central drawing:<br>
• Far left, a youthful male nude with curly hair, facing forward but 
looking down and to the right.&nbsp; He stands in front of a stone 
wall(?) and leans with his right elbow on a shovel.&nbsp; His lower 
right arm extends behind his back.&nbsp; An almost identical figure, 
except for slight differences in the angle of the head, appears on the 
general title page in Blake’s watercolor illus. to Edward Young’s <em>Night Thoughts</em> (Butlin #330.2, dated to c. 1795-97).&nbsp; As in the <em>Night Thoughts</em>
 design, this may be a grave-digger in an elegant pose reminiscent of 
classical sculpture.&nbsp; Blake probably referred back to this pencil 
drawing when executing the watercolor.<br>
• Above the central drawing, a pair of overlapping figures, probably 
female, hovering horizontally or flying to the right.&nbsp; The front 
figure extends her right arm in front of her; small objects or the 
droplets of a liquid descend diagonally from her right hand.&nbsp; The 
similar motif of a sky-borne figure pouring down a liquid appears in <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em>
 pl. 4.&nbsp; In the pencil sketch, the figure in back extends her left 
arm; cloud outlines appear above and to the right.&nbsp; The pair is 
generally similar to (but not a direct preliminary for) the angels at 
the top of Blake’s design for the title page to Night the First among 
his <em>Night Thoughts</em> watercolors (Butlin #330.6), pl. 1 among the engravings (<em>BB</em> #515).&nbsp; Unlike this pencil drawing, the <em>Night Thoughts</em> angels are winged and nothing drops from their hands.<br>
• To the right of the central harpists, a standing female(?) seen in 
right profile, leaning back slightly with her right arm extended upward 
to touch or hold a descending child or putto in left profile, his left 
hand touching the adult’s right shoulder.&nbsp; The figures appear to be
 kissing.&nbsp; This drawing is probably the direct preliminary for the 
same motif in Blake’s relief-etched color print “A Dream of Thiralatha” (<em>SP</em> IX), first executed as a pl. for <em>America</em>,
 1793, but not used in the illuminated book.&nbsp; In this sketch, the 
putto’s legs are together, with the right calf and foot just peeking out
 from behind the left leg.&nbsp; In the print, his right leg is bent at 
the knee and his left leg extended.&nbsp; Right and left in this sketch 
are the reverse of impressions of the color print and thus the figures 
have the same orientation as the design on the copperplate.<br>
• Far right, a standing child seen from behind, reaching upward with 
both arms to touch or hold a descending child, also seen from 
behind.&nbsp; They may be kissing.&nbsp; A few sketchy lines above and 
right of the figures hint at clouds.&nbsp; This may be a rejected 
variant for the “Thiralatha” design.</p>

<div id="example10" class="more" style="margin: 0; padding: 0">
<p>The leaf bears small sketches of 15 figures.&nbsp; Most, possibly all, are preliminary sketches for motifs in <em>America</em> and <em>Europe</em>, as follows:<br>
• Lower right, two figures, likely a male (right) and woman (left—note 
the indications of female breasts) fleeing to the right over the outline
 of a hilly landscape, probably a variant design for the man and woman 
lower left in <em>America</em> pl. 5.&nbsp; In this sketch, the figure 
on the left has her arms bent at the elbows and raised over her head; 
her companion has his arms raised at roughly 135 degrees.&nbsp; In the 
relief etching, the male has his arms down, with his right hand 
apparently holding the hand of a child; the female raises her left arm 
vertically and her right forearm and hand are visible left of her lower 
torso.<br>
• Top and center, a male holding a contracted figure on his shoulders, a
 female (note the carefully delineated vagina) with a sword, a male 
holding scales with the outlines of clouds extending above and below 
him, and an upside-down male within the upper loop of a spiraling 
serpent, all for <em>America</em> pl. 7.&nbsp; In the etching, the 
figure holding a sword may be male, prominent flames have been added to 
the weapon, the cloud is differently configured, and the serpent’s head 
is in a slightly altered position.&nbsp; The placement of the figures in
 relationship to each other is retained, but with right and left 
reversed in impressions.<br>
• Center right, a male facing down and clutching his head, for <em>America</em> pl. 7.&nbsp; The sketched and etched versions are almost identical.<br>
• Upper right quadrant, another sketch of the man clutching his head, for <em>America</em>
 pl. 7, accompanied by two other figures, or variants of the same 
figure, also clutching their heads.&nbsp; These may all be Blake’s 
experiments with various postures in preparation for the relief etching.<br>
• Lower left quadrant, an upside-down, descending male with a large weight attached to him, for <em>Europe</em>
 pl. 4.&nbsp; In the sketch, the man’s legs are bent sharply at the 
knees and his genitals are clearly pictured.&nbsp; In the illuminated 
book, his legs are turned to the left with his right thigh covering his 
lower torso.<br>
• Lower left, a falling female.&nbsp; See <a href="#11">illus. 11</a>.<br>
• Lower margin, a series of three figures above the outline of a rocky 
landscape.&nbsp; From left to right, these are a female with long hair, 
lunging and reaching dramatically to the left; an upside-down male seen 
from behind, arms extended downward with hands resting on a boulder or 
small hill, right leg extended upward and left leg bent at the knee, 
basically similar to <em>The Book of Urizen</em> pl. 14; a female figure
 facing forward with prominent breasts and a large belly, arms 
horizontal and legs bent at the knees and spread apart.&nbsp; This last 
figure may be pregnant; compare to the woman giving birth in <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> pl. 3.&nbsp; None of these figures is present in <em>America</em> or <em>Europe</em>, but they were probably executed in preparation for those books.<br>
</p><p>For each figure used in <em>America</em> and <em>Europe</em>, 
right and left are the reverse of impressions of the illuminated books 
and thus the motifs in this drawing have the same orientation as the 
designs on the copperplates.&nbsp; These drawings reinforce the 
interrelatedness of <em>America</em> and <em>Europe</em>, compositionally and thematically.&nbsp; For a leaf of pencil drawings for <em>America</em> of similar size and date, see <em>Sketches for “America” and Other Books</em> (Butlin #226), illus. and discussed in <a href="45.4.essickamerica" target="_blank"><em>Blake</em> 45.4</a> (spring 2012): 111-12.</p>

<div>11.&nbsp;Preliminary sketches for <em>America</em> and <em>Europe</em> (<a href="#10">illus. 10</a>),
 detail of pencil sketch lower left, approximately 3.7 x 3.2 cm.&nbsp; A
 falling female, seen from behind, with legs spread apart and bent 
sharply at the knees.&nbsp; The creature above her rump is exceedingly 
odd and thus invites speculation.&nbsp; Joseph Viscomi has suggested in 
correspondence that this is a goat, facing forward, left front hoof 
delineated, with symmetrically curving horns, a bifurcated forelock, 
floppy ears, bulging eyes, and a prominent muzzle.&nbsp; Is this a scene
 of interspecies coitus or rape?&nbsp; “The lust of the goat” (<em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>,
 E 36) has been the animal’s main emblematic characteristic since 
antiquity.&nbsp; As a symbol of the zodiacal sign of Capricorn, the goat
 is sometimes given a fish-like body with 2 twisting tails (see, for 
example, the <em>impresa</em> of Cosimo de’ Medici reproduced in James Hall, <em>Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art</em>,
 rev. ed. [New York: Icon Editions, 1974] 139).&nbsp; This tradition may
 account for the 2 tails in this drawing, 1 possibly wrapped around the 
woman’s left thigh and clearly visible right of her left knee, and 
another extending around her face and head and trailing along her 
back.&nbsp; Viscomi further suggests that Blake first drew a phallus 
penetrating the woman, then transformed it into a goat.&nbsp; This may 
account for the columnar shape of the animal’s body.&nbsp; The sexual 
implications of the design anticipate some of Blake’s drawings in the <em>Four Zoas</em>
 manuscript, begun c. 1796.&nbsp; The ovoid form above and to the left 
of the descending figure’s head remains mysterious.&nbsp; Not used in <em>America </em>or <em>Europe</em>, but probably executed in preparation for those books.<p></p>

<div>12. <em>Parental Affection, or the Meeting of a Family in Heaven</em>.&nbsp;
 Watercolor on laid paper, 14.3 x 9.2 cm.&nbsp; The title is apparently a
 recent invention, probably by the dealer Lowell Libson or one of his 
unnamed consultants.&nbsp; See <a href="#14">illus. 14</a> for the 
verso.&nbsp; When mounted in an album (see provenance below), the leaf 
to which the watercolor was attached was inscribed in pencil “Parents 
meeting.”&nbsp; Blake based the design on an emblem drawing in his 
Notebook, p. 41 (<a href="#13">illus. 13</a>).&nbsp; The major 
differences between the two versions are the addition of more background
 trees and the elaboration of the Gothic architecture in the 
watercolor.&nbsp; The date of the Notebook emblems is not certain, but 
they have generally been dated to c. 1790-92; some were engraved and 
published in <em>For Children: The Gates of Paradise</em> of 1793. <a href="#" id="example12-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('example12');return false;">Click to show more.</a><p></p>
<div id="example12" class="more" style="margin: 0; padding: 0">
<p>This watercolor is similar in style and mood to the wash drawings illustrating Mary Wollstonecraft’s <em>Original Stories from Real Life</em>
 (Butlin #244, dated c. 1791).&nbsp; A date of c. 1790-92 seems 
reasonable for this watercolor, although far from certain.&nbsp; The 
work shows some similarities to, but is more carefully executed than, a 
few drawings dated by Butlin to the late 1780s, including <em>An Enthroned Old Man Offering Two Children to Heaven</em> (Butlin #88) and <em>Age Teaching Youth</em> (Butlin #91).&nbsp; <em>Parental Affection</em> was advertised by Libson and reproduced in <em>Art Newspaper</em> no. 236 (June 2012); see also brief comments and illus. in Anon., “Forthcoming Events,” <em>British Art Journal</em> 13.1 (spring 2012): 96, Huon Mallalieu, “Drawn to Success,” <em>Country Life</em> 206.26 (27 June 2012): 112-13, Richard Green, “Master Drawings,” <em>Burlington Magazine</em> 154 (Sept. 2012): 651, and Mallalieu, “From the Zoo to the Big Apple,” <em>Country Life</em> 206.40 (2 Oct. 2012): 114-15.&nbsp; The work is in a remarkably fine state of preservation, the colors fresh and unfaded.</p>
<p>The reference in the title to “the Meeting of a Family in Heaven” implies a connection with Blake’s illus. to Robert Blair’s <em>The Grave</em>
 and perhaps a source for the subject in the writings of Emanuel 
Swedenborg.&nbsp; The latter would be appropriate for a work given or 
sold to C. A. Tulk, a Swedenborgian.&nbsp; The naturalistic landscape 
background, however, makes a heavenly setting unlikely.&nbsp; For an 
illus. of Blake’s “Meeting of a Family in Heaven” in the 1808 ed. of 
Blair’s poem and a discussion of its relationship to Swedenborg’s 
writings, see <em>Blake</em> 43.4 (spring 2010): 124-25.</p>
<p>Provenance: Probably acquired directly from Blake by Charles Augustus
 Tulk (1786-1849), although Blake’s wife, Catherine (after her husband’s
 death in 1827), or Tulk’s friend John Flaxman are possible sources; 
Tulk’s daughter Louisa Susanna Tulk (1819-48?), who mounted this 
watercolor in an album; by inheritance to her husband, James Peard Ley 
(1807-85); by inheritance to his son, James Verchild Ley; by inheritance
 to his son, James Richard Ley, who died in Feb. 2010; the estate of 
James Richard Ley (sole heir his daughter, Judith Penelope Ley, 
executors John Paul Hindle and Judith Penelope Ley); the entire album 
sold by the estate spring or early summer 2012 to the London dealer 
Lowell Libson Ltd. for an undisclosed price.&nbsp; This watercolor, or 
the leaf of recto/verso drawings reproduced here as <a href="#9">illus. 9-10</a>,
 might be the “drawing” which Nancy Flaxman, in a letter to her husband,
 John Flaxman, of July 1816, states was “bought … of him” (i.e., bought 
from Blake) by “our Friend,” possibly C. A. Tulk (<em>BR</em>[2] 326).
</p><p>The Tulk family album from which this watercolor was removed in 
2012 contains 90 pp. of Whatman paper, leaves 22.0 x 27.0 cm., bound in 
calf, according to a representative of the Tulk estate.&nbsp; It 
included other works by Blake (see <a href="#9">illus. 9-10</a>, <a href="#14">14</a>), Flaxman, and a good many drawings by other, probably Continental, artists.</p>

 (London: Scolar Press, 1982) 219. Only the inscribed texts, not the 
design itself, were altered (or at least recut with the graver) in later
 sts. and printings.  Schiavonetti and his journeymen must have worked 
very quickly to produce this print between Nov. 1805, the date of the 
prospectus naming Blake as the engraver of his designs in R. H. Cromek’s
 forthcoming ed. of <em>The Grave</em>, and Feb. 1806.  It was probably the 1<sup>st</sup>
 pl. to be produced by Schiavonetti, possibly intended for advertising 
purposes and as an immediate substitute for Blake’s own white-line 
etching of the design, rejected by Cromek.  The copperplate was trimmed 
from 35.7 x 20.3 cm. to 30.0 x 17.5 cm. before publication in Cromek’s 
1808 folio 1<sup>st</sup> ed. of <em>The Grave</em>.  The impression in 
my collection is on laid paper, leaf 39.2 x 24.8 cm., not the wove paper
 recorded in Essick and Paley.  An impression of this proof st. with a 
“J. Whatman, 1806” watermark, probably a wove paper, is recorded in A. 
G. B. Russell, <em>The Engravings of William Blake</em> (London: Grant Richards, 1912) 130, then in the collection of F. W. Bourdillon but now untraced.</span>&nbsp;

<p class="author"><em>Lady’s Monthly Museum</em>, vol. 12, Jan.-June 
1812.&nbsp; Panoply Books, Jan. online cat., contemporary (publisher’s?)
 half calf worn ($175).&nbsp; The June issue includes an anonymous 
review of the 5<sup>th</sup> annual exhibition of the Associated 
Painters in Water Colors (1812) with brief references to works Blake 
exhibited.&nbsp; The reviewer describes “No. 254” in the show, Blake’s 
tempera painting of <em>Sir Jeffery Chaucer and the Nine and Twenty Pilgrims on Their Journey to Canterbury</em> (Butlin #653), as
</p><blockquote>a picture of mongrel excellence; yet has such a 
repulsive appearance, that we doubt most of our fair readers will 
scarcely view it with pleasure, unless they should be well acquainted 
with <em>Aunciente</em> tapestrye, to enter into its merits.&nbsp; That 
it is the work of genius, no one will deny; it possesses all the truth, 
the costume, and manners of the times; and the artist is perhaps worthy 
of the highest commendation for his industry, research, and correctness;
 but for our parts, we feel ourselves so perfectly satisfied with the 
same subject, as treated by Stothard, that we wish not to possess a 
picture whose greatest merit seems to be an imitation of the arts in 
their degraded state. (344)</blockquote>
These comments indicate that the reviewer understood that Blake had 
integrated into his work features of style and format recalling (or 
reinventing) the pictorial arts of Chaucer’s time, yet the reviewer 
cannot accept such historical references because “the arts” were then in
 a “degraded state,” mockingly intimated by the faux-archaic spelling of
 “<em>Aunciente</em> tapestrye.”&nbsp; The reviewer apparently found the
 painting disturbingly old fashioned, but Blake was ahead of his time in
 his attempt at historical accuracy and in the appreciation of medieval 
(or at least pre-Raphaelite) painting and tapestry.&nbsp; The reviewer 
“declines giving any criticism” of “pictures 323 and 324, by the same 
artist [Blake],” because they are “too sublime for our comprehension,” 
but labels them as “Fuselian” and “Angelesque” (344).&nbsp; The works 
displayed as 324 were “Detached Specimens of an original illuminated 
Poem, entitled ‘<em>Jerusalem the Emanation of the Giant Albion’</em> ” 
(Associated Painters 1812 cat., 24).&nbsp; The reference to “323” is 
apparently an error; that work was a view of “Avo on the Alva, in the 
Siera Estrulla, Portugal” by “J. Shetky” (1812 cat., 24).&nbsp; As <em>BBS</em> 350 suggests, the reviewer may have intended to reference 279 and/or 280, Blake’s <em>The Spiritual Form of Pitt Guiding Behemoth</em> and <em>The Spiritual Form of Nelson Guiding Leviathan</em> (1812 cat., 21; Butlin #651, 649).

<div class="illus"><img src="611.jpg" height="487" width="600">
<div>18. Henry Fuseli.  <em>Fairy Mab</em>.  Oil, 70.0 x 91.0 cm., datable to 1793.  The design is based on a single line in Milton’s “L’Allegro”: “How <em>Faery Mab</em>
 the junkets eat.”  She seems to be enjoying her “junkets”—that is, 
sweet delicacies.  The crescent in her elaborate coiffure associates her
 with moon goddesses, or at least with the nighttime setting of Milton’s
 description.  Weinglass 350 (following Schiff—see below) describes the 
figure in the shadows upper right as Mab’s “dwarfish companion the 
Brownie.”  No brownie, a benevolent spirit or goblin in Scottish 
folklore (see <a href="http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/23858" target="_blank"><em>OED</em></a>),
 appears in Milton’s poem, although such a creature may have been 
suggested by the “Spicy Nut-brown Ale” consumed by those telling tales 
about Mab in “L’Allegro.”  Alternatively, the figure may be a 
personification of the ale that inspires faery visions.  Perhaps 
Mercutio’s powerfully imaginative description of “Queen Mab” in 
Shakespeare’s <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, act 1, scene 4, influenced 
Fuseli’s choice of subject.  An engraving of the design by William 
Raddon was published by Ackermann &amp; Co. in 1834 (Weinglass #305).
<p>Fuseli executed the painting for inclusion as no. 30 in his Milton Gallery.  For studies of this project, see Gert Schiff, <em>Johann Heinrich Füsslis Milton-Galerie</em> (Zurich: Fretz &amp; Wasmuth, 1963), this painting discussed p. 94, and Luisa Calè, <em>Fuseli’s Milton Gallery: “Turning Readers into Spectators”</em> (Oxford: Clarendon P, 2006), this painting not discussed.</p>

<div>19. Attributed to John Linnell.  <em>Shepherd and Sheep in a Landscape</em>.
  Oil, 31.0 x 46.0 cm., inscribed on the verso “retouched May 11/77 … 
John Linnell Snr.”  This dark, rather overworked painting is not 
characteristic of Linnell’s style.  Might this possibly be a rough oil 
sketch by Samuel Palmer “retouched” years later by Linnell?  There are 
at least some slight similarities between this work and Palmer’s oil and
 tempera paintings of the mid-1830s.  Such speculations could account 
for the price of £875, on an estimate of £100-200, fetched at BHO on 22 
Aug., #51. Some of the white dots in this reproduction, particularly 
upper left, are probably reflections from the varnish.<p></p>

 the ed. quoted in the pl.&nbsp; For the passage illus., see <em>Lettres de Milady Wortley Montague</em> (London and Paris: Duchesne, 1764) 2: 9-10, and <em>The Complete Letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu</em>,
 ed. Robert Halsband (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1965-67) 1: 349-50, letter 
about life in Turkey “To Lady Mar,” 18 April [1717]: “On a sofa … sat 
the Kahya’s Lady, … and at her feet sat 2 young Girls ….&nbsp; But they 
were hardly seen near the fair Fatima (for that was her Name), so much 
her beauty effac’d every thing ….&nbsp; She stood up to receive me [Lady
 Montagu], saluteing me after their fashion, putting her hand upon her 
Heart ….”&nbsp; Many 18<sup>th</sup>-century eds. of Montagu’s letters, 
first published in 1763, give the author’s name as “M-y W-y M-e.”&nbsp; 
The same design, reversed, was also engraved by James Parker, whose pl. 
is known to me only through a proof with signatures but before all other
 letters.&nbsp; Zancon’s engraving may have been copied from Parker’s,
