<p>8. John Flaxman. “Antigone Forced from Her Father,” an illus. to Sophocles, <em>Oedipus at Colonus</em>. Lithograph by Maria Denman, signed lower left “Drawn on Stone by Maria Denman, from a Sketch by John Flaxman Esq.<sup>r</sup> R.A.” and dated May 1827 in the imprint. Design within framing lines 9.5 x 16.0 cm., image including inscriptions 11.2 x 16.0 cm., leaf of wove paper 19.0 x 28.3 cm. showing part of a J W<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">ha</span>[<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">tman</span>] / 18[?] watermark. Essick collection. Oedipus clings to his daughter as 2 of Creon’s guards drag her away. Flaxman’s wash drawing of the design, 9.1 x 15.8 cm., is in the British Museum, accession no. 1888,0503.34. The only other impression of Denman’s print that I’ve been able to locate is also in the British Museum and is inscribed in pencil “The original drawing was bought by me at the Denman sale in 1862.” Denman was Flaxman’s sister-in-law and the copublisher of his Aeschylus and <em>Acts of Mercy</em> designs in 1831. Her drawing of Thomas Hayley’s portrait medallion of Romney was engraved by Caroline Watson and published in William Hayley’s <em>Life of George Romney</em> (1809).</p>
