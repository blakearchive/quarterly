          <p>This major loan exhibition will demonstrate the imaginative scope of
                        Blake’s interests, the high quality of his graphic art, and the
                        technical inventiveness into which he combined verse and illustration. It
                        will also explore new interpretations of his work in the light of the
                        intellectual and aesthetic currents of his times.</p>
          <p>David Bindman is the organizer of the exhibition and the author of its
                        illustrated catalogue. He has selected approximately two hundred works,
                        including a substantial number of the watercolor and tempera illustrations
                        to the Bible and the works of tempera illustrations to the Bible and the
                        works of Milton, Gray and Dante. One significant feature of the exhibition
                        will be the unique colored copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> The most
                        important of the “illuminated” books and individual color prints
                        will be represented by several copies in order to demonstrate the
                        development of Blake’s ideas throughout his working life.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">William Blake: His Art and Times</hi> will be the most
                        comprehensive exhibition of Blake’s work in North America in recent
                        years. It draws upon the extensive Blake holdings at Yale and in the
                        collection of Mr. Paul Mellon. The Tate Gallery and the British Museum are
                        foremost among foreign lenders. From Yale the exhibition will travel to the
                        Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto.</p>
