                    <p>Neither the Keynes nor the Bentley-Nurmi bibliographies list an early description, with
illustrations, of the Job series of engravings. W. Shaw Sparrow edited five volumes of illustrations to the
Bible for Hodder and Stoughton, London, n.d. (1904-7). The second of three volumes of Old Testament designs,
entitled Joshua to Job, reproduces the whole series of Blake’s engravings, with accompanying description by
the Rev. J. Macartney Wilson, M.A. entitled “The Book of Job”, which occupies pages 137 to 144. Though brief,
the comments are appreciative and intelligent, as can be seen by this sample:
<q>
“In the fifth picture there is still peace in the soul of Job, and he is seen giving of his poverty to a blind
beggar. At either side a beautiful angel watches the scene. A bare and rocky country stretches behind, with a
prehistoric stone erection instead of the Gothic temple. The sunset still lingers in the west. Below, all is
peace; above, all is disquiet. Once more the Satan appears, claiming this time to touch with evil plagues the
body of Job. Once more, but far more markedly than on the former occasion, the angels shrink back from him in
horror. The figure of the Almighty, the face full of pain, writhes on His seat, and the halo behind Him is
half-eclipsed. Below, in the margin, a hideous serpent is coiled: at the sides, angels weep over the flames
that rise, but cannot extinguish them.”
</q>
At the end of his comment on “When the morning Stars sang together” Wilson anticipates many reactions when he
says: “Anything in Art more beautiful than these four angels, more expressive of the glory and joy of life, I
do not know”.</p>
                    <p>Vol. IV of the Sparrow book, <hi rend="u">The Gospels</hi>, has “The Flight Into Egypt”
(Keynes 96b), and Vol. V, <hi rend="u">The Apostles</hi>, has three of the Blair designs.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps there are several useful sales catalogues not included in the bibliographies.
As they may contain reproductions not otherwise obtainable, a check-list would be helpful. One noted was put
out by Chas. J. Sawyer Ltd., of London, in 1936. <hi rend="u">Catalogue of Books</hi> No. 128 has a
reproduction of a pen and wash sketch called there “The Parable of the Sower”, but actually of a different
subject, perhaps “Pray ye therefore the Lord of the Harvest”, related to other drawings in the Tate Gallery
and the British Museum. Plate No.1, facing p.55.</p>
