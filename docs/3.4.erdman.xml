                    <p>1. Can anyone produce a convincing explanation of the following curious coincidence? It
is reported in a footnote on page 443 of the revised edition of Erdman’s BLAKE: PROPHET AGAINST EMPIRE
(paper &amp; cloth):</p>
                    <p> . . . a curious pair of entries in Crabb Robinson’s diary . . . suggest that
critical opinion somehow got from Flaxman to Blake at least as late as the latter part of 1814, after the
publication of Wordsworth’s <hi rend="u">Excursion.</hi> On Dec. 19, 1814, Flaxman heard Robinson read aloud
some passages out of the <hi rend="u">Excursion</hi> and “took umbrage at some mystical expressions . . . in
which Wordsworth talks of <hi rend="u">seeing Jehovah unalarmed.</hi> ‘If my brother had written that,’
said Flaxman, ‘I should say, “Burn it.”’” Flaxman and Lamb and Robinson debated the passage. Eleven years
later, Dec. 10, 1825, when Robinson first met Blake, the
<pb id="p03-106" n="106"/>
latter, evidently primed by the earlier debate, asked about Wordsworth’s Christianity and “said he had been
much pained by reading the Introduction to ‘The Excursion.’ It brought on a fit of illness. The passage
was produced and read . . . This ‘pass them unalarmed’ greatly offended Blake . . . Wordsworth was finally
set down as a Pagan; but still with high praise, as the greatest poet of the age.”</p>
                    <p>Does this mean that (as Erdman deduces) Flaxman told Blake what he thought of the
passage? Or that Blake read the <hi rend="u">Excursion</hi> when it came out and told Flaxman? Or neither?
What a brother’s keeper Flaxman was!</p>
