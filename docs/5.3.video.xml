                    <p>A videotape interpretation of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of
Albion</hi>, produced at York University and intended for use in the classroom, was shown on 29 December to
about thirty people at the MLA Annual Meeting in Chicago. After the showing there was a discussion led by the
director, Bob Wallace (York University), and by the writers of the script, Janet Warner (York University) and
John Sutherland (Colby College). The fifty-minute videotape was made in October 1971. It includes a dramatic
reading of the poem and interpretive commentary, and it uses graphics from Blake, Stedman’s 
<hi rend="i">Surinam</hi>, and a variety of other sources.</p>
                    <p>Shown here are three samples of graphics used in the videotape, plates from Capt. J. G.
Stedman’s <hi rend="i">Narrative of a five years’ expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</hi>
. . . , 2 vols., 80 pls. (London: J. Johnson &amp; J. Edwards, 1796). Stedman drew all the illustrations for
his book, and Blake engraved about sixteen of them, including the three shown here.</p>
