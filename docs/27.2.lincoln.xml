        <p>Since the publication of the Blake Trust/Tate Gallery edition of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence
and of Experience</hi>, my attention has been drawn to a sentence in the introduction that needs to be
corrected. I’d be grateful for the chance to set the record straight in the pages of 
<hi rend="i">Blake.</hi></p>
        <p>The sentence appears on page 14. It reads:
<q>
Early in his professional career he [Blake] was commissioned to engrave designs for <hi rend="i">The
Speaker</hi> (c1780), an anthology designed to ‘facilitate the improvement of Youth in reading and
Writing’, and for Mrs Barbauld’s <hi rend="i">Hymns in Prose for Children</hi> (1781).
</q>
As it stands this sentence might imply a commission for more than one illustration in each volume. I’d like
to make it clear that I know of no evidence that Blake was ever commissioned to engrave plates for the
Barbauld book, or that he was ever commissioned to engrave more than one plate for <hi rend="i">The
Speaker.</hi> (I can only account for this error by assuming that <hi rend="i">Hymns in Prose</hi> traveled
from my list of books Blake seems to have read to my list of books for which he produced illustrations.
Unfortunately I didn’t pick this up in the proof-reading state—or notice that the quotation from 
<hi rend="i">The Speaker</hi> was transcribed incorrectly.) The sentence should read as follows:
<q>
Early in his professional career he was commissioned to engrave a design for <hi rend="i">The Speaker</hi>
(c1780), an anthology designed to ‘facilitate the Improvement of Youth in Reading and Speaking.’
</q>
I’d also like to take this opportunity to apologize to Mark Bracher, whose name was twice mangled in the
edition.</p>
        <p>I’m grateful to G. E. Bentley, Jr., Robert Essick and David Fuller for pointing out these errors
to me.</p>
