                        A word on practical matters.  For the coming year, we have so far<lb/>

						<p>On another subject — reviews. When we began the <hi rend="i">Newsletter</hi>, we published no
reviews, on the assumption that Blake books were amply and expeditiously reviewed elsewhere. We soon
discovered that this was often not the case and that, besides, there existed a need for reviews aimed at a
more specialized audience. Our policy is to give reviewers complete freedom, both as to length and as to
opinion: there is no editorial policy concerning “rightness” of views, and the editor is of course not
responsible for the views of contributors. In addition, our pages are open for disagreement in form of
discussion articles. We would like to have a wide variety of reviews and reviewers, and we invite readers who
have published on Blake to correspond with us if they are interested in reviewing.</p>
						<p>This June issue contains once more the annual checklist of Blake scholarship. Its chief virtue, as we
have said before, is timeliness rather than completeness. It would, however, be more complete had more of you
sent offprints.</p>
