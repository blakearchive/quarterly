</div>
<div class="text"> <a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>
<p class="author">The 2014 Blake market began slowly. Through April, there were no rumors in the trade of anything substantial coming to market, much less actual sales of Blake’s drawings, paintings, or illuminated books. The calm persisted until 7 May, when I learned from John Windle that Bonhams London auction scheduled for 18 June would include posthumous copy i of <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> <span class="notecall">(<a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/view/essick484/essick484html#1">illus. <span style="white-space: nowrap">1-3</span></a>).</span><span class="fn">For the recent sale of posthumous copy p, see <em>Blake</em> 47.4 (spring 2014): <a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/viewArticle/essick474/essick474html#Songsp" target="_blank">pars. 2-3</a> and <a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/viewArticle/essick474/essick474html#3" target="_blank">illus. <span style="white-space: nowrap">3-5</span></a>.</span> Estimated at £50,000-70,000, the forty-four unbound plates were quickly knocked down at the low estimate (£62,500 with the 25% buyer’s premium) to the <span style="white-space: nowrap">E. J.</span> Pratt Library, Victoria University, Toronto, now the most active institutional collector of Blake and his circle.</p>
<a name="Stedman" id="Stedman"></a><p class="author">The draft of Bonhams catalogue entries sent to Windle included an “unpublished proof,” with a previously unrecorded “Blake” signature, of the title-page vignette for both volumes of John Gabriel Stedman’s <em>Narrative, of a Five Years’ Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</em>, a work for which Blake has long been known to have engraved sixteen full-page plates. This sent me scurrying to copies of the book. With the aid of a magnifying glass, I quickly found that the first published state of the vignette on the engraved title page to vol. 1 of the 1796 edition is clearly signed by Blake. Impressions of the second published state used for the vol. 2 title page also show a ghostly, barely visible signature. This is a remarkable instance of <span class="notecall">an engraving by Blake hidden in plain sight for over 150 years.</span><span class="fn">The presence of engravings by Blake in Stedman’s book was first recorded by William Michael Rossetti in his list of “Works Engraved but Not Designed by Blake” in Alexander Gilchrist, <em>Life of William Blake</em> (London: Macmillan, 1863) <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=o9oDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA260#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">2: 260</a>. Rossetti does not list the engravings individually but only states that there are “Fourteen Plates” by Blake. Thirteen full-page plates are signed by Blake; three unsigned plates have been attributed to him by 20<sup>th</sup>-century scholars. If Rossetti counted only plates signed by Blake, he may have noticed the “Blake” signature on the title-page vignette and included it among his “Fourteen.”</span> The proof was acquired by the Pratt Library for a hammer price of £4500 (£5625 with the buyer’s premium). See <a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/view/essick484/essick484html#6">illus. 6-10</a> and their captions for further information on this new attribution.</p>
<p class="author">On 9 July Sotheby’s London offered several lots of interest to collectors of Blake and his circle: two drawings by Fuseli, a drawing by Flaxman and two by Romney, two watercolors by Palmer, an oil painting by Calvert, and two watercolors by Blake, <em>Two Studies of a Baby’s Head</em> and <em>Pestilence, Probably the Great Plague of London</em> (<a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/view/essick484/essick484html#4">illus. 4</a>). The last, Blake’s earliest known version of this subject, had major condition issues. It had failed to sell at auction in 1982, but this time the drawing managed to fetch a hammer price at the low estimate of £20,000 (£25,000 including the buyer’s premium).</p>
<p class="author">Sotheran’s, the venerable London book dealer, issued a “William Blake” catalogue in October that includes Blake’s Job and Dante engravings, a selection of his commercial book illustrations, two etchings by Palmer, and a run of William Muir facsimiles of the illuminated books. Like Sotheran’s June 2008 catalogue of the same title, this sale was organized in partnership with John Windle. Although most of the original materials had been previously offered by Windle, their appearance in this important 2014 catalogue is recorded here.</p>
<p class="author">In early November Windle informed me that works by Blake from the collection of Maurice Sendak (1928–2012) would be coming to auction at Christie’s New York on 21 January 2015. Christie’s briefly listed the sale in its online auction calendar, but had taken it down by 19 November, <span class="notecall">apparently in response to a lawsuit filed by the Rosenbach Museum and Library against Sendak’s estate.</span><span class="fn">A news story about the lawsuit appeared in the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> on 9 Nov.; see &lt;﻿<a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/20141110_Rosenbach_sues_Sendak_Foundation_over_rare_books.html" target="_blank">http://​www.​philly.​com/​philly/​entertainment/​20141110_​Rosenbach_​sues_​Sendak_​Foundation_​over_​rare_​books.​html</a>﻿&gt;, accessed 11 Nov.</span> His will stipulates that his rare books should be given to the museum, but the executors of the estate define that category in a very narrow way. Disbound works, such as Sendak’s copy H of <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>, are not “books” in the estate’s opinion. Their even odder argument is that children’s books, presumably including <em>Songs of Innocence</em> copy J, are not “rare books.” On 2 December I learned from Richard Lloyd of Christie’s that the auction had been postponed until the parties to the suit settle or the court renders a decision. At least one work by Blake from Sendak’s collection, a copy of William Hayley’s 1805 <em>Ballads</em> with the plates hand colored, <span class="notecall">had been given to the Rosenbach before disagreement blossomed into litigation.</span><span class="fn">According to Peter Dobrin, “Bulk of Sendak Collection Leaving Rosenbach,” posted 15 Sept. 2014 by the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em>, &lt;﻿<a href="http://articles.philly.com/2014-09-15/news/53908526_1_rosenbach-museum-the-rosenbach-maurice-sendak-collection" target="_blank">http://​articles.​philly.​com/​2014-09-15/​news/​53908526_​1_​rosenbach-​museum-​the-​rosenbach-​maurice-​sendak-​collection</a>﻿&gt;, accessed 16 Sept. Dobrin’s headline refers to works by Sendak on deposit at the Rosenbach but now being returned to his estate. The Rosenbach Museum and Library sometimes uses a different name, “The Rosenbach of the Free Library of Philadelphia.” More information about the estate, its executors, and their plans for a Sendak museum is reported in Randy Kennedy, “Sendak’s Estate: Debating Where the Things Go,” <em>New York Times</em> 1 Dec., &lt;﻿<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/books/maurice-sendaks-estate-debating-where-the-things-go.html?emc=eta1&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">http://​www.​nytimes.​com/​2014/​12/​02/​books/​maurice-​sendaks-​estate-​debating-​where-​the-​things-​go.​html?emc=eta1&amp;_r=0</a>﻿&gt;, accessed 2 Dec.</span> For Sendak’s Blake holdings, see <em>Blake</em> 46.4 (spring 2013): <a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/viewArticle/essick464/essick464html#Sendak" target="_blank">par. 5</a>, 47.1 (summer 2013): <a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/viewArticle/bentley471/bentley471html#Sendak" target="_blank">par. 9</a>, and 47.4 (spring 2014): <a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/viewArticle/essick474/essick474html#Sendak" target="_blank">par. 7</a>. Fifty Mickey Mouse items from Sendak’s holdings went to auction on 15 July at Hake’s Americana &amp; Collectibles, Springettsbury Township, Pennsylvania. A “<a href="http://www.hakes.com/item.asp?Auction=212&amp;ItemNo=134426" target="_blank">Mickey Mouse rare double slate dancers German crank toy</a>” sold for $20,221.28.</p>
<p class="author">I continue to list plates by Blake’s engraving master, James Basire, appearing in two publications, <em>Eighty-Two Prints … from the Original Drawings of Guercino, in the Collection of His Majesty</em>, published by Boydell c. 1764(?), and Charles Rogers’s <em>Collection of Prints in Imitation of Drawings</em>, 1778. All the plates in the former, and most of those in the latter, were executed in Basire’s shop before Blake entered apprenticeship in August 1772, but these reproductions of drawings may have influenced Blake’s development of relief etching. He takes his master’s activities a step further. Relief etching permits the printing of images, drawn or painted directly on copperplates, to create what we might call “printed drawings”—along with the equally oxymoronic “printed manuscripts”—<span class="notecall">rather than prints “<em>in Imitation of Drawings</em>,” facsimiles, or reproductions.</span><span class="fn">For similar thoughts on the relationship between drawing and relief etching, see Joseph Viscomi, <em>Blake and the Idea of the Book</em> (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1993) 369-71.</span> Lithography, invented in 1796 by Alois Senefelder and called “polyautography” when brought to England early in the nineteenth century, offers a similar means of producing multiple copies of autographic compositions executed on the printing matrix.</p>
<p class="author">Beginning with the 2013 sales review, I no longer list separate plates and book illustrations for Blake’s circle and followers unless executed by the original artist. Exceptions are made for particularly important or rare works, such as large separate plates designed by Fuseli, discoveries, and plates by artists, such as Basire, of interest principally for their copy engravings. The coverage of Blake and Interesting Blakeana remains unchanged.</p>
<p class="author">The year of all sales and catalogues in the following lists is 2014 unless indicated otherwise. Most reports about auction catalogues are based on the online versions. Coverage of regional auctions is selective. Dates for dealers’ online catalogues are the dates accessed, not the dates of publication. Works offered online by dealers and previously listed in any one of the last four sales reviews are not repeated here. Most of the auction houses add their purchaser’s surcharge to the hammer price in their price lists. These net amounts are given here, following the official price lists. The value-added tax levied against the buyer’s surcharge in Britain is not included. Late 2014 sales will be covered in the 2015 review. I am grateful for help in compiling this review to G. E. Bentley, Jr., Nancy Bialler, David Bindman, Mark Crosby, William Dailey, Andrea Everett, Judith Guston, Donald Heald, Scott Krafft, Richard Lloyd, Nick Lott, Morton Paley, Miranda Rhys-Williams, Simon Roberts, Kevin Salatino, Annette Smith, Carmen Socknat, Joseph Viscomi, Patrick Williams, and John Windle. My special thanks go to Jenijoy La Belle, for assistance in all matters, and to Alexander Gourlay for his generosity in keeping me abreast of eBay auctions and for help with Blake’s handwriting. Once again, Sarah Jones’s editorial expertise and John Sullivan’s digital imaging have been invaluable.</p></div>

<p>The coloring of this impression is better, and more Blake-like, than one usually finds in tinted examples of posthumous copies of the <em>Songs</em>. The hand is distinct from the two coloring styles present in posthumous copy h. The thin, transparent washes in rose, blue, and yellow extending over the text and around the design are particularly unusual, perhaps unique, for a posthumous print and recall the presence of such tinting in lifetime impressions. Might Blake’s wife, Catherine, have been the colorist? Joseph Viscomi and I have speculated along those lines, but we have come to no firm conclusions. This leaf would appear to be the same Whatman 1831 paper used for all but pl. 48 in copy i. Mrs. Blake did not die until 18 Oct. 1831 (<em>BR</em>[2] 546), and thus it is possible for her to have worked on paper of that year. As William Michael Rossetti was the 1<sup>st</sup> to point out, she was probably responsible for much of the coloring in Blake’s illus. to John Bunyan’s <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em> of 1824-27 (Gilchrist <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=o9oDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">2: 235</a>, Butlin #829). There are some similarities between the darker, thicker coloring on those designs and this impression of pl. 23. For example, the mottled green of the grassy ground below the child and sheep is similar to the handling of the same (or very similar) color in the background foliage in <em>Christian Knocks at the Wicket Gate</em> (Butlin #829.10).</p>

<p>This 1<sup>st</sup> recorded version of Blake’s <em>Pestilence</em> design may have been part of a series of watercolors illustrating English history, including Butlin #51, 52, 53, 57, 60, 62, 64, and 67, all of about the same size. Blake listed the subjects of 7 of these works in his Notebook, among a group of 20 designs based on English history (E 672). In turn, he may have engraved (or intended to engrave) some of these subjects for “The History of England, a small book of Engravings,” known only from its listing in his 1793 advertisement “To the Public” (E 692-93). Blake developed his <em>Pestilence</em> design in a slightly larger watercolor datable to c. 1780-84 (Butlin #185). This second version lacks the inscription on the door upper left but would still seem to take its subject and setting from the great plague of London in 1665. Blake used the couple lower left, a version of the bellman, and the inscription on the door for the full-page design on <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=europe.k.illbk.06&amp;java=no" target="_blank">pl. 10</a> of <em>Europe a Prophecy</em>, 1794.

This impression from the <em>Appendix</em> included with the 1803 reissue of Earle’s <em>Treatise</em>, Essick collection. Etching/engraving, 2<sup>nd </sup>st. of 2, platemark 16.1 x 29.9 cm., leaf of wove paper without watermark 21.3 x 32.8 cm. The inscription top left, present in both sts. of the pl., is by an anonymous writing engraver; the inscriptions bottom center and lower right, added in this 2<sup>nd</sup> st., are in Blake’s hand. The letter forms, particularly the “g,” are characteristic of his engraved lettering—compare his inscriptions in George Cumberland, <em>Thoughts on Outline</em>, 1796. The barely visible blurred form top center is a weak impression of the collection stamp of the Birmingham Medical Institute, a former owner of the volume. I am grateful to Alexander Gourlay for his assistance in attributing the 2<sup>nd</sup> st. inscriptions to Blake. For another copy of the <em>Appendix</em> and comments on this pl., see “<a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/viewArticle/essick474/essick474html#Earle" target="_blank">Blake in the Marketplace, 2013</a>,” <em>Blake</em> 47.4 (spring 2014).</div>

<p>The newly discovered signature makes it certain that Blake engraved this vignette. His signature appears on 13 other pls. in Stedman’s book; 3 unsigned pls. have also been attributed to Blake’s hand (see <em>BB</em> #499 and <em>CB</em> 71-75). For records concerning Blake’s contacts with Stedman, see <em>BR</em>(2) 61-62, 66-70. Blake’s involvement with Stedman and his publication makes it highly unlikely that some other engraver named “Blake” executed this vignette.</p>
<p>The Latin inscription (the Stedman family motto, “my all is with me”) was executed in drypoint by Blake, not by a writing engraver. Like the other pls. in the book, this vignette was probably based on a drawing by Stedman. In comparison to the 1<sup>st</sup> published st. (<a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/view/essick484/essick484html#7">illus. 7-9</a>), this proof lacks the large flags attached to poles or aft masts on the sterns of the ships 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> from the left. Oddly, in the published st. the anchor lower right and the cannon barrel lower left have been recut to eliminate the crosshatching appearing in this proof. A small patch of crosshatching has also been deleted from the right extension of the flag dangling lower left.</p>
<p>According to Anon., <em>The Book of Family Crests</em>, 13<sup>th</sup> ed. (London: Reeves and Turner, 1882) 2: 442, “an anchor and cable,” traditional emblems of steadfastness, are part of the Stedman family crest.

A few crossing strokes have been added to the rope on the left where it hangs above the cannon. The clouds above the ships have been recut in a very different pattern. Diagonal hatching, apparently representing a cloud, has been cut into the space between the frame of the vignette and the flag upper left, just above and to the left of “mea” in the inscription. Many lines have been cut more deeply in the ocean, the ring fastening upper left, the lower tip of the anchor, and the Latin inscription.

<p>Identical letter forms, sizes, and positions indicate that the same copperplate was used for both title pages. The hand-colored, large-paper copy of the 1796 ed. in the Huntington Library has the same combination of sts.—vol. 1, 1<sup>st</sup> st., vol. 2, 2<sup>nd</sup> st.—found in all small-paper copies examined. In a hand-colored, large-paper copy in my collection, the title page to vol. 1 has the vignette in its 2<sup>nd</sup> st. Apparently the vignette was revised prior to the change in vol. number and at least this 1 impression pulled. It would not be surprising, however, to find this st. of the vol. 1 title in other copies, large and small paper. Next, a 2<sup>nd</sup> “I” was squeezed into the space between the first “I” in the vol. number and the following ruled line to create the title page for vol. 2 present in both large- and small-paper copies. This procedure is more efficient and cost effective than creating two distinct copperplates with only minor differences between them. The publishers of the 1796 ed. were probably not sufficiently prescient to know that there would be 2 further printings of the book and thus they anticipated only 1 required alteration in the title-page pl., from vol. 1 to vol. 2. For the 1806 ed., the date was changed, “J. Edwards” was replaced with “Th. Payne” as one of the publishers named in the imprint, and “<em>Second Edition corrected.</em>” was added below the volume designation. Impressions for the 1806 vol. 2 may have been pulled 1<sup>st</sup>, since the pl. presumably bore the “V<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 16px; line-height: 21px">ol.</span> II” inscription remaining from the 1796 printing, and then the 2<sup>nd</sup> “I” in the volume number was deleted before printing the title page for vol. 1. The vignette is still in its 2<sup>nd</sup> st., but the clouds above the ships are worn and Blake’s lightly scratched signature has completely worn away. The reverse procedure probably occurred for the production of the 1813 title pages, with the pl. for vol. 1, only the date having been changed, printed first and then converted to its vol. 2 st. Technically, these are all different sts. of the copperplate on which Blake etched and engraved his vignette, but only the early, 2-step change in the vignette itself—from the proof to the 1<sup>st</sup> published st., and from the 1<sup>st</sup> published st. to the 2<sup>nd</sup>—involved his work.

<p class="desc">There has been some uncertainty about which matrix was printed first in this ed., the letterpress texts or the engravings. Moss states that the “engravings were printed off first”; <span class="notecall">Easson and Essick claim that the letterpress came first.</span><span class="fn">W. E. Moss, “The Coloured Copies of Blake’s ‘Night Thoughts,’” <em>Blake</em> 2.2 (Sept. 1968): 19. Roger R. Easson and Robert N. Essick, <em>William Blake: Book Illustrator</em>, vol. 1 (Normal, IL: American Blake Foundation, 1972) 13.</span> Although it makes no mention of Blake or Young, Gaskell’s 2004 essay on the coordination between letterpress and copperplate printing offers important information on standard 17<sup>th</sup>- and 18<sup>th</sup>-century practices. He states unequivocally that, “whatever method was used to register the engravings in the text, the key bibliographical point is that the letterpress was printed first, <span class="notecall">and printed sheets with blank spaces would be delivered to the rolling press printer.”</span><span class="fn">Roger Gaskell, “Printing House and Engraving Shop,” <em>Book Collector</em> 53.2 (summer 2004): 231 (complete essay 213-51). Gaskell supports his conclusion with a reference to Martin Dominique Fertel, <em><a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1325424/f9.image" target="_blank">La science pratique de l’imprimerie</a></em> (Saint-Omer: Fertel, 1723). The relevant passage, not quoted by Gaskell, is probably the following: “Quand on veut mettre quelques <em>Vignettes</em>, <em>Fleurons</em>, ou <em>Armoiries</em> en taille douce dans l’impression d’un Livre, on doit observer de prendre leur juste grandeur, pour ne pas laisser moins de blanc, aux endroits où elles doivent être placées, qu’elles en contiendroient, afin que le Tailledoucier puisse imprimer ces Planches avec plus de facilité” (54-55). Rough literal translation: “When one wishes to place some vignettes, rosettes, or escutcheons on an impression of a book, one must keep their proper size by not leaving less blank space [than necessary] where they must be placed, which will contain them, so that the engraver [plate printer] is able to print those plates with the most facility.”</span> Gaskell’s discussion pertains to the printing of vignettes, headpieces, and other relatively small pls., not to the format of the 1797 <em>Night Thoughts</em> with the engravings surrounding the letterpress texts, but it seems likely that the customary sequence would nonetheless have been followed for this ed. Plate printers, according to Gaskell 230-31, habitually placed the leaf or leaves bearing letterpress face up on the bed of the rolling press to facilitate registration of engraved pls. face down on top of the paper. This procedure would not help to align Blake’s <em>Night Thoughts</em> pls. since they are about the same size as the leaves to be printed and thus the text would not be visible in the final stages of bringing copper and paper together. A plate printer’s normal method, with the pl. face up on the bed of the press and the paper placed over it, was probably followed for <em>Night Thoughts</em>. Given these unusual circumstances, it is not surprising that a line of the text sometimes appears above or below the outlined box meant to contain it.</p>

William Owen (or William Owen Pugh) commissioned Blake’s untraced painting <em>The Ancient Britons</em> (Butlin #657; see <em>BR</em>[2] 308 for the commission). This book may have influenced Blake’s comments on the painting in his 1809 <em>Descriptive Catalogue</em>. Owen states that “Arthur is the Great Bear, as the epithet literally implies: and perhaps, this constellation, being so near the pole, and visibly describing a circle in a small space, is the origin of the famous round table” (15). In a similar vein, but also mistaking a star for a constellation, Blake writes that “Arthur was a name for the constellation Arcturus, or Bootes, the Keeper of the North Pole” (<em>Descriptive Catalogue</em>, E 542). The constellation Boötes (sometimes confused with Ursa Major—Owen’s “Great Bear”) includes the star Arcturus, its name derived from a Greek word meaning guard of the bear.</p>

<p class="desc">The flat appearance of this impression, with no sense of relief to the printed lines when touched, suggests that it was subject to heavy pressure, possibly after having been cleaned by soaking in water, or that it is a true-size lithographic reproduction. I think it unlikely that someone would make such a convincing lithographic facsimile of this proof st., one that captures even the smallest scratches visible in impressions on laid India published in the 1808 folio issue of <em>The Grave</em>. Like the Keynes proof, however, this print does not contain some pitting of the copperplate, right of Blake’s upper left arm, that apparently occurred between the proof and published sts. The preponderance of the visual evidence, combined with the record of sales of unfinished proofs noted above, indicates that this is an impression from Schiavonetti’s copperplate.</p>

Malcolm Books, July online cat., publisher’s quarter calf detached, spine missing and replaced with plastic tape, “contents otherwise fair” (£52 to Essick). Includes Blake’s “To the Muses” from <em>Poetical Sketches</em>, retitled “The Poet Complains to the Muses of the Decline of Poetry,” pp. 75-76. “Blake” is given as the author on p. xii of the table of contents. Not in <em>BB</em> or <em>BBS</em>; the “Second Edition, Revised” of 1849 is recorded in G. E. Bentley, Jr., “William Blake and His Circle: A Checklist of Publications and Discoveries in 2009,” <em>Blake</em> 44.1 (summer 2010): 12. Lawrence’s <em>Poetical Primer; Consisting of Short Extracts from Ancient and Modern Authors</em> was 1<sup>st</sup> published in 1808. The 1849 ed. of <em>Cameos</em> appears to have been printed as a supplement to the 5<sup>th</sup> ed. of <em>Poetical Primer</em>, also 1849. The British Library online cat. includes an 1834 issue of <em>Cameos</em> and <em>WorldCat</em> lists an 1842 issue, but I have not seen these.</p>
<p class="desc">How did Lawrence, or anyone else involved in the production of <em>Cameos</em>, come upon a copy of “To the Muses” no later than 1831? Perhaps Lawrence knew Henry Crabb Robinson or his 1811 essay on Blake published in <em>Vaterländisches Museum</em> in which “To the Muses” is reprinted (<em>BB</em> #2538; see also <em>BR</em>[2] 585). In the 5<sup>th</sup> line of the poem, Blake’s “Heav’n” (E 417) is replaced by “heaven” in both <em>Cameos</em> and Robinson’s essay. Blake’s “chrystal,” line 9, is printed as “christal” by Robinson and “crystal” by Lawrence. The reprints substitute a comma and a period, respectively, for Blake’s exclamation marks as the terminal punctuation in the final 2 lines. Lawrence adds 2 unique variants, “bottom” for “bosom” (line 10) and “poesie” for “Poetry” (line 12). Based on these rather random variants, it is difficult to conclude that Lawrence’s version was based on the text in <em>Vaterländisches Museum</em>. G. E. Bentley, Jr., has pointed out to me that both <em>Poetical Sketches</em> and <em>Cameos</em> indent every other line of “To the Muses,” beginning with the 2<sup>nd</sup>, whereas Robinson does not. This is the best evidence that Lawrence had access to Blake’s book, possibly one of Crabb Robinson’s copies (see copies A and O, <em>BB</em> pp. 347, 351). There are no references to “Mrs. Lawrence” or “Rose Lawrence” in Robinson’s published diaries and correspondence, but he does refer to “Miss Lawrence” in 1821 and 1839; see <em>Henry Crabb Robinson on Books and Their Writers</em>, ed. Edith J. Morley, 3 vols. (London: Dent, 1938) 1: 265, 2: 572. Lawrence reprinted Blake’s “The Tiger [<em>sic</em>],” stripped of its final stanza and with several odd changes in wording (for example, “favour” for “fire,” line 6), in another edited collection, <em>Pictures, Scriptural and Historical, or, the Cabinet of History</em>, 1831.</p>

It is surprising to find a Continental publication of the 1850s listing Blake’s <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>, <em>America</em>, and <em>Europe</em>. Le Blanc also includes an entry for “Blake (<em>John</em>),” the “frère de W. Blake” who engraved pls. for “la Théogonie d’Hésiode: John Flaxmann. 1817” (1: 354). Blake had 2 brothers named John, but neither was an engraver (<em>BR</em>[2] xxx). Le Blanc indicates that his source for this misinformation is “Nagler, I, 522”—see <em>BB</em> #2267A, G. K. Nagler, <em>Neues allgemeines Künstler-Lexicon</em> (1835) 1: 522, “Blake, John, Bruder Williams.” The misattribution of the Hesiod pls. to John is probably based on mistaken announcements that Flaxman’s designs were to be engraved by “J. Blake”—see the <em>New Monthly Magazine</em> 2 (1 Jan. 1815): <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=b_YRAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA537&amp;ots=VDm4WlDBzR&amp;pg=PA537#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">537</a> and 7 (1 April 1817): <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=uzYaAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;ots=p4HrQJ-m2R&amp;pg=PA246#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">246</a>, the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> 28 (March 1817): <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Lvs7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA261#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">261</a> (latter 2 listed in <em>BB</em> p. 560), and the Feb. 1817 prospectus, <em>New Works Preparing for Publication, by Longman, Rees, Orme, and Brown</em>, p. 2. The “J. Blake” error is repeated, without his identification as William’s brother, in Friedrich Adolf Ebert, <em>Allgemeines bibliographisches Lexikon</em> (1821) 1: 605, and Ebert, <em>A General Bibliographical Dictionary</em> (1837) 1: 579 (<em>BB</em> #535A-B), entries on “Flaxman, J.”</p>
<p class="desc">Le Blanc, 1: 354, misattributes Blake’s portrait engraving of David Hartley, published in Hartley’s <em>Observations on Man</em> (1791), to “Blake (<em>C. J.</em>). Grav[eur]., Amateur.” The entry on this “Blake” notes that it is based on “Heineken, III, 2”—see <em>BB</em> #1823, [Karl Heinrich von Heinecken], <em>Dictionnaire des artistes, dont nous avons des estampes</em>, 4 vols. (Leipzig: Jean Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf, 1778-90). Vol. 3 of Heinecken, published in 1789, does not of course make any mention of the portrait of Hartley, but it includes the following entry: “C. J. Blake. Dame de distinction, qui a gravé en 1775 Le Portrait de son oncle, Sir Francis Blake Delaval” (p. 2). I have not found any later ed. of Heinecken; perhaps Le Blanc, who also lists the portrait of “Laval (Sir Francis de)” in the entry on C. J. Blake, is the origin of this erroneous attribution of the Hartley portrait.</p>

The Dec. issue, pp. 549-58, includes Winston Churchill, “Fifty Years Hence.” In the penultimate paragraph of the essay, he states that “the busy hands of the scientists are already fumbling with the keys of all the chambers hitherto forbidden to mankind. Without an equal growth of Mercy, Pity, Peace and Love, Science herself may destroy all that makes human life majestic and tolerable” (558). Churchill is borrowing from the opening lines of Blake’s “The Divine Image” in <em>Songs of Innocence</em>: “To Mercy Pity Peace and Love, / All pray in their distress” (E 12).</p>

<div>11. Blake’s “Jerusalem” lyric “From William Blake’s ‘Milton.’” Wood-engraved broadside, the text in white line, signed “H. C. Whaite” in the block lower right, signed “Henry Clarence Whaite” (British artist, 1895-1978) in pencil just above the bottom edge of the leaf (not shown) and dated “1963”(?). Image 18.4 x 11.9 cm., leaf of laid paper 30.7 x 24.4 cm. Essick collection. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> line, “mountains” in Blake’s text has been changed (inadvertently?) to “mountain.” Whaite’s landscape may be a response to the last line in the poem and the command “O clouds unfold!” (E 95), transformed into a performative utterance in the design. The broken forms on the horizon recall the cromlechs pictured in <em>Milton</em>, <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=milton.c.illbk.04&amp;java=no" target="_blank">pl. a</a>.

<div id="example12" class="more" style="margin: 0; padding: 0">
<p>The subject is taken from the exchange among Banquo, Macbeth, and the witches in Shakespeare’s <em>Macbeth</em>, act 1, scene 3. Fuseli captures Banquo’s description of the witches, each with her “choppy finger laying / Upon her skinny lips.” The arrangement of the “withered” hags, each of the first 2 on the right partly superimposed over her companion to the left, has classical and Renaissance precedents, but Fuseli’s use of this format may have influenced the way Blake represents Job’s three friends in his illus. to the book of Job, beginning with the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/blake-job-his-wife-and-his-friends-the-complaint-of-job-verso-jobs-wife-and-eight-other-n05200" target="_blank">wash drawing</a> of c. 1785 (Butlin #162 recto) and continuing through the engraved series published in 1826. Or might the influence be in the other direction? Fuseli famously declared that “Blake is d[amne]d good to steal from” (<em>BR</em>[2] 55). When Blake etched the three accusers of Socrates on <em>Jerusalem</em> <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=jerusalem.e.illbk.93&amp;java=no" target="_blank">pl. 93</a>, he overlapped them and configured their pointing hands and fingers in a manner similar to Fuseli’s witches.</p>
<p>According to the 2014 Jean-Luc Baroni cat. offering the Huntington <em>Three Witches</em> for sale, p. 54, the painting is “inscribed in Greek on the reverse of the relining canvas, probably a transcription of a now hidden text on the back of the original support: <em>These are Women but I call them Gorgons</em> (translation from Aeschylus’s <em>Eumenides</em>).” This inscription is repeated on the early, perhaps original, frame shown here. If indeed the canvas on which the painting was executed contained the same lettering, it may have been written by Fuseli as a classical antecedent to another of Banquo’s descriptions of the witches: “You should be women, / And yet your beards forbid me to interpret / That you are so.” There are no clear indications of facial hair in the Huntington painting, but tufts of hair on the chins, and at least slight indications of mustaches, are displayed by all three witches in the Kunsthaus example and Smith’s mezzotint. Both include a death’s-head hawkmoth, also absent from the Huntington version, left of the witches. Tomkins’s pl. includes the moth, but chin whiskers are given only to the witch furthest left.</p>

<a name="Sacrifice" id="Sacrifice"></a><p class="author"><em>Job’s Sacrifice</em>. Watercolor copy, 12.5 x 9.3 cm., of the pl. numbered 18 from Blake’s Job engravings. Crow’s auction, Dorking, 5 June, #943, illus. (£1100; estimate £120-180). The auction house, as well as a label by the Martyn Gregory Gallery on the back of the frame, attributes this work to John Linnell. The label also states that it is from the collection of “James Linnell, by descent to Mrs. Bollard, great grand-daughter of the artist.” Given the crudity of the drawing, I suspect that it is by James Linnell when young. Included in Martyn Gregory exhibition cat. #31, <em>John Linnell: Truth to Nature (A Centennial Exhibition)</em>, 8-20 Nov. 1982, #106, the illus. with right and left reversed. The entry in this cat. states that “it is possible that this drawing was worked on by one of the Linnell sons in 1842 though the refined quality of the outline also suggests the hand of John Linnell (Senior).” Differences between Blake’s design in the Linnell set of Job watercolors (Butlin #551.18) and the engraving indicate that this copy was based on the latter.</p>

<div>13.

Watercolor on Whatman paper with an 1833 watermark, 9.9 x 34.4 cm. The date of the paper, only 1 year before Stothard’s death, makes one suspicious that this is a very skilled copy of the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/stothard-the-pilgrimage-to-canterbury-engraved-by-louis-schiavonetti-and-james-heath-t06857" target="_blank">much larger pl.</a> of the same design published in 1817 or the <a href="http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/72904" target="_blank">small pl.</a> (4.9 x 17.4 cm.) engraved by <span style="white-space: nowrap">W. H.</span> Worthington in 1822. The differences between the engravings and the watercolor are very slight—for example, a variant arrangement of the clouds, particularly on the right, and the diminution of the shadows cast by the horses on the right. There is, however, nothing in the execution of this watercolor to indicate any hand other than Stothard’s. Its unfinished coloring might be explained by Stothard’s being hit by a carriage and incapacitated in fall 1833 (see M. G. Sullivan’s biography of Stothard in <em><a href="http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26603" target="_blank">ODNB</a></em>). Photo courtesy of Lowell Libson.</div>
