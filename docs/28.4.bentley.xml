                is taken to mean “an exact copy” attempting very close reproduction of an original
                named copy including size of image, color of printing (and of tinting if relevant),
                and size, color, and quality of paper, with no deliberate alteration as in page
                order or numbering or obscuring of paper defects. It may, however, include added

              him are listed in one place, with cross-references to their authors.</p>

                <hi rend="b">Division II: Blake’s Circle</hi>
              </title>
            </head>
            <p>The division is organized by individual (say, William Hayley or John Flaxman), with
              works by and about Blake’s friends and patrons, living individuals with whom he had
              significant direct and demonstrable contact. It will include Thomas Butts, Thomas
              Hartley Cromek, George Cumberland, John Flaxman and his family, Henry Fuseli, Thomas
              and William Hayley, John Linnell and his family, Samuel Palmer, James Parker, George
              Richmond, Thomas Stothard, and John Varley. It will <hi rend="i">not</hi> include
              important contemporaries with whom Blake’s contact was negligible or non-existent such
              as John Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke; such major figures are
              dealt with more comprehensively elsewhere, and the light they throw upon Blake is very
              dim.</p>
            <p>Reviews listed here are only for books which are substantially about Blake, not for
              those with only, say, a chapter on Blake. These reviews are listed under the book
              reviewed; the authors of the reviews may be recovered from the index.</p>
            <p>“Blake and His Circle” serves in part as an addendum to <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>
              (1977) and to <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (1995). I take 
                <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> and <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement, faute de mieux</hi>, to
              be the standard bibliographical authorities on Blake<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n2" type="note">2</ref> and have noted significant differences from them. 
                  <note id="n2"><hi rend="s">2</hi> Except for the states of the plates for Blake’s
commercial book
                engravings, where the standard authority is Robert N. Essick, <hi rend="i">William
                  Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations</hi> (1991).</note></p>
            <p>In general, Keiko Aoyama is responsible for works in Japanese, and I am greatly
              indebted to her for her meticulous accuracy and her patience in translating the words
              and conventions of Japan into our very different context. Note that a large number of
              Japanese publications, discovered through her initiative, are recorded here from 
                <hi rend="i">Blake Studies in Japan</hi> (1994) because they did not appear in 
                <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement.</hi></p>
            <p>I am grateful to many kind assistants, especially to Peter Amies, Keiko Aoyama, Keri
              Davies (for a pamphlet), Robert N. Essick, Michael Ferber, David Fuller, Donald John,
              Mary Lynn Johnson, Raymond Lister, Peter Morgan, Stewart Naunton, Morton Paley,
              Michael Phillips, Dennis Read, James Stanger, Joseph Viscomi, David Weinglass, David
              Worrall, and particularly to Dr. E. B. Bentley.</p>
            <p>The chief indices used to discover what relevant works have been published were the

            <p>By far the bulk of this checklist for 1994 derives first from over 300 items in
              Japanese discovered by Keiko Aoyama, many of them for years earlier than 1994, and
              second from addenda deriving from Joseph Viscomi’s magisterial <hi rend="i">William
                Blake and the Idea of the Book</hi> (1993).</p>
            <p>As usual, only a very small proportion of the publications in 1994 concerning Blake
              derives from study of original materials. Indeed, the editors of some of the editions
              below give no indication that they have seen any of Blake’s originals. And the vast
              majority of Blake criticism is concerned chiefly with other Blake criticism.</p>

            <p>There is very little to report concerning Blake’s writings. Only one leaf of prints
              from an Illuminated Book is known to have changed hands—<hi rend="i">Europe</hi> (c)
              pl. 11, 17 which gravitated to Robert N. Essic—and a number of minor editions were
              published. The next volumes of the Blake Trust series, though advertised for 1994, did
              not appear, but Dover reproduced the Blake Trust facsimile of the 
                <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (D) in reduced size and with other alterations. There were editions
              of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> in Catalan (1975) and Russian (1993), and somewhat
              miscellaneous editions of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Poems</hi> (1994—yet another Everyman
              edition), of <hi rend="i">William Blake</hi>, ed. Michael Mason (1994), and of the 
                <hi rend="i">Works</hi> [i.e., some of the poetry] of William Blake (1994) for the
              Wordsworth Poetry Library. None of these adds significantly to the knowledge or
              understanding of Blake.</p>

            <p>The only significant new work reproducing Blake’s art is Robert N. Essick’s fine book

            <p>Commercial Book Engravings</p>
            <p>Aside from new locations for some books with Blake’s commercial engravings (some of
              them rather uncommon), the chief additions to knowledge here are the record of yet
              another edition of Josephus with Blake’s plates and detailed publishing information
              about the edition of Shakespeare with illustrations by Fuseli which Blake engraved
              (1805).</p>
            <p>Catalogues and Exhibitions</p>
            <p>Essick arranged a major exhibition at the Huntington Library which was accompanied by
              a somewhat trifling catalogue and a fine book of reproductions (above). There was also
              an exhibition at the new House of William Blake which 
<pb id="p28-144" n="144"/>
              included “a prophetic cake.” Adam Mills devoted a whole catalogue to Blake, including
              some quite uncommon items, and <hi rend="i">Blake Studies in Japan</hi> recorded
              almost a thousand Japanese publications related to Blake.</p>

            <p>After the extraordinary Blake books of 1993, with the admirable new Blake Trust
              reproductions, E. P. Thompson’s <hi rend="i">Witness Against the Beast</hi>, and
              especially Joseph Viscomi’s <hi rend="i">William Blake and the Idea of the Book</hi>,
              any sequels are likely to be on a comparatively humbler scale of accomplishment. None
              of the Blake books listed below is in the same class with these, though David
              Weinglass’s catalogue raisonné of Fuseli is worthy of consideration in the same
              terms.</p>
            <p>David Linnell’s <hi rend="i">Blake, Palmer, Linnell and Co.:</hi> The Life of John
              Linnell is fairly remarkable in terms of using original materials, for it is based on
              the very voluminous Linnell Papers and Ivimy Mss., though almost all those relating to
              Blake appear to have been published before. The series of papers from the conference
              on <hi rend="i">Historicizing William Blake</hi>, ed. Steve Clark &amp; David Worrall
              contain a good deal of original matter, some of it directly related to Blake, and J.
              M. Q. Davies, <hi rend="i">Blake’s Milton Designs:</hi> The Dynamics of Meaning (1993)
              provides sound arguments on the entire range of Blake’s Milton illustrations. Andrew
              Solomon provides another analysis of <hi rend="i">Blake’s Job:</hi> A Message for our
              Time. Two revisions of theses, Marvin Lansverk, <hi rend="i">The Wisdom of Many, The

              and Jeanne Moskal, <hi rend="i">Blake, Ethics, and Forgiveness</hi>, discusses
              usefully an important aspect of Blake’s later thought.</p>
            <p>Even the wilder shores of Blake speculation and assertion were ill-populated in 1994.
              The best example may be the attack upon Patriarchal Criticism exemplified by the
              “almost rabid ferocity” of Robert F. Gleckner;<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref

            <p>Two of the most exciting developments were outside the field of Blake. One of the
              most impressive books for many years on Blake’s circle is D. H. Weinglass, 
                <hi rend="i">Prints and Engraved Illustrations By and After Henry Fuseli:</hi> A
              Catalogue Raisonné, which is in almost every respect a model of what such a work
              should be. In generosity of illustration and extensive transcription of documents such
              as prospectuses related to prints after Fuseli’s designs, it has few equals anywhere
              in publications concerning English art history. Indeed, so far as I know, only Blake
              is served so well.</p>
            <p>And finally the information that a volume of Joseph Johnson’s professional letters
              for 1795-1809 has unexpectedly survived<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n13"
type="note">13</ref> is very
              exciting indeed. Since Johnson commissioned many Blake engravings, and since the
              workings of his publishing-house have been very little known, this offers the prospect
              of considerably increased knowledge—and perhaps a fascinating book about the letters.

                  <p>Copperplate-Makers’ Marks</p>
                  <p>The manufacturers of copperplates of the kind used for engravings customarily
                    or at least frequently stamped the back of the sheet of metal with their name
                    and address, not unlike a watermark. The position of the mark is variable, and
                    often it is incomplete because applied at an angle and not flush with the metal.
                    Since such a mark defaced the copper, it prevented the use of that side for most
                    engraving purposes. However, since copper was (and is) very expensive, Blake
                    sometimes used the backs of copperplates for engraving his works in Illuminated
                      Printing.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref>
Indeed, it is likely that he
                    did so a good deal more frequently than surviving evidence indicates, for when a
                    large copperplate sheet was cut into, say, four pieces, the maker’s mark would
                    ordinarily be visible on only one of them<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n15" type="note">15</ref>
                    (just as a watermark will only appear on half or fewer of the leaves cut from a
                    sheet of watermarked paper), and, even when the copperplate-maker’s mark did
                    survive on the print, Blake ordinarily took pains to conceal it by printing very
                    lightly, by wiping ink from the area, and especially by coloring the area after
                    printing. Note that the copperplate-makers’ marks listed below are reported
                    chiefly from posthumous copies (<hi rend="i">America</hi> [N], 
                      <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> [I], <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> [H-J], <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>
                    [a-c, e, g, i, k]) which were printed more heavily and carelessly than Blake’s
                    own copies, and generally were not colored. When the copperplate-maker’s-mark is
                    visible on a print, of course it is in mirror-writing, and ordinarily it is very
                    difficult or impossible to decipher. <note id="n14"><hi rend="s">14</hi> No
                      copperplate-maker’s mark has been reported for any of his commercial

            </head>
            <p>“The Approach of Doom,” in which Blake adapted a design by his brother Robert, 
			<q>
                appears to have been Blake’s first attempt at drawing in an “impervious liquid,”
                perhaps shortly after his brother’s death in 1787, and it seems to have evolved out
                of a planographic transfer print. <hi rend="i">Doom</hi> may not have evolved
                directly, though. The vignette known as <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> plate a 
                  [<hi rend="i">a naked man being carried upwards by cherubs</hi>] may have been an
                intermediate step. [194] </q>
Similarly, the separate prints of “Joseph of Arimathea
              Preaching” and “Charity” 
			<q> seem to be early experiments in relief etching, which in
                turn suggest that <hi rend="i">illuminated printing</hi>, the printing of
                illuminated poems and books, evolved out of relief etching, which was motivated by
                the desire to duplicate drawings in facsimile rather than to publish preexistent
                texts. [195] </q></p>
            <p>Blake probably composed his designs for works in Illuminated Printing directly on the
              copperplate (as he did the marginal designs to <hi rend="i">Job</hi> about 1824),
              rather than transferring designs created separately, and he may well have composed
              some of the text for works in Illuminated Printing in this way also, particularly in
                <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi></p>
			<q> Blake’s text could not have been [<hi rend="i">mechanically</hi>] transferred and .
              . . preliminary studies or models of page designs could not have preexisted their
              execution . . . . In other words, Blake’s innovation lies not in writing backward or
              in inventing an “impervious liquid,” let alone a supposedly new method of transferring
              text, but in appropriating as a printmaker the tools, materials, process, and, most
              significantly, the aesthetics of sketching. [370] </q>
            <p>Blake scholars have often assumed that the creation of a work in Illuminated Printing
              was a very laborious and time-consuming process, but “A printable intaglio plate can
              be produced in about thirty minutes because the lines do not need to be etched deeply
              in order to print” (82).</p>

            </head>
            <p>Works in Illuminated Printing are printed from the surface of the copperplate (as in
              printing from conventional typography) rather than from the recesses incised in the
              copper, as in intaglio engraving and etching, and ordinarily different inks are used
              for printing relief and intaglio plates. However, in printing his relief plates 
			<q>
                Blake appears to have used an intaglio rather than relief ink. Intaglio ink
                consisted of pigment ground with various grades of burnt oil . . ., such as a walnut
                or linseed oil that had been boiled and then set on fire. Burnt oil was more viscous
                than boiled oil, making ink tacky and stiff. [95]<lb/>
<lb/>
 Postumous copies . . .
                were printed with far greater pressure and, it seems, with machine-made relief inks.
                [10] </q></p>
            <p>In printing his own works, Blake did not attempt to emulate the meticulous standards
              of his contemporaries, and he seems to have capitalized upon the irregularities of his
              printing. In a letter of 22 March 1911, the facsimilist William Muir calls Blake’s
              method “skilful <corr type="emend">carelessness,”</corr> and Essick 
              (<hi rend="i">William Blake and the Language of Adam</hi> [1989]) 
              says that Blake “expanded the circumference of the acceptable
              far beyond the limitations standard in the craft” (191).</p>
            <p>In ordinary printing, the printing surface (such as the copperplate) is placed face
              up on the bed of the press, and the paper is pressed down upon it. However, Blake
              appears to have placed the paper on the bed of the press, and the copperplate was
              imposed down upon the paper. For instance, 
			<q> Plates 7-12 in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>
                copy G have horizontal and vertical pencil lines (some partly erased) on their face
                that correspond to the size of the plates. If these lines were meant to register
                plate to paper, then the paper must have lain on 
<pb id="p28-146" n="146"/>
the
                press bed facing up and the plate placed on top of it, or the lines would not have
                been visible. This reverse printing method . . . would have prevented the paper from
                picking up any of the ink smudges in the shallows of the relief plate. Woodcuts were
                often printed [<hi rend="i">in relief</hi>] in this manner. [394] </q></p>
            <p>One of Blake’s problems was that his copperplates, even within the same work, were
              different sizes, and consequently the margins of facing pages have different
              dimensions.</p>
			<q> Given that registration was done by eye [<hi rend="i">i.e., not mechanically</hi>]
              and that plates were various sizes, diverse margins were inevitable. Facing pages with
              exactly shared margins, then, appear to be intentional. [105] </q>
            <p>In ordinary printing in conventional typography, several pages of type (a forme) are
              printed on one side of a sheet of paper; for instance, in a folio with two leaves per
              folded sheet of paper, pages 1 and 4 would be printed on the outside of the sheet and
              pages 2 and 3 on the inside. Blake used this method at least occasionally and perhaps
              regularly for the copies he printed on both recto and verso of the leaf.<ref
                target="n19" type="note">19</ref> For instance, the proofs of 
                <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (K) pl. 21-24 were printed with four prints on one piece of paper,
              and the untraced proof (L) with pl. 25-27 are evidently the same (p. 107). 
                <note id="n19"><hi rend="s">19</hi> In most surviving copies of Blake’s works in
                Illuminated Printing, each leaf is separate, not conjugate with its neighbor, but
                this may be the result of later trimming for binding rather than an indication of
                the manner in which the copperplates were printed.</note></p>
            <p>Occasionally he made mistakes. For instance, in <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (B),
<q>
                He printed plates 5 and 7 as an outside form (they are in the same ink) and plates 6
                and 8 as the corresponding inside form (they are also in the same ink). The leaf
                with plates 8 and 7 was reinserted into the binding, correctly, joined to the leaf
                with plates 5 and 6 by a strip of paper and stabbed three times with the other
                fourteen leaves. . . .Apparently Blake had forgotten which form he was inking when
                he printed these four plates.<lb/>
 Printing plates in folio format 
                  [<hi rend="i">i.e., four prints on a piece of paper folded once</hi>] on aligned leaves . .
.
                appears to have been Blake’s standard practice for books with facing pages, which .
                . . includes all copies of illuminated books produced between 1789 and 1793. [109]
			</q></p>
            <p>In his early printing, Blake carefully wiped the ink from the margins of the plates
              so that the designs would appear without frames. However, 
			<q> in 1795 . . . 
                  [<hi rend="i">Blake began</hi>] for the first time, to print the plate borders. . . .
                The borders invited or suited a more elaborate coloring style, since text and
                illustration were then framed and would have looked unfinished if the washes did not
                meet the border/frame. This is why washing and streaking the text—a method of
                washing that visually integrated text with illustration . . .—became common practice
                in books printed in and after 1795. [160-61] </q></p>
            <p>The evidence which Viscomi has so laboriously accumulated demonstrates abundantly
              that 
			<q> The times at which <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> claims Blake’s works were
                printed need to be adjusted, and the periods need to be redefined . . . This 
                  [<hi rend="i">first</hi>] period can be broken down . . . according to three distinct
                formats: recto/verso (1789 to 1793), color printing (1794 to 1795), and single-sided
                printing with borders and rich palettes (ca. 1795). After 1795 the format remained
                the same, though the coloring style continued to become richer and more elaborate.
                [372] </q></p>
            <p>Since each copy of a work in Illuminated Printing seems to differ from every other
              copy, Blake scholars have often carelessly assumed that Blake normally printed one
              copy at a time in deliberately unique ways. However, Blake’s early practice was to
              print half-a-dozen or more copies of each print at a time; “to imagine that
              illuminated books were produced one at a time makes illuminated printing and its
              inventor monstrously inefficient” (374). Prints were later—sometimes years
              later—collated into books, using the best prints first; at the end of the process,
              only the inferior prints were left, and sometimes in these the printing was so weak or
              careless that Blake had to touch them up or retrace designs or letters extensively in
              order to make them acceptable.</p>
			<q> Most copies of illuminated books were compiled from impressions printed and colored
              in small editions. That Blake used this mode of producing books requires one to
              question the intentionality and significance of most variations, redate copies of
              nearly all illuminated books, revaluate the role of illuminated poetry in Blake’s
              life, redefine his period and book styles, and, ultimately, reedit his work. [153]

              </title>
            </head>
            <p>The conventional commercial method of coloring prints was for each worker to add a
              separate color; one would add the red according to a master copy and pass the print on
              to another who would add blue, and so on. However, 
			<q> The limited palette used in
                early illuminated impressions suggests that labor was not divided according to the
                standard procedure of one color per person but by impression, and that Mrs. Blake
                colored entire impressions and books herself. [133] </q></p>
            <p>It has often been assumed that the time necessary to color a print was very
              extensive, but, at least for early copies, this is not so. The early coloring was
              simple, and 
			<q> In fact, many <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> impressions colored before
                1794, like “The School Boy, “Holy Thursday,” or “The Chimney Sweeper,” have only one
                or two broad washes, which represent quick passes of a brush and nothing more. There
                is no outlining in pen and ink, no overlaying of colors, no treatment that was
                technically difficult or time consuming. . . .<lb/>
 There is no reason to disbelieve
                  [<hi rend="i">Blake’s friends Frederick</hi>] Tatham or [<hi rend="i">J. T.</hi>]
                Smith about Mrs. Blake’s having regularly colored impressions, though the quality of
                her work appears not to have been as high as Tatham states—and 
                  <pb id="p28-147" n="147"/>
certainly not as high as Blake’s. Indeed, it is the very
unevenness of
                quality in many books that reveals the presence of two hands. [133] </q></p>
            <p>Catherine Blake probably colored <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (G-H), 
                <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (C, M, R [<hi rend="i">Experience</hi> only]) and early copies of 
                <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> and <hi rend="i">Visions.</hi></p>
			<q> I would even add to the list <hi rend="i">America</hi> copy K, which is loosely
              modeled on <hi rend="i">America</hi> copy A . . ., <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> copy C,
              and possibly <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy A; Mrs. Blake seems also to have helped in
              recoloring books, like <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy R, and coloring late copies, like
                <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy AA, ca. 1826. . . . [<hi rend="i">Such copies
              have</hi>] fewer colors, washes applied very flat and solid, and weak or incorrect
              modeling. The second hand is also characterized by a palette consisting primarily of
              pink, purple, bright blue, and yellowish green. With the exception of the
              frontispiece, the impressions in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy A reveal these traits.
              For example, in plate 14 . . . the pope is an opaquish purple, his throne is yellow
              gold, the cloud is pink and dark gray, the wings are bright blue, and the bodies are
              bright yellow with heavy black and gray washes. The gray and black washes in the cloud
              and garments are most revealing: they are crudely applied, following the lines of the
              forms but failing in their structural purpose of modeling those forms. . . . The
              coloring of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy A <hi rend="i">may</hi> be the work of Mrs.
              Blake, when she worked without a model; at the very least, it is not exclusively
              Blake’s. [133-34] </q>
            <p><hi rend="i">Visions</hi> pl. 7 (A-E, H-M)
<q> were printed in raw sienna, yellow
                ochre, and green ink as three issues of the same edition. The impressions from plate
                7 . . . share the same palette, brush work, coloring techniques, and one of three
                compositions. These compositions evolve one from the other and each composition
                includes impressions from at least two issues. The compositions are (1) purple
                clouds over light purple or blue sky, (2) purple clouds over a yellow sky with a
                rising (or setting?) sun, and (3) yellow sky with a rising (or setting?) sun with
                pronounced rays.<lb/>
                The first composition appears in copies H, C, B, and L. . . .,
                two copies printed in raw sienna <corr type="emend">and</corr> two in green. The second
composition is found
                in copies K, M, D, and E . . ., copies that were printed in all three colors. The
                third composition appears in copies I, J, and A . . ., one copy in yellow ochre and
                two in green. . . . The motifs, details, and coloring style appear to have been
                suggested by other impressions, since nothing in the original drawing (illus. 172)
                  [<hi rend="i">which is a proof of the etching</hi>] indicated sun or clouds or
                necessitated such simple coloring. [135]<lb/>
                <lb/>
                 [<hi rend="i">In Visions pl.
                  7</hi>] Theotormon’s right arm in copies C, E, J, K, L and M is cast in a purple
                shadow, with a touch of the same purple on the left elbow; technically, the shadow
                is one upward brush stroke, made in the same motion in nearly all of these copies. .
                . . [<hi rend="i">In Thel pl. 7</hi>,] The sky is formed in the same colors and
                manner in copies H, G, B, E, and M. Yet there is no printed line suggesting clouds;
                in copy O, printed years later, the background was painted in multiple bright colors
                to suggest twilight. The repetition of a form or gesture not part of the printed
                design suggests that it was generated by reference to other impressions, and thus
                sequentially and within an edition. [398]<lb/>
                 Mrs. Blake was probably responsible
                for the [<hi rend="i">Visions</hi>] copy C and H impressions, and possibly the copy
                L impression . . . [<hi rend="i">plus for pl. 7 still</hi>] copy M and probably copy
                K . . . [<hi rend="i">and</hi>] copies J and I. [142] </q></p>
            <p>Some copies of Blake’s works were colored after his death. These include

                decorations in <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> copy E; some posthumous copies were
                colored very well: <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy e (in imitation of

                <hi rend="i">No Natural Religion</hi> ca. 1794” (Viscomi, 229); no copy survives of the

            <p>Copies were apparently printed in 1793 (a [proofs] + loose proofs, C-I, K-L, R), 1795
              (A-B), ?1807 (M), 1821 (O), post-humous (N, P-Q) (Viscomi, 376-80).</p>
            <p>Viscomi, 389, reports a copperplate-maker’s mark on pl. 6 in copy M which I did not
              see when examining the original and cannot see in the Blake Trust facsimile of it
              (1963). N.b. Since <hi rend="i">America</hi> pl. 6 has a copperplate-maker’s mark 
                (<hi rend="i">BB</hi>, 86n4), it cannot be the recto of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> pl. 17
                (<hi rend="i">BB</hi>, 145), which also has a copperplate-maker’s mark (as Viscomi,
              389, points out). Keynes &amp; Wolf, <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Illuminated
                Books:</hi> A Census (1954) report a platemark on <hi rend="i">America</hi> (Q) pl.

			<q> In [<hi rend="i">America</hi>] plate 3 . . . the blemish next to the word “Dark” of
              line 11 appears in both copies A and B, though it is darker in A; the same is true of
              the blemish at the end of the tendril from the <hi rend="i">A</hi> in line 16 and the
              traces of ink in the shallows of the lower tree trunks and inside of the border. The
              sequentiality of the copies is even clearer in plate 5, where the bottom border is
              half-wiped in the same manner (and with the same gesture) in both copies, and the same
              wove pattern of the paper or backing blanket—a very distinctive mark—is present, as it
              is in the left bottom corner of plate 6 and in lower left and right corner of the
              flames in plate 12. [Viscomi, 392]<lb/>
<lb/>
 Plates 7-12 in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>
              copy G have horizontal and vertical pencil lines (some partly erased) on their face
              that correspond to the size of the plates. If these lines were meant to register plate
              to paper, then the paper must have lain on the press bed facing up and the plate
              placed on top of it, or the lines would not have been visible. This reverse printing
              method was used to print engravings on “paper, pastboard, Satin or any other thing you
              print upon” (Faithorne 70). In illuminated printing, it would have prevented the paper
              from picking up any of the ink smudges in the shallows of the relief plates. Woodcuts
              were often printed in this manner. [Viscomi, 394] </q>
            <p>Copy I</p>
            <p>Binding: (2) It was disbound by the winter of 1993-94, according to Anon., “Blake at

              98.</p>

            <p>The leaves were “trimmed and gilded along the top (<hi rend="i">pace BB</hi> 88)”
              (Viscomi, 312).</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Book of Ahania</hi> (1795)</p>
            <p>Both copies were apparently printed in 1795 (A-B) (Viscomi, 376).</p>
            <p>The six plates of <hi rend="i">Ahania</hi> are all 13.5 to 13.7 cm high by 9.8 to
              10.0 cm wide, while the five <hi rend="i">Book of Los</hi> plates are all identical in
              height and almost identical in width (9.8 to 9.9 cm). With little more evidence than
              these coincidences in size, <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 113, suggested that 
                <hi rend="i">Ahania</hi> pl. 2-6 “may have been” on the other sides of <hi rend="i">Book
                of Los</hi> pl. 3-4, 2, 5, 1 and Viscomi, 287, says that “The six 
                <hi rend="i">Ahania</hi> designs were executed on three plates, with plates 1 and 5, 6 and 2,
              and 3 and 4 etched back to back.”</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Book of Los</hi> (1795)</p>
            <p>Both copies were apparently printed in 1795 (A-B) (Viscomi, 376).</p>
            <p>Viscomi, 287, says that, pace <hi rend="i">BB</hi>, 113, <hi rend="i">Book of
                Los</hi> plates were not etched on the other sides of <hi rend="i">Ahania</hi> pl.
              2-6.</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> (1789[-1818])</p>
            <p>Copies were apparently printed in 1789-90 (a [proofs] + proofs, A-E, G-M, R, ?P, ?Q),
              1795 (F), 1818 (N-O) (Viscomi, 376-79).</p>
            <p>According to Viscomi, 
			<q> That the raw umber impression preceded the raw sienna
                impressions is verified by traces of the former ink in plate 7 of copy B, which
                indicates that the umber had not yet dried. On the other hand, traces of green ink
                on plates 4 and 8 of copies M and E indicate that green precede 
                [<hi rend="i">d</hi>] raw sienna for these plates. Raw sienna appears to have been followed by
                yellow ochre, in that plates 1 and 7 of copy D have traces of raw sienna. Moreover,
                plate 4 in copies E, B, and R are especially close: they share blemishes under the
                word “shrine” (line 2) and next to “spring” (line 9), and traces of ink along the
                inside top plate border. Plates 4 and 8 of copies M and E were probably the first
                pulls and printed together; that they are in different copies reinforce[<hi rend="i">s</hi>]
the theory that most copies of illuminated books were collated from piles
                of impressions and not produced individually. . . . [253]<lb/>

 Blake appears to
                have printed a pair of plates in the five colors before moving to a second pair;
                because the color sequence could vary among plate pairs, it is not possible to
                sequence the issues, let alone the copies, of the edition. . . . The five inks of
                  <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> required five different dabbers, otherwise one dabber would
                have had to have been cleaned five times for each plate pair. [254] </q></p>

              reveals embossments absent in the proof (copy a); these embossments suggest that the

              2, 19, and 28 which I did not record in my notes of the original and cannot find on

            <p>Copies were apparently printed in 1794 (H-I [proofs] A, C-F, J + separate pulls),
              1818 (G) (Viscomi, 376, 379).</p>
            <p>Pl. 4 in copies H-I 
			<q> appear certainly to have been printed with the impression in
                copy C: all three are printed in green ink with the illustration printed in shades
                of raw sienna and yellow ochre, the combination of inks characteristic of green
                copies C and F. These separate prints [<hi rend="i">in H-I</hi>] appear to have been
                extracted from copies E and F—or excluded from them when they were collated
                [Viscomi, 281].<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n27" type="note">27</ref>
	<note id="n27"><hi rend="s">27</hi> Viscomi argues that in <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> pl. 25 there are three
                  etched faces in copy A and that a fourth is added to the copper in copies C-D, F.
                  (“The added (or ‘middle’) faces is not ‘obscured’ in copy A (<hi rend="i">BB</hi>
                  179); it is simply not there” [413].) The absence of this fourth figure “in the
                  proofs and copy A and its presence in the other impressions indicate that the copy
                  A impression was the first pulled” (282). <p>However, this fourth figure (like the
                    others) appears only in the color-printing—of course we don’t know what was
                    etched—and in A it seems to be present but ill-defined. If the presence of three
                    or four figures is determined by the coloring, not the etching, the copperplate
                    of pl. 25 is not in two states, though the order of printing may be determined
                    by the presence or absence of this fourth figure in the coloring added in the

            <p>Pl. 17: In l. 21, “labour” was altered in pen to “labours” (“make himself fit for
              labours”) in copy B, probably not by Blake (Viscomi, 147).</p>
            <p>Pl. 18: In l. 36, “cry Hand” was changed in pen to “Cry Thou!” in copy B, probably
              not by Blake (Viscomi, 147).</p>
            <p>Pl. 20: The differences between the LC proof and copies A and C on the one hand and
              copies D-F, H-J on the other are created on the paper, not on the copper (pace 
                <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 237);
<q> flames in the top right corner are more
                extended in copies D-F and H-J than in copies A and C, with copy B being
                indetermined. . . . Yet one of the flames is extended further in copy C than in A,
                while another is extended further in both copies than in copy D—that is, their final
                shapes were determined by pen and ink finishing, and there is no change in the
                plate. [Viscomi, 342] </q></p>
            <p>Pl. 25: Toomey claimed that pl. 25 was in three states,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n29" type="note">29</ref> but in fact one “state” of the print is created by pen-and-ink changes;
              the plate “exists in two states instead of three, and copies A and C-D are in the
              first state and copies E and F are in the second” (Viscomi, 342).

                  <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>,” <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi>, VI (1972),
46-48.</note></p>
            <p>Copy A</p>
            <p>The copy bought by William Young Ottley was probably F (see below), rather than A (as
              in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 258).</p>
            <p>Copy F</p>
            <p>There are two sets of numbers in copy F, a shaky set in the second order in which
              Blake arranged the plates of Chapter II and a firm set in the first order: 
			<q> the
                firm and emended numbers are neither in Blake’s hand nor in the same medium as the
                weak numbers. The weak numbers (set 1) are in an intense black oil-based printing
                ink, while the firmly written numbers (set 2) are all in a light black water-based
                writing ink. [The set 1 numbers are completely opaque and shiny, while the set 2
                numbers are mostly a light black stain. The different media is 
                  [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] especially apparent in set 1 numbers that were gone over or repaired
in
                pen and ink.] The numbers of the first set are generally larger than those in the
                second set, but they are poorly formed, even ragged and wavering, an appearance
                caused in part by the viscous medium but also possibly by Blake’s weakened state.
                These numbers, though, are unmistakably Blake’s, whereas the 2s, 4s, 6s, and 9s of
                set 2 are distinctly and consistently different from Blake’s in all other
                books—including <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> copy I, which was executed a few months
                before <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> copy F. . . . For example, Blake’s 4 is always
                closed [<hi rend="i">or rather the top left member is at a sharp angle</hi>] and the
                stem of his 9 is always ex-tended and curved under. . . .<lb/>
<lb/>
 Blake’s numbers
                . . . are 2, 5, 6, 8 [gone over in pen and ink], 10, 13, 17, 22, 23; . . . 33, 34,
                36, 38, 40, 42, 43 . . . 52 [gone over in pen and ink], 56, 57 [the 7 is Blake’s and
                looks like an 8], 63, 64, 65, 66, 70 . . . 77, 82, 88, 89, 96. The rest of the
                numbers are in set 2. </q></p>
            <p>The second, firm set of numbers, sometimes altering the first, is by Linnell,
              following the (first) order of the plates in his own copy of 
                <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (C).</p>
			<q> Linnell appears, then, to have received a partially numbered copy of 
                <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> in loose leaves, which required him to finish numbering the pages
in
              pen and ink, using his own copy, copy C, as the model. . . . perhaps what reveals copy
              C as the model and Linnell’s hand most clearly is the Chinese white used extensively
              in plates 39, 76, 84, 87, 99, and 100 to create highlights and to model figures. This
              pigment was not used in any other copy of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (or any other
              illuminated book that I know of) except [<hi rend="i">Linnell’s copy</hi>] C ( . .
              .plates 32 and 47). . . . </q>
            <p>It is not clear why Blake numbered only 29 plates, a few in each chapter, “But what
              is clear is his intention regarding this copy’s order: he meant it to follow copies D
              and E, an intention that Linnell apparently ignored or 
              misunderstood.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n30" type="note">30</ref>

            <p>History: (1) It is probably copy F (not copy A, as in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>,

                Records</hi> [1969], 594, 341, 347); Linnell probably collected the loose leaves of

              delivered them to Ottley, with whose library they were sold at Sotheby’s, 21 July

              are exactly the same,” thus proving that they were printed at the same time (Viscomi,

            <p><hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (1790-1827)</p>
            <p>Copies were apparently printed in 1790 (K-M [proofs], A, C, B, H), 1794 (E-F), 1795
              (D), 1818 (G), 1827 (I) (Viscomi, 376-80).</p>
            <p>The conventional dating of the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> has long been c. 1790-93,
              but, according to Viscomi, 
			<q> In the course of 1790, apparently within two or
                possibly three different but not necessarily widely separated plate-making sessions,
                Blake wrote and executed three sets of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> plates. Plates
                1-3, 5-6, 11-13, and 21-24 have the rightward <hi rend="i">g</hi><ref target="n31"
                  type="note">31</ref> and appear to have been written first; [II] plates 4, 7-10,
                and 14-20 have the leftward <hi rend="i">g</hi> and appear to have been written
                second. . . . [III] Plates 25-27 (“A Song of Liberty”) appear to have originated as
                an autonomous work, which was attached to the narrative as a kind of coda. . .
                .<lb/>
 Plate 7 is the transitional plate . . ., with its first <hi rend="i">g</hi>
                tilting to the right like the <hi rend="i">g</hi> in plates 5 and 6, and its second
                  [<hi rend="i">in the same line!</hi>] and subsequent <hi rend="i">g</hi>s tilting
                to the left. . . .<lb/>
 Most of the [<hi rend="i">copperplate</hi>] sheets for 
                  <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> were approximately 30 × 21 cm. Most of the sheets can be
                reconstructed according to the self-contained units; plates 16-19, for example,
                share the same widths and heights and together form one 33.0 × 20.7 cm sheet, while
                plates 7-10 were probably cut out of one 30.1 × 20.7 sheet. It is therefore
                significant when plates made from the same sheet have both kinds of 
                  <hi rend="i">g</hi>, as with plates 12, 13, 20, and 27, which appear to have been etched on
                the backsides of four plates cut from the 29.7 × 21 cm plate used for 
                  <hi rend="i">Doom.</hi> Plates 12 and 13 form a self-contained unit with the rightward 
                  <hi rend="i">g</hi>, and plates 20 and 27 both end sections (14-20, 25-27) that are
                self-contained but have differently formed <hi rend="i">g</hi>’s. Assuming that the
                plates were prepared at the same time, it follows that their texts were probably
                written close to each other in time as well. In other words, if the use of the two
                  <hi rend="i">g</hi>’s did not overlap in <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>, then the one
                could not have been employed very far from the other. . . .<lb/>
 Apparently they
                  [<hi rend="i">both kinds of</hi> g] overlapped with one another and with the
                serifless <hi rend="i">g</hi> of the <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> plates, which showed up
                in nine of the twenty-seven plates of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>. . . .<lb/>
 The new
                leftward <hi rend="i">g</hi> was most likely introduced after the rightward 
                  <hi rend="i">g</hi>, and, regardless if early use was variable or exclusive, the new
                  <hi rend="i">g</hi> made its first appearance in <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> plates 1
                and 8 and in the second set of <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> plates, presumably in late
                1789 or early 1790.[237] <note id="n31"><hi rend="s">31</hi> D. V. Erdman, “Dating

                  (1969), 8-13, had argued that Blake formed his “g” with an unconventional leftward
                  serif at the top from “the middle of 1791” until between “Nov 5 1802 . . . and
                  March 25 1804” or until 18 June 1805, and made a rightward serif before and after
                  these dates, but “Erdman’s hypotheses . . . on the formation of Blake’s 
                    <hi rend="i">g</hi> . . . are wrong” (Viscomi, 234); see also “Blake’s Sinister

              copies G and I; “The traces of ink on plate 10 of copy B . . . and especially those in
              plate 11 . . . reveal that the ink was wiped off the forms to prevent them from
              printing . . . The [<hi rend="i">cave and rock</hi>] forms are also revealed as slight
              embossments in the versos of copies A and F.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref

                Viscomi, 109; Blake seems to have been printing the work as if it were a folio, with
                two prints on each side of the paper: “He printed plates 5 and 7 as an outside form

            <p>Copy A</p>
            <p>History: (1) Probably acquired by Philip Hurd, in whose posthumous sale by Evans on
              30 July 1845, Lot 162 it was described as “Blake’s Illustrations of Milton, &amp;c.
              COLOURED PLATES, 1834 [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>],” when it sold to Bohn for £6.17.6.<ref
                target="n35" type="note">35</ref>
	<note id="n35"><hi rend="s">35</hi> The date is of
                course wrong, perhaps a misprint for the “1804” on the titlepage. The fact that the
                work is described as “PLATES” indicates that it consists of prints rather than
                watercolor designs for a poem by Milton, such as <hi rend="i">Comus. Milton</hi> (A)
                was bound in half Green morocco, like <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (A) which was Lot
                161 in Hurd’s 1845 sale &lt;<hi rend="i">BBS</hi> 86&gt;.</note></p>
            <p>Copy C</p>
            <p>According to Viscomi, 
			<q> The single frame line given the plates in copy C—the only
                copy of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> with frame lines—indicates that copy C was probably
                finished in or after 1818, when this stylistic feature first began to be used. . . .
                Copy C, in other words, was reworked and restructured more than once, probably
                before and certainly after—but not at the same time as—copy D.<lb/>
 In copy C,
                plates a-e can be divided into two sets. The leaves of plates a, b, and d are
                slightly smaller than the others and were apparently cut with a knife, whereas the
                other leaves were torn in the usual manner from larger sheets. The bottom edges of
                these leaves are only half gilt because they were not level with the other leaves. .
                . . plates 4,7,25, and 41 . . . are watermarked “WHATMAN / 1808”; in all four the
                mark runs vertically at the outside edge of the leaf, either from bottom corner up
                to the middle of the leaf (4 and 25) or from the top corner down to middle of the
                leaf (7 and 41). The “1808” is positioned under “HATM”; the “8” is 1.75 cm high,
and
                the “W” is 3.0 cm high. Plates c and e, which were printed on slightly thinner
                paper, are recorded as having the same mark (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> 305), but in them
                the mark is smaller and runs horizontally across the top right corner. The marks are
                fragments: “J W” in plate e and “TMAN” with an “8” under the “T” in plate c.
The “8”
                is 1.6 cm high and the “W” is 2.25 cm high. The size of the “W” and size and
                position of the “8” <corr type="emend">correspond</corr> exactly to the “J WHATMAN /
1818” paper used in 
                  <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy V and the first copies of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi>
                (The Whatman 1824 and 1826 papers used in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> copy F have an
                “8” that is 1.7 cm high.) . . . [<hi rend="i">The numbers echo these
                divisions.</hi>] Plates b, a, and d were numbered 2, 3, and 17, whereas plates c and
                e were numbered 8* and 32*, denoted as supplementary plates. The first set of plates
                were [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] numbered in pen and ink like the other impressions, but
                plates c and e were numbered in an oil-based printing ink and are ragged-looking.
                These five plates were added to <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> C after it was initially
                collated. All five extra plates, along with plate f, were numbered integrally with
                copy D, ca. 1818, at which time plate 2 was not printed. [325-26]<ref target="n36"

	<note id="n36"><hi rend="s">36</hi> Viscomi, 328, argues that
                  Wainewright’s copy of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> was copy C, not copy B as in 
                    <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 319. However, in his letter of 28 March 1826,
                  Wainewright says that in the copy of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> which he has “lately
                  purchased” “The Title says in <hi rend="i">12</hi> books” (<hi rend="i">Blake
                    Records</hi> [1969], 327), and this is only true in copies B and D, and copy D
                  was “finished” for Mr. Vine, not for Wainewright.</note></q>

            <p>According to Viscomi, 336, “The Order” was made not for James Vine, whose copy of the

            <p><hi rend="i">Song of Los</hi> (1795)</p>
            <p>Both copies were apparently printed in 1795 (A-B) (Viscomi, 376).</p>
            <p>According to Viscomi, 
			<q> The sequence of plate 4 impressions can be established by
                tracing the changes in the cloud line trailing from the <hi rend="i">A</hi> in
                “Albion” in the last line. It is printed in the gray of the text in copy C, as are
                the birds. This is the first impression pulled. The second impression is copy F; the
                plate is again inked in gray and painted in colors, only here the trailing line is
                half-wiped, its lower portion is dabbed in red, and the birds are wiped away. The
                third impression, copy D, has the same gray and red cloud line, and the birds have
                been reinserted in a dark brown. In the fourth impression, copy A, Blake dabbed the
                top portion of the cloud line blue. In the fifth, copy B, the cloud line is printed
                in blue, the gap between Los’s head and the cloud is filled in, and the birds are
                reinked in brown. The sixth and last impression pulled was copy E; there are traces
                of the blue ink, but here Blake has color printed the shallow between the cloud and
                the woman’s head in red. This has to be the last copy, since the red ink is
                substantial enough to have left traces in subsequent impressions. The sequence of
                impressions for plate 4 is not the same as that for plate 1, which can be traced
                according to the color, disappearance, and reappearance of the birds. Their order
                appears to be copies F, B, A, C, D, and E. Essick found a slightly different order
                  (<hi rend="i">Printmaker</hi> 129), but the point remains the same: the different
                printing orders of plates 1 and 4 indicate that copies were collated from sets of
                impressions and not printed one at a time. [287] </q></p>

            <p>Copy E</p>
            <p>Binding: (4) It was disbound by the winter of 1993-94, according to Anon., “Blake at
              the Huntington, Fall 1994,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, XXVII, 3 (Winter 1993-94),
              98.</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi> (1794-1802)</p>
            <p>Copies were apparently printed in 1794 (<hi rend="i">F</hi>, G-H, 
                <hi rend="i">T</hi><hi rend="s">1</hi>; <hi rend="i">B-E</hi>), 1795 (<hi rend="i">J, O,
              S</hi>), 1802 (<hi rend="i">P, Q</hi>) (Viscomi, 376-77). Note that numbers of copies
              of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> were produced separately but later added to 
                <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> to form <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of
                Experience.</hi></p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (B-D), “The Little Girl Lost” and “The Little Girl Found”
              (pl. 34-36) were “borrowed from copies of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>,” but in 
                <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (A, R) they are printed integrally with 
                <hi rend="i">Experience.</hi> However, “in both copies A and R, plate 34 was printed in the
ink
              of <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> but plates 35-36 are in the ink of 
                <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>, as though Blake momentarily forgot about the transfer”
(Viscomi,
              294, 415).</p>
            <p>Significant Variants</p>
            <p>Pl. 9: In the first plate for “The Little Black Boy,” 
			<q> From the earliest to the
                last impressions . . ., which were produced ca. 1795 and ca. 1825, the woman’s back
                is arched and her hair is in a bun. This is how Blake drew her on the plate. In all
                posthumous copies . . ., her back and hair have been altered on the plate. [Viscomi,
                248] </q></p>
            <p>There does indeed seem to be a difference, though the “bun” is at the bottom of her
              neck or the top of her shoulder rather than on her head (where one might expect to
              find a “bun”). There seem to be very faint traces in the posthumous copies of the
              former larger outline.</p>
            <p>Pl. 12: In “The Chimney Sweeper” of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> in copy AA, the first
              word of l. 20 (“And the Angel told Tom if he’d be a good boy / He’d have God for his
              father &amp; never want joy”) was changed in pen to “But” (“But have God . . .”); the
              change, “which makes little sense,” may have been made by Catherine Blake, who perhaps
              helped in the coloring of this copy (Viscomi, 146).</p>
            <p>Pl. 25: According to Viscomi, 
			<q> “Infant Joy” . . . in [<hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>]
                copy U is an unrecorded first state: the bottom of the <hi rend="i">J</hi> of “Joy”
                crosses into the flower in this but not in any of the subsequent copies. . . . The
                presence of this first state and the very poor inking throughout the book indicate
                that copy U was the first copy of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> printed. [245-46]
			</q></p>
            <p>In Viscomi’s reproductions (illus. 251-52, 274-77) of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (N)
              and <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (C, I, L, O), the “J” appears to be merely colored over,
              but in posthumous copies b (reproduced in the edition of Ruthven Todd [N.Y., 1947])
              and c (reproduced in <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Writings</hi>, ed. G.E. Bentley, Jr.
              [1978], 48) it is clear that the curve of the “J” crossing the petal was removed from
              the copperplate.</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> (1789[-1808?])</p>
            <p>Copies were apparently printed in 1789 (E, V ?; <hi rend="i">F</hi>, I-J, X; A-H,
              K-M, Z, <hi rend="i">B-E</hi>), 1795 (<hi rend="i">J</hi>, N), 1802

                <note id="n38"><hi rend="s">38</hi><hi rend="i"> Innocence</hi> (R/Y) was apparently
                printed as one copy but was later separated into two fragments.</note></p>
            <p>Printing: In early copies, “Many of the impressions contain the same accidentals.
              ‘The Lamb’ of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy E . . ., for example, has the same
              traces of ink along the inside of the wiped border as ‘The Lamb’ in 
                <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy B . . . and other copies” (Viscomi, 115). Similarly,
<q> an
ink
                blot in the leaves beside stanza one of “Night” (plate 20) occurs with diminishing
                strength in <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy E, <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy I, and
                  <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy F, which reveals that the three impressions shared
                the same ink, dabbers, paper, and printing pressure. [Viscomi, 243] </q></p>
            <p>Copy I</p>
            <p>Binding: (3) It was disbound by the winter of 1993-94, according to Anon., “Blake at
              the Huntington, Fall 1994,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, XXVII, 3 (Winter 1993-94),
              98.</p>
            <p>Copy R/Y</p>
            <p>According to Viscomi, 
			<q> The facts that three of the nine extant impressions of 
                  <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy R are blue and that all nine impressions constitute
                thirteen [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] impressions missing from copy Y strongly suggest
                that these two fragmented copies once formed a single copy. . . . The paper size of
                  <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copies Y and R is the same, approximately 20 × 15 cm,
                but what proves conclusively that the two copies were once joined is the fact that
                both sets of impressions were stabbed three times, 2.8 and 3.4 cm 
                apart.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n39" type="note">39</ref> Copy Y/R was
presumably broken up while in the
                Dimsdale family, perhaps at the time of or because of the fire damage. If so, then
                  <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> Y/R was first acquired by someone other than the first
                Baron Dimsdale, since it was produced after the baron died. [308]

            <p>Copy T</p>
            <p>According to Viscomi, 
			<q> The plates of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy T . . . were
                printed posthumously and colored in imitation of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy B.
                For example, the figures in “The Ecchoing Green” plates 1 and 2 are colored in the
                same five and eight colors as copy B; the difference is that in plate 1 the old man
                and the faces are pink in copy T and white in copy B. The shapes and colors (blue,
                pink, and orange) of the very distinct tripart [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] sky of
                “Spring” plate 1 are duplicated exactly, as are the shapes and colors (blue and
                pink) of the sky in “The Shepherd.” Copy T also imitates the plate order of copy B,
                except that the frontispiece and title plate are reversed and plates 53 and 15 are
                missing. The coloring model is not always so readily apparent because the
                undercoloring in imitation of copy B was touched up and supplemented with
                superfluous ornamentation and because an early coloring style was combined with a
                late printing style. [247] </q>

            <p>Copies were apparently printed in 1795 (A, R; I, L, O/K, M, W/N, BB<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n40"

              the coloring of K and M is also posthumous) (Viscomi, 376-81). 
                  <note id="n40"><hi rend="s">40</hi> Copies A and R were produced in a different print-run
from the

            <p>According to Viscomi, “The Sick Rose,” “The Garden of Love,” “The Little Vagabond,”
              and “Infant Sorrow” (pl. 39, 44-45, 48) were etched on four plates cut from “the full
              22.2 × 13.7 cm sheet” (270) of copper. The fact that these four poems are not included
              in <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (F-H, T<hi rend="s">1</hi>)
<q> signifies that these
                specific plates had not yet been prepared, that the sheet had not yet been cut,
                which in turn indicates that copies F-H and T1 were printed before copies B-E, which
                include these plates. [270] </q></p>
            <p>Therefore copies F-H, T<hi rend="s">1</hi> “were the first copies of 
                <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> printed.”</p>
            <p><hi rend="i">Experience</hi> (B-E) were color-printed from the surface only (unlike
              F-H, T<hi rend="s">1</hi> which are color-printed from both surface and shallows)
              because they had to match back-to-back <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> prints, and
              shallow-printed designs can only be printed on one side of the leaf.</p>
            <p>Coloring: Viscomi says that 
			<q> the stream at the bottom of “The Lamb” 
                  [<hi rend="i">pl. 8</hi>] and “The Little Black Boy” (plate 2) [<hi rend="i">pl.

                painted as green ground (in the same green color) in both <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>
                copy L and <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy N, which strongly indicates that the one
                was painted with reference to the other, and thus at the same time. 
                  <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> copy L was acquired by 1799 (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> 417), which means
                that both copies were colored between 1795 and 1799. [416] </q></p>

			<q> Though they are possibly the work of Mrs. Blake, the frames [<hi rend="i">in W and
                Y</hi>] were not added after Blake’s death, since the numbers are Blake’s and they
              were written after the frames were drawn, as their placement out of the way of the
              scrolls and flourishes makes evident. Blake intended the designs to be framed more
              elaborately than ever before, and he may have drawn a few of the frames himself 
                [<hi rend="i">as he did for Job</hi>]. [Viscomi, 366] </q>

                Under “89” is “37” written in another hand and ink, which, as suggested by its

<q> but
                not all were colored similarly. Indeed, at least two colorists were involved. The
                two sets are similar only in that both are richly colored and use gold, but the
                colors in the thirteen impressions are deeper, more opaque, and were applied with a
                drier brush.<lb/>

                useful new information about the imitations, such as that “In copy J, ‘Brentano’s

                  does; Blake cannot be “either transmitter or formulator of the story of Jesus in
                  Britain” (79), for the legend does not seem to be older than the nineteenth

                <p>Tim Heath is creating in 17 South Molton Street a Blakean “centre for radical
                  thought,” for “the dissenting imagination,” called “The House of William Blake,”
                  “a fully commercial operation” for innovation in business, which will publish
                  books, hold exhibitions, and be a center for a Blake society.</p>
                <p>A separate press release of 11 April 1994 for The House of William Blake says
                  that it is 
				<q> commissioning contemporary Artists to decorate Blake’s original
                    lodgings in a way which best expresses Blake’s curious spirit today. The
                    exhibition [<hi rend="i">1-14 August 1994</hi>] will include the work of those
                    working in the fields of furniture design, poetry, kitchen ware, textiles,
                    bathrooms, book binding, printing, engraving and cake-making amongst others. A
                    Catalogue to accompany the exhibition will be available from late July. Most
                    exhibits will be for sale and some may be eaten. . . . We will also be putting
                    on some Children’s Summer Holiday Workshops during the Exhibition Period.
