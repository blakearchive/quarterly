                    <p>AILEEN Ward, “Building <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>: Composition and Chronology,”
<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 39.4 (spring 2006): 183-185, concludes that the “new Prophecy” of Blake with “60
Plates” referred to by George Cumberland in 1807 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>[2] 246)<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n13" type="note">1</ref> “cannot have been <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> [as we have
it], and can therefore only have been <hi rend="i">Milton.</hi>” However, <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> as we
have it consists of a maximum of only 50 plates, not the 60 of Cumberland’s reference. <note id="n13">1. 
<hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2) refers to <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale UP, 2004), 
<hi rend="i">BB</hi> to <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1977), and citations of Blake are from
<hi rend="i">William Blake’s Writings</hi>, 2 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1978).</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>She places “<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> firmly in the decade of the 1810s” and
dismisses the plain “1804” on its title page as merely evidence of Blake’s “desire to link the two
poems” <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, which are both dated 1804 on their title
pages.</p>
                    <p>Her evidence that there cannot have been 60 plates of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
finished in 1807 derives chiefly from internal evidence of a post-1807 date on more than 50 of the 100 plates
of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> The character “Hand” appears on 26 <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
plates,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n14" type="note">2</ref> and Hand, with his “Three
Brains in contradictory council” (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl. 70, 1. 5) and his three pointing hands
(pl. 93), is generally agreed to represent Robert, John, and Leigh Hunt in whose <hi rend="i">Examiner</hi>
Blake was anonymously and recklessly attacked on 7 August 1808 and 17 September 1809 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>[2]
258-61, 282-85). These 26 plates must have been finished after 1807. Further, <hi rend="i">BB</hi> p. 228
cites 37 <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> plates<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n15"
type="note">3</ref> which are anomalous (in terms of size, density of errata, erroneous catchwords, etc.) as
suggesting lateness. However, the connection of odd plates with lateness is not very secure. Perhaps the 26
plates with Hand and 14 of the odd plates were finished after 1807. <note id="n14">2.

Hand).</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>There is a good deal of evidence that <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> as presently
constituted differs from previous versions. The simplest evidence is the title-page reference to a work “In
XXVIII Chapters” (rather than the present four chapters) and the “End of the 1<hi rend="s">st</hi>
Chap:” on plate 14, whereas the last words of chapter 1 are now on plate 25.</p>
                    <p>Further, watermarks on some proofs suggest an early date: EDMEADS &amp; [PINE] on 
<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> plate 9 and EDMEADS &amp; PINE 1802 on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> (F) duplicate
plates 28, 45, 56, plus a loose plate 28. These two watermarks also appear in <hi rend="i">Songs of
Innocence</hi> (Q), which Joseph Viscomi, <hi rend="i">Blake and the Idea of the Book</hi> (1993) 243, 378,
dates c. 1804.</p>
                    <p>Is there evidence for <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> before 1807 aside from the title-page
date of 1804 and vague references in his letters to “My long Poem” (e.g., 25 April 1803)? Well, some of
the events in it were of 1790-1803:
<q>
I heard in Lambeths shades [where Blake lived 1790-1800];<lb/>
In Felpham [1800-03] I heard and saw the Visions of Albion[.]<lb/>
I write in South Molton Street [1803-21] what I both see<lb/>
and hear .... (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl. 38, ll. 40-42)
</q>
Some characters in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> derive from his trials for sedition of 1803 and 1804,
particularly the references to Privates Scofield and Cock who accused him, Lieutenant Hulton who preferred the
charges, and Justices of the Peace Brereton, Peachey, and Quantock who heard the charges.<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n16" type="note">4</ref>
                        <note id="n16">4. Brereton, Cock, Hulton, Peachey, Quantock, and Scofield appear in
various spellings on <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pls. 5, 7-8, 11, 15, 17, 19, 22, 32, 36, 43, 51, 58, 60,
67-68, 71, and 90.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>There is clear evidence that <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> depicts some events of
1790-1804, and the “1804” on the title page clearly implies that the work was written and probably at
least partly etched then. It is exceedingly difficult to ascertain what <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> consisted
of in 1804 or even in 1807, but it is very likely that some of it was committed to paper and to copper in
1804.</p>
