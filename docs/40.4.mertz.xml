          <p>In April 1821, the antiquarian and collector Francis Douce (1757-1834)
                        acquired <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> (B), an early and
                        unique copy that includes the monochrome intaglio etching “The
                        Accusers” (B) as its frontispiece.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n4" type="note">1</ref> While it is not clear whether Douce acquired these two works
                        gathered together in the present binding, <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>
                        does not appear in Douce’s lists of books sent to be bound between
                        April 1821 and his death.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n5"
type="note">2</ref> As I note in
                        “An Unrecorded Copy of Blake’s 1809 Chaucer
                        Prospectus,” Douce listed his acquisitions in a set of three
                        notebooks entitled “Collecta,” which show that he obtained
                        “Blake’s marr. of heaven &amp; hell” from
                        “Dyer” (a name that regularly appears in these notebooks).<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n6" type="note">3</ref> The fact that Douce did not write the
                        full name of this source in the “Collecta” has provoked
                        speculation about his identity. In the second edition of <hi rend="i">Blake
                            Records</hi>, G. E. Bentley, Jr., suggests that the “former owner
                        was probably Lamb’s friend George Dyer.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n7" type="note">4</ref> However, this must be an oversight because Bentley
                        notes elsewhere in <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> that Douce’s
                        friend Isaac D’Israeli (1766-1848) wrote to a “M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Dyer”
requesting “as soon as possible a copy of
                        Blake’s Young” (i.e., <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>),<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n8" type="note">5</ref> and suggests that “Dyer”
                        could be Gilbert Dyer, “probably the same Dyer from whom Francis
                        Douce acquired <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> (B) in April 1821.”<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n9" type="note">6</ref> Essick likewise suggests Gilbert Dyer as
                        a possible source of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> (B), though he considers
                        it more likely that Douce’s “Dyer” was “the
                        London printseller Charles George Dyer.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n10" type="note">7</ref> Finally, Joan Stemmler, noting the prior comments of Bentley
                        and Essick, assumes that the identity of “Dyer” is
                        self-evident: “That by ‘Dyer’ is meant Gilbert Dyer,
                        the bookseller to Dibdin and D’Israeli, seems certain.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n11" type="note">8</ref> While the idea that Gilbert Dyer sold
                        Douce his copy of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> has been raised by others,
                        it now stands on more solid ground than earlier commentators may have
                        realized. My review of letters and notebooks from the Douce collection, as
                        well as the fact that Douce’s bibliophile friends D’Israeli
                        and Thomas Frognall Dibdin (1776-1847) knew of Dyer or dealt with him,
                        provides further evidence supporting the conjectural identification by
                        Bentley and Essick of the bookselling business of Gilbert Dyer of Exeter as
                        the source of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> (B). <note id="n4">1. G. E.

          <p>The name “Dyer” first appears in the “Collecta”
                        for September 1808, when Douce acquired “A batch of prints of

On at least
                        twenty-eight separate occasions between 1808 and 1825, Douce obtained
                        various items from a source always identified simply as
                        “Dyer,” the last entry appearing in November 1825 (“6

                        details of his acquisitions from Dyer, for instance noting the receipt of
                        “Six front[ispieces] by Stodart &amp; Westall &amp;c. Orig. edit.

          <p>The likely purveyor of the majority of these books, drawings and prints,
                        Gilbert Dyer (bap. 1743, d. 1820), worked as a schoolmaster, operated a
                        circulating library, published four books, and established a bookselling
                        business on Exeter’s High Street by 1793.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n22" type="note">19</ref> After his death, Dyer’s son, also called
                        Gilbert (born 1776), succeeded him as bookseller and continued to trade on
                        High Street until selling the business to William Strong of Bristol around
                        the beginning of 1829.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n23"
type="note">20</ref> Consequently,
                        Douce dealt with both father and son, but the bulk of his acquisitions falls

          <p>Douce’s acquisition of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> from Gilbert
                        Dyer raises several questions. First, how did an early copy of
                        Blake’s illuminated book reach Devon? As provincial booksellers, the
                        Dyers certainly would have dealt with agents in London, such as Thomas
                        Ostell of Ave Maria Lane (noted above), who co-published 
<pb id="p40-149" n="149"/>
Dyer’s <hi rend="i">Restoration of the Ancient Modes of
                            Bestowing Names</hi> and received payment in his behalf from Douce in
                        1805. Conceivably, Dyer continued the relationship with the successors to
                        Ostell, C. Cradock and W. Joy (though I have not been able to confirm
                            this).<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n37" type="note">34</ref>
If Dyer acquired <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> (B) directly from a local or regional owner
                        rather than through a London agent, could Blake’s Cornish friend and
                        patron, the antiquarian John Sidney Hawkins (bap. 1758, d. 1842) have had a
                        hand in its appearance in Exeter? In 1783, John Flaxman obtained a
                        commission for Blake to produce “a capital drawing” for
                        Hawkins, who apparently ordered more drawings and planned to raise a
                        subscription to send Blake “to finish [his] studies in
                            Rome.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n38" type="note">35</ref>
In September 1800,
                        Blake informed George Cumberland that “I have shewn your Bonasoni to
                            M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Hawkins my friend,”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n39" type="note">36</ref> and in October 1804 he also mentioned to William
                        Hayley “[o]ur good and kind friend Hawkins” and “his
                        former kindness to me” (E 756). Although none of Blake’s
                        drawings for Hawkins has been identified or traced,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n40" type="note">37</ref> it appears that Blake’s friendly
                        relationship with his patron continued from 1783 through at least 1804.
                        Since nothing is known of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> (B) between the
                        time of its production and April 1821, perhaps Hawkins can provide the
                        missing link. <note id="n37">34. Ostell may have died around 1808, as

          <p>Second, does the acquisition of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> from a dealer
                        who with few exceptions sold Douce drawings and prints suggest that Douce
                        was interested in the graphic rather than the literary component of
                        Blake’s works? Bearing in mind that Douce’s Blake collection
                        consisted of <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> (I), <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> (B),
                        the first ballad from <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads</hi>

                        large folio copies printed on one side of the leaf”), Joseph Viscomi
                        has speculated that “D’Israeli’s interest in the
                        illuminated books appears to have been primarily pictorial rather than
                            literary,”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n46"

                        have influenced Douce’s interest in Blake. Similarly, Dibdin’s

                        focuses on “the bizarre but original and impressive ornaments by
                        Blake” for <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> and refers only
                        superficially to his poetry.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n47"

          <p>In the absence of a Dyer catalogue, c. 1821, offering Blake’s book and
                        “The Accusers” for sale, materials in the Douce collection as
                        well as his connections with D’Israeli and Dibdin seem to confirm the
                        idea raised by Bentley and Essick that Douce acquired this unique and early
                        copy of <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>, possibly in its present binding,
                        from the Dyer bookshop. Although Dibdin’s works are marred by
                        inaccuracies and infelicities, my investigation suggests that we can safely
                        agree with his claim in <hi rend="i">Bibliomania</hi> concerning the
                        “value and singularity” of many volumes offered for sale by
                        Dyer, especially as <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi> (B) has a place among the
                        most valuable and singular books ever produced.</p>
