David Erdman (State University of New York, Stony Brook), so in turn we wrote to him for a complete inventory.
From December 1973 through March 1974 he tells us that he visited eleven campuses and gave sixteen talks. The
talks were “Blake’s <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>,” “Blake’s <hi rend="i">Song of Los</hi>,” “Blake and the
Burden of the Present,” “Blake in and out of His Perishing Body,” and “Coleridge as Concerned Spectator [i.e.,
as news commentator],” and “Wordsworth’s <hi rend="i">Prelude</hi> as Ark.” The talks were given in various
combinations at the following places and times: Brown University (13 December), University of Minnesota and
University of Alberta (16 January), University of Iowa (23-24 January), University of Chicago (28 January),
University of Puget Sound (26 February), University of Oregon (27 February), University of California,
Berkeley (1 March, 4 March), University of California, La Jolla (11 March), University of Southern California
(13 March), Claremont Graduate School (14 March).</p>
