<p class="title">William Blake (1757–1827): Visiones en el arte británico. CaixaForum Madrid, 4 July–21 October 2012.</p>
<p class="byline">Reviewed by Michelle Ferreira</p>
<p class="note"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Michelle Ferreira</span>
 is a teacher, translator, and freelance writer currently living in 
Madrid. She graduated with a master’s degree in literature in 2010 from 
Ryerson University and also assisted with the Blake in Our Time 
symposium held at the University of Toronto in 2010.</p>
</div>
<div class="text">
<p>In the long, heat-filled days that compose a typical Spanish summer, 
an exhibition of William Blake’s work appeared in Madrid, the first in 
Spain since 1996. A collaboration between Spain’s La Caixa 
Foundation—also the organizers of the nation’s first showing of Blake in
 1996—and Tate Britain, the exhibition presented Blake as a leading icon
 of British art, a rebel artist who inspired subsequent generations of 
artists.</p>
<p>The venue is an interesting starting point. La Caixa is essentially a
 savings bank, its logo designed by Joan Miró, which operates as a 
nonprofit bank among dozens of such banks in Spain, whose collective 
mission is to give back to communities by investing in public welfare 
projects including scientific, cultural, social, and research programs. 
The CaixaForum, a four-story converted electrical building with a mass 
of reddish-orange oxidized iron as its crown, is juxtaposed nicely with 
the greenery of Spain’s largest vertical garden, designed by French 
botanist Patrick Blanc, and is located in the center of Madrid, steps 
away from the Prado.</p>
<p>The exhibition displayed works by Blake ranging from engravings to 
watercolors to prints and temperas, covering the breadth of his artistic
 career. Over eighty works, mostly from the Tate’s collection, 
demonstrated his range in terms of size, method, and theme. According to
 the exhibition materials, the intent was to highlight Blake as “one of 
the most influential figures” in British cultural history, a visionary 
who anticipated the artistic movements that followed, namely the 
Pre-Raphaelite, neoromantic, and postmodern movements. The annotated 
journey through the artist’s creative vision ended with a review of his 
artistic legacy.</p>
<div class="illus"><img src="761.jpg" height="375" width="600">

<p>For me, the journey began with a primarily visual sensation: the 
color of the walls, a striking aubergine emblazoned with red-toned text 
for headlines, seemed to have been chosen to set off the textured whites
 and yellows in nearly all of Blake’s work exhibited. Visitors were 
greeted at the entrance by Thomas Phillips’s 1807 portrait of Blake 
hanging on the dark purple wall of the anteroom, and then moved through 
the exhibition’s twelve sections and subsections, labeled in both 
Spanish and English, all of which served to impress upon the viewer that
 Blake was a versatile artist who experimented widely with technique, 
medium, and theme. The exhibit was organized thematically rather than 
chronologically in order to articulate its premise that Blake stood 
apart from other artists of his time.</p>
<p>Sections highlighted his various methods and thematic concentrations.
 The first, emphasizing his early artistic life as an apprentice, was 
disappointing in that it featured only two pieces that were not 
engravings. However, these pieces served as a starting point for the 
assertion that Blake was, even in his early career after his time at the
 Royal Academy, unconventional in the production of ideas through his 
art. His <em>Age Teaching Youth</em> (c. 1785-90), a small meditative 
work where the humanized figures of experience and innocence sit side by
 side, was juxtaposed with the more conventional <em>Oberon, Titania, and Puck with Fairies Dancing</em> (c. 1786).</p>
<p>To illustrate further his imaginative and metaphorical approach, 
there was a focus on his self-created mythologies, which the exhibit 
declared his “most complex and original works,” in an area dedicated to 
Blake’s prophetic books. The human body, especially the body of Urizen, 
was the centerpiece of these works, in which soft, contoured lines 
delineated tormented poses and expressed radical representations of 
terror. The viewer was prompted to glean Blake’s political tendencies in
 this section. His <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> (1793), 
where we see both men and women enslaved, chained to immovable rock, was
 presented as a commentary on sexual freedom, gender roles, and 
equality.</p>
<p>In addition to introducing Blakean themes, there was also an emphasis
 on technique. An area featured his innovative use of tempera by 
employing the technique of defining lines and contours in black ink 
after applying layers of gum-based color, highlighting Blake’s belief 
that a work of art was all the more perfect “the more distinct, sharp, 
and wirey the bounding line.” Works exemplifying the variety of 
materials used by Blake, such as canvas atop cardboard, iron, or 
pine—the latter used for <em>Winter</em> (c. 1820-25), which is nearly 
completely white—were displayed alongside the spiritual portraits of 
contemporaries William Pitt and Lord Nelson. One of Blake’s more 
delightful, imaginative works, <em>The Ghost of a Flea</em> (c. 
1819-20), was featured prominently. Crowds gathered around it, perhaps 
to read the lengthy label describing its origin as one of Blake’s 
magical visions, or perhaps to glimpse its fine detail despite its 
diminutive size.</p>
<p>In a slightly out-of-the-way area, next to a room of Blake’s unfinished series for the <em>Divine Comedy</em> (from the 1820s), images of pages from a copy of <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>
 were projected along with a digital “page turner” of his Notebook, so 
one could turn its many pages by swiping a screen. Each page included 
very detailed descriptions in both English and Spanish. The space 
underscored the interrelationship between writing and image, the realm 
in which Blake really shone, which was clear even in translation.</p>
<p>To prompt the link between Blake and artistic movements that followed, his tiny wood-block engravings for <em>The Pastorals of Virgil</em>
 (1821), featuring mainly pastoral scenes, were presented as antecedents
 to works of the group of acolytes who called themselves the Ancients, 
displayed in the same room. It was difficult to miss the nearly 
identical shepherd figures of Blake’s Thenot in the frontispiece for <em>The Pastorals of Virgil</em>
 and George Richmond’s “The Shepherd” (1827). The Ancients admired 
Blake’s visionary genius; however, theirs was a more nostalgic worldview
 akin to late romanticism and lacking the social-critical inference of 
Blake’s oeuvre.</p>
<p>In contrast, Blake and the Pre-Raphaelites shared similar visual and 
ideological interests. Visualizing mythology was one such parallel. For 
the Pre-Raphaelites, of course, this often meant the depiction of 
Arthurian myth. The more radical Pre-Raphaelites appreciated Blake’s 
visionary approach and his belief in the role of the artist as 
prophet-philosopher. Here, work by the movement’s great artist Dante 
Gabriel Rossetti—a “complete” artist like Blake—offered direct thematic 
ties to Blake with a Dante-inspired wood engraving, and also technical 
similarities of medium, the human form, and spatialization (<em>How Sir Galahad, Sir Bors, and Sir Percival Were Fed with the Sanc Grael</em>
 [1864]). Also mentioned was Rossetti’s involvement, along with 
Alexander Gilchrist, in Blake’s biography, which helped to establish 
Blake’s eminence in British art.</p>
<p>Radicalism being the link, pieces from the symbolists were shown to 
delineate again a more ideological connection with Blake. They were 
advocates of the prophetic role of the artist and viewed Blake as their 
ancestor. In the soft-colored, spiritually themed works of George 
Frederic Watts, the ink of Aubrey Beardsley, and a stark lithograph of 
Charles Shannon, among others, recurrent mythological themes and the 
prominence of lines were unmistakable.</p>
<p>Lastly, the exhibition pointed toward Blake’s legacy with examples 
from the twentieth-century neoromantic movement. Due to a lack of 
explanation, the connection to these artists was more tenuous, despite 
the display of a small-scale version of Eduardo Paolozzi’s sculpture <em>Newton</em> (1988) and the thematic parallels and dramatic reds of Cecil Collins’s <em>The Fall of Lucifer</em>
 (1933), which appeared to be a direct reworking of Blake’s work of the 
same name for the book of Job. Some of the works supplied here had 
closer connections to surrealism or expressionism than they did to 
Blake; take, for example, Collins’s <em>The Poet</em> (1941), with its 
triangular figures set in a Daliesque landscape. This was one of the 
weaknesses of the exhibit. The areas that stressed Blake’s influence on 
these movements could have been more extensive, if not more fully 
explained through direct comparisons or commentary. I found the 
connections to be vague, especially in the case of the neoromantics, 
whereas there were such rich descriptions in other areas of the 
exhibition. In addition, the digitalized image area, including Blake’s 
chronology, should have been located more prominently.</p>
<div class="illus"><img src="762.jpg" height="323" width="600"></div>
<div class="illus"><img src="763.jpg" height="419" width="600"></div>
<p>Late in the summer I corresponded with the exhibit’s coordinator, 
Eduardo Rostan Robledo, who works at the CaixaForum Barcelona; he 
reported that interest had been very high. When I visited the exhibit in
 its first week (the first of many visits) it was full of people and the
 din of whispers and admiration. In Spain, Blake has often been referred
 to as “el Goya inglés,” the English Goya, comparing him to the nation’s
 most revered painter of the romantic era. The comparison, of course, 
refers to the artists’ singular styles and sometimes subversive approach
 to their subjects. Spain already loves him. It verifies that, as the 
exhibition materials suggest, Blake’s prestige and legacy only increase 
with time. Blake, like Goya, whose paintings hang across the street at 
the Prado, deserves a prominent place in the realm of art. He endures, 
marking the canvases of later generations, much like the vermilion still
 glowing bright in his own work.</p>
