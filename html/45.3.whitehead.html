She was also a unique source for much information about his life and working practices communicated to Frederick Tatham, his fellow Ancients, and other friends and visitors. For almost forty-five years she was the person who lived and worked most closely with Blake, enabling him to realize numerous projects, impossible without her assistance. Catherine was an artist and printer in her own right, with firsthand knowledge and experience of Blake&amp;rsquo;s art practices. And yet in surviving contemporary records written during and after her marriage, she was principally commended for her domestic role.   Image &amp;copy; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. PD.158-1985.

recognition of Catherine’s position in Blake’s life and work have grown.
 In 1993 Joseph Viscomi asserted her integral role in all aspects of 
Blake’s bookmaking projects.&nbsp;<a href="#fn4" name="fr4" id="fr4">[4]</a> In 2004 she was given her own entry in the new edition of the <em>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</em>.&nbsp;<a href="#fn5" name="fr5" id="fr5">[5]</a> Eugenie R. Freed, in her review of Barbara Lachman’s fictionalized life, <em>Voices for Catherine Blake: A Gathering</em> (2000), observed:
        <blockquote>Like many of those interested in Blake’s work, I <em>do </em>feel
 the need to know a great deal more about Catherine Blake, an unsung 
heroine who has yet to be acknowledged as the courageous woman of many 
parts that she had to be in real life.&nbsp;<a href="#fn6" name="fr6" id="fr6">[6]</a></blockquote></td>

      <td class="body">As this essay will demonstrate, scholars have yet
 to exhaust all avenues in reclaiming historical information concerning 
the life of Blake’s wife. Hitherto, the final four years of her life 
(1827-31) have received negligible attention from Blake’s biographers. 
Only G. E. Bentley, Jr., has attempted a detailed chronological 
reconstruction of where Catherine lived during those years. In the 
second edition of <em>Blake Records </em>he suggests that after six 
months living and working at 6 Cirencester Place, John Linnell’s town 
house and painting studio (Sept. 1827-c. Mar. 1828), the recently 
widowed Catherine lived, briefly, alone in lodgings at 17 Upper 
Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, before residing with Tatham and his 
wife at 20 Lisson Grove North (Apr. 1828-spring 1829). According to 
Bentley, she then returned to her former residence in Upper Charlotte 
Street.&nbsp;<a href="#fn7" name="fr7" id="fr7">[7]</a></td>

    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">4</td>
      <td class="body">Bentley’s reconstruction, based on contemporary 
data and informed guesswork, provides our most reliable picture of her 
last years to date. We can be certain that she lived at Cirencester 
Place for the first six months of her widowhood.&nbsp;<a href="#fn8" name="fr8" id="fr8">[8]</a>
 However, reliable information about the remaining three and a half 
years of her life is meager. A close inspection of Bentley’s chronology 
reveals that we really know little of Catherine’s life or whereabouts 
after she left Tatham in the early spring of 1829. Moreover, the precise
 nature of Tatham’s domestic arrangements is unknown. Bentley’s 
assertion that Catherine resided with and worked for Tatham and his wife
 at Lisson Grove, although apparently widely accepted, is based on 
circumstantial evidence and has not been fully investigated. Tatham’s 
wife, the “Mrs. Tatham” in whose arms Catherine died,&nbsp;<a href="#fn9" name="fr9" id="fr9">[9]</a>
 has not been identified, nor has any Blake biographer recovered the 
precise location of the last residence of Catherine Blake. Although it 
is clear that she resided at no. 17, it has not been established whether
 her final lodgings were in Charlotte Street, Upper Charlotte Street, 
Charlton Street, or Upper Charlton Street, Fitzroy Square.</td>

concerning the life, residences, and circle of Catherine Blake in the 
period immediately following her departure from Linnell’s town house, c.
 March 1828, until her death in mid-October 1831. It revises a number of
 Bentley’s assertions regarding the chronology and location of her 
residences. The essay will also explore her relationship with Frederick 
Tatham, the member of the Ancients with whom she had most contact after 
Blake’s death, and who—rightly or wrongly—inherited the Blakes’ earthly 
possessions after Catherine’s demise.</td>

      <td class="body"><strong>1. Catherine Blake in Widowhood, 1827-31</strong>
        <p>When William Blake died on the evening of 12 August 1827, Catherine was left a considerable number of unsold works&nbsp;<a href="#fn10" name="fr10" id="fr10">[10]</a>
 but little ready money, and she appears to have been unable to support 
herself. That day she was obliged to borrow five pounds from Blake’s 
patron Linnell.&nbsp;<a href="#fn11" name="fr11" id="fr11">[11]</a> In a
 letter to Linnell written two days later, John Constable expressed the 
hope that the Royal Academy would “do something handsome for the widow” 
and gave him advice as to how to apply to the academy’s benevolent fund 
on Catherine’s behalf.&nbsp;<a href="#fn12" name="fr12" id="fr12">[12]</a>
 Nevertheless, about a week after Blake’s death Catherine appeared 
intent on continuing to print from a rolling press, presumably in an 
effort to market her husband’s works and support herself. About 18 
August James Lahee, copperplate printer of Castle Street, Oxford Market,
 wrote in response to a query from Linnell that he was willing to accept
 the Blakes’ old press: “if it happens not to be larger than Grand 
Eagle, and it is a good one in other respects I have one idle which 
would answer M<sup>rs</sup> B’s purpose.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn13" name="fr13" id="fr13">[13]</a>
 However, the proposed project to swap presses appears not to have 
materialized, as four days later Linnell arranged for Blake’s star wheel
 rolling press to be moved from 3 Fountain Court to Cirencester 
Place.&nbsp;<a href="#fn14" name="fr14" id="fr14">[14]</a> Catherine followed two weeks after the press.</p></td>

      <td class="paranumber">7</td>
      <td class="body">During the period in which she lived with Linnell
 and then with Tatham, Catherine’s principal means of support derived 
from her performance of the duties of a domestic housekeeper. While at 
Cirencester Place she was also responsible for accepting money from 
Linnell’s customers when he was not at home.&nbsp;<a href="#fn15" name="fr15" id="fr15">[15]</a>
 Nevertheless, from the autumn of 1827 she began occasionally to sell 
her late husband’s works to visitors. With Linnell’s assistance, she 
sold Blake’s last commission, a name plate, as well as a copy of <em>Illustrations of the Book of</em> <em>Job</em>, to his old friend George Cumberland.&nbsp;<a href="#fn16" name="fr16" id="fr16">[16]</a> Catherine also attempted to encourage Cumberland to try to sell further copies of <em>Job</em> in Bristol, despite the fact that he had been unable to sell the copy he had received from Blake some months earlier.&nbsp;<a href="#fn17" name="fr17" id="fr17">[17]</a></td>

      <td class="body">Although on 8 December Linnell loaned Catherine a further five pounds,&nbsp;<a href="#fn18" name="fr18" id="fr18">[18]</a>
 a month later she was clearly beginning to establish a customer base 
for her husband’s works. On 8 January 1828 she sold three copies of 
“Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims” to the judge and writer Barron Field and 
Blake’s acquaintance Henry Crabb Robinson (one of the copies was for 
Charles Lamb). On this occasion, Catherine agreed to look out other 
engravings.&nbsp;<a href="#fn19" name="fr19" id="fr19">[19]</a> On 17 March Mrs. Samuel Smith and Miss Julia Smith called on Catherine and paid eight guineas for <em>Lear and Cordelia in Prison</em> (1779) and <em>A Female Figure Crouching in a Cave</em>.&nbsp;<a href="#fn20" name="fr20" id="fr20">[20]</a> Alexander Gilchrist describes Catherine’s marketing skills as well as her finishing of Blake’s works during this period:
        <blockquote>She was an excellent saleswoman, and never committed
 the mistake of showing too many things at one time. Aided by Mr. Tatham
 she also filled in, within Blake’s lines, the colour of the Engraved 
Books; and even finished some of the drawings—rather against Mr. 
Linnell’s judgment.&nbsp;<a href="#fn21" name="fr21" id="fr21">[21]</a></blockquote></td>

featured a biography, appear to have enhanced Catherine’s chances of 
selling works. Smith wrote that “[Blake’s] beloved Kate survives him 
clear of even a sixpenny debt; and in the fullest belief that the 
remainder of her days will be rendered tolerable by the sale of the few 
copies of her husband’s works, which she will dispose of at the original
 price of publication.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn22" name="fr22" id="fr22">[22]</a> In early November he wrote to Linnell, “What I have said of your worthy friend Blake I am fully aware has been servisable [<em>sic</em>] to his widow.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn23" name="fr23" id="fr23">[23]</a> Later that month the barrister, antiquary, and art collector William Twopenny contacted Smith:

        Catherine’s business acumen, as well as her belief in vision and
 her husband’s continued presence, is perhaps apparent in her informing 
Linnell on 27 January 1829 that “M<sup>r</sup> Blake told her he thought I sh<sup>d</sup>. pay 3gs. a piece for the Plates of Dante—.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn25" name="fr25" id="fr25">[25]</a></td>

residence in Grosvenor Place.&nbsp;<a href="#fn29" name="fr29" id="fr29">[29]</a> The sale provided further financial security. In early 1830 Allan Cunningham’s life of Blake appeared in volume 2 of his <em>Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</em>,

Blake’s name, as well as Catherine’s, reached an even wider

which she did most carefully, and ever delighted in the task.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn33" name="fr33" id="fr33">[33]</a>

      <td class="body"><strong>2. Catherine Blake’s Residence with Frederick Tatham, c. March 1828-April 1829</strong>
        <p>On Linnell’s departure during the spring of 1828 from 
Cirencester Place to his new family home and studio at 26 Porchester 
Terrace, Bayswater, Catherine moved to the residence of her friend 
Tatham.&nbsp;<a href="#fn42" name="fr42" id="fr42">[42]</a> In his “Life of Blake,” completed c. 1832, Tatham wrote:
        </p><blockquote>After the death of her husband she resided for 
some time with the Author of this[,] whose domestic arrangements were 
entirely undertaken by her; until such changes took place that rendered 
it impossible for her strength to continue in this voluntary office of 
sincere affection &amp; regard.&nbsp;<a href="#fn43" name="fr43" id="fr43">[43]</a></blockquote>
        However, her working and domestic relationship with Tatham 
probably differed from that which she had experienced with Linnell. 
While using Cirencester Place as a studio during the week, Linnell spent
 the majority of his free time, weekends, and evenings with his wife and
 young family at their farm cottage at North End, Hampstead.&nbsp;<a href="#fn44" name="fr44" id="fr44">[44]</a>
 During these periods Catherine Blake was a house sitter, relaying 
messages concerning customers and other callers to Linnell via nephews 
in his employment.&nbsp;<a href="#fn45" name="fr45" id="fr45">[45]</a> 
She may have been similarly employed at Tatham’s. However, whereas 
Linnell appears to have paid her twenty pounds for her six-month 
employment at Cirencester Place,&nbsp;<a href="#fn46" name="fr46" id="fr46">[46]</a> Tatham describes her role as a “voluntary office.”</td>

      <td class="paranumber">16</td>

with Tatham than with Linnell. While he does not mention remunerating 
Catherine, he probably treated her in her “voluntary office” as a friend
 or guest rather than as a servant or dependent. He uses the phrase 
“maternal loveliness” to describe the nature of her role.&nbsp;<a href="#fn47" name="fr47" id="fr47">[47]</a>
 Catherine was in her sixties and childless with only two surviving 
relatives, while Tatham was approximately twenty-three. A quarter of a 
century earlier, a former fellow resident and wife of the Blakes’ first 
landlord at South Molton Street, “the young &amp; very amiable M<sup>rs</sup> Enoch. … gave [Catherine] all the attention that a daughter could pay to a mother.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn48" name="fr48" id="fr48">[48]</a> Tatham may have found himself filling a similar role as surrogate son.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">17</td>
      <td class="body">Catherine may have had another reason for her 
“maternal loveliness.” During this period Tatham appears to have 
suffered from a debilitating mental and physical illness, causing his 
family and friends considerable concern. In a letter to George Richmond 
dated 12 May 1827, Samuel Palmer wrote “Pray Sir bring a very particular
 account of Mr Tatham’s health.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn49" name="fr49" id="fr49">[49]</a> Tatham was still ill three months later when he traveled ninety miles to attend Blake’s funeral on 17 August.&nbsp;<a href="#fn50" name="fr50" id="fr50">[50]</a> In October 1828 Palmer wrote to Richmond, “I am rejoiced to hear that Mr Tatham is much better.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn51" name="fr51" id="fr51">[51]</a>
 A letter to Linnell from Tatham’s father, the architect Charles 
Heathcote Tatham, in early 1828 seems to suggest that Frederick was 
suffering from a long-term and recurrent illness:
        <blockquote>I hear you still consult that Top-sawyer [eminent 
personage] Thornton. He has been a thorn in my side; but I endeavour to 
forget his unsuccessful and expensive experiments upon my poor 
son.&nbsp;<a href="#fn52" name="fr52" id="fr52">[52]</a></blockquote>

time performing the duties of a sick nurse and carer, as she had for her
 husband less than a year earlier.</td>

      <td class="paranumber">18</td>
      <td class="body">Catherine’s “voluntary” service for Tatham may 
have derived in part from affection for a young man who, despite 
personal inconvenience both in distance and health, had attended Blake’s
 funeral and shown care and concern for her in the first six months of 
her widowhood. Tatham and his wife would later nurse and attend 
Catherine at her deathbed, and she died in Tatham’s wife’s arms. The 
couple organized, attended, and almost certainly paid for her funeral, 
which she requested should follow the form of her husband’s four years 
earlier.&nbsp;<a href="#fn53" name="fr53" id="fr53">[53]</a> Linnell, by
 contrast, appears not to have been present at either funeral, possibly 
because both were conducted according to the Church of England’s service
 for the burial of the dead. As a strong-minded dissenter who had 
traveled to Scotland in order to avoid a Church of England marriage 
ceremony, he appears to have preferred to offer Catherine financial 
assistance.&nbsp;<a href="#fn54" name="fr54" id="fr54">[54]</a></td>

stay. He simply states that she lived with him “for some time.” Until 
1969, no Blake biographer had discussed either the location or the 
duration. In the first edition of <em>Blake Records</em>, however, 
Bentley asserted that from 1828 until 1831 Catherine resided with Tatham
 and his wife at 20 Lisson Grove North, northwest London.&nbsp;<a href="#fn55" name="fr55" id="fr55">[55]</a>
 During the running dispute with Linnell concerning ownership of the 
Dante watercolors and plates, Tatham corresponded from this address on 
15 March 1831 and again, twice, on 1 March 1833.&nbsp;<a href="#fn56" name="fr56" id="fr56">[56]</a> Lisson Grove North is also the address he gives at the end of his “Life of Blake,” written c. 1832.&nbsp;<a href="#fn57" name="fr57" id="fr57">[57]</a>
 This, therefore, was certainly his residence during the period 1831-33.
 Bentley appears to have concluded that Tatham had resided there with 
Catherine three years earlier. However, an examination of the Marylebone
 poor rate book entries reveals that neither Frederick Tatham, Mrs. 
Tatham, nor Catherine Blake lived at this address in spring 1828.</td>

to stay with the entire family at this address. She could have acted as 
housekeeper and helped look after C. H. and Harriet Tatham’s younger

 However, this seems unlikely. In his “Life of Blake” Tatham recalled 
that his “domestic arrangements were entirely undertaken” by Catherine. 
Gilchrist, who interviewed Tatham about 1860, refers to his residence as
 “chambers,”&nbsp;<a href="#fn68" name="fr68" id="fr68">[68]</a> a 
description which suggests a professional working environment, probably 
for a bachelor. Tatham is perhaps recollecting a period in which he

 siblings at Alpha Road at weekends and on occasion overnight during the
 week. If this was the case, Catherine Blake may have spent only a

Blake’s letter to Linnell of 15 March 1827, C. H. Tatham visited 3 
Fountain Court the previous day. Blake writes:
        <blockquote>I saw M<sup>r</sup> Tatham Sen<sup>r</sup> yesterday
 he sat with me above an hour &amp; lookd over the Dante he expressd 
himself very much pleasd with the designs as well as the 
Engravings.&nbsp;<a href="#fn83" name="fr83" id="fr83">[83]</a></blockquote>
        Catherine could therefore have given him the engraving during 
this visit. As Bentley (more recently) and Essick have observed, 
however, the fact that the note is signed by Catherine suggests that the
 engraving was presented during the period of her widowhood.&nbsp;<a href="#fn84" name="fr84" id="fr84">[84]</a></td>

        <p>Bentley states in the first edition of <em>Blake Records</em> that “Catherine Blake lived as housekeeper to Frederick Tatham and his wife.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn87" name="fr87" id="fr87">[87]</a> In the final section of his “Life of Blake,” Tatham mentions his wife’s relationship with Catherine:
        </p><blockquote>[Catherine] was followed to her grave by 2 whom 
she dearly loved, nay almost idolized, whose welfare was interwoven with
 the chords of her life &amp; whose well being was her only solace, her 
only motive for exertion &amp; her only joy. The news of any success to 
them was a ray of Sun in the dark twilight of her life. Their cares were
 hers, their sorrows were her own. To them she was as the fondest 
mother, as the most affectionate Sister &amp; as the best of friends[;] 
these had the satisfaction of putting into her trembling hands the last 
cup of moisture she applied to her dying lips &amp; to them she 
bequeathed her all.&nbsp;<a href="#fn88" name="fr88" id="fr88">[88]</a></blockquote>
        He refers to his wife more explicitly in a letter to Linnell sent on the day of Catherine’s death, 18 October 1831: “M<sup>rs</sup>
 Tatham &amp; myself have been with her during her suffering &amp; have 
had the happiness of beholding the departure of a saint for the rest 
promised to those who die in the Lord.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn89" name="fr89" id="fr89">[89]</a> Gilchrist states that Catherine “died in Mrs. Tatham’s arms.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn90" name="fr90" id="fr90">[90]</a>
 These accounts establish the Tathams’ presence as regular visitors at 
her last residence, overnight attendants at her deathbed, and two of the
 six friends who attended her burial at Bunhill Fields on 23 October.

        <p>As has been established, Tatham wrote a letter from Alpha 
Road in April 1829 providing his correspondent with Catherine’s new 
address, so she must have left by spring 1829 and possibly several 
months earlier. By c. February 1829 she had sufficient funds and 
furnishings to support a move to her own lodgings. According to the will
 of her brother-in-law and former landlord, Henry Banes, proved on 14 
February, she was to receive “half my household goods consisting of 
Bedsteads Beds &amp; pillows Bolsters &amp; sheets &amp; pillow Cases 
Tables Chairs &amp; crockery &amp; £20 in lawful money of Great 
Britain.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn94" name="fr94" id="fr94">[94]</a> Banes, who
 died on 20 January 1829, may have informed the Blakes of his intention 
to leave them a portion of his money and goods when he wrote a new will 
on 9 December 1826.&nbsp;<a href="#fn95" name="fr95" id="fr95">[95]</a> 
At that time, the Blakes were lodgers in his house at 3 Fountain Court, 
Strand. Two years later, this bequest would have enabled, and may even 
have prompted, Catherine’s move. It contributed to what Bentley has 
described as her “new-found financial security.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn96" name="fr96" id="fr96">[96]</a>
 Moreover, in letters of August 1829 to George O’Brien Wyndham, third 
Earl of Egremont, she gave advice on the application of a third coat of 
varnish to the design from Spenser’s<em> Faerie Queene</em>, which he 
had purchased in July for eighty-four pounds. As Bentley has observed, 
this generous payment would have “kept Catherine out of want for the 
rest of her life.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn97" name="fr97" id="fr97">[97]</a> 
Significantly, in January 1830 she requested that an application to the

moved to her own lodgings near Fitzroy Square, her final earthly 
residence, by the spring of 1829. However, the length of time that she 
spent there means that the dating of some events must be less precise 
than has previously been suggested. One such incident is Tatham’s 
difference of opinion with her which culminated in his burning Blake’s 
“will” at her lodgings.&nbsp;<a href="#fn99" name="fr99" id="fr99">[99]</a> Bentley, following his chronology of her last residences in the first edition of <em>Blake Records</em>, claims that “the incident took place in 1831.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn100" name="fr100" id="fr100">[100]</a>
 However, the revised dating suggests that the disagreement could have 
occurred at any time between early spring 1829 and October 1831.&nbsp;<a href="#fn101" name="fr101" id="fr101">[101]</a></td>

chronology of Catherine’s residences remains. Tatham claims that, after 
leaving his residence, “[Catherine] then returned to the lodging in 
which she had lived previously to this act of maternal loveliness [i.e.,
 acting as housekeeper to Tatham].” However, he mentions no place in 
which she lived after Blake’s death other than his own: “After the death
 of her husband she resided for some time with the Author of 
this.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn102" name="fr102" id="fr102">[102]</a> Tatham 
does not refer to either Linnell or his town house and studio at 6 
Cirencester Place, Fitzroy Square, where Catherine lived until spring 
1828.&nbsp;<a href="#fn103" name="fr103" id="fr103">[103]</a> Bentley 
appears to interpret his statement as suggesting that Catherine lived in
 the same flat both before and after her stay with Tatham.&nbsp;<a href="#fn104" name="fr104" id="fr104">[104]</a>
 It is unlikely, however, that she would or could have returned to 
exactly the same lodgings. More significantly, the sequence of 
residences that I have outlined above makes it improbable that Catherine
 could have spent any period of time living independently between 
leaving Cirencester Place and moving to Queen Street. Rather, Tatham’s 
confusing and inaccurate statement suggests an attempt to skate over 
uncomfortable facts.&nbsp;<a href="#fn105" name="fr105" id="fr105">[105]</a>
 At the time that he wrote his manuscript biography of Blake (c. 1832), 
he and Linnell were no longer on speaking terms. Their alienation was 
due firstly to a difference of opinion concerning ownership of Blake’s 
Dante watercolors and plates that surfaced in the first half of March 
1831. Secondly, Tatham’s claiming the Blakes’ entire estate on 
Catherine’s death in October 1831 appears to have annoyed Linnell, who 
supported the claim of Blake’s sister.&nbsp;<a href="#fn106" name="fr106" id="fr106">[106]</a>
 Tatham may not have wished to revive recent memories of distasteful 
arguments or draw attention to his conduct in dealings with Catherine 
and Linnell.</td>

      <td class="body">We must also consider the significance of a 
meeting between Linnell and Tatham recorded in Linnell’s journal for 29 
March 1828: “Mr F. Tatham dined at Hampstead.” David Linnell interprets 
this as evidence that
        <blockquote>[Linnell] asked Frederick Tatham to dine with him to
 discuss where Mrs Blake should live once he had let Cirencester Place. 
Frederick Tatham suggested that Mrs Blake should move into his house and
 this was then arranged.&nbsp;<a href="#fn107" name="fr107" id="fr107">[107]</a></blockquote>
        The date of the entry gives some plausibility to David Linnell’s
 reading. As has been established, Catherine probably lodged with Tatham
 for a year or less. If she resided in her own lodgings between leaving

potential customers in the neighborhood whom she had met while living 
under Linnell’s roof. The sculptor and book illustrator Maria Denman and

error in locating the residence. Although, as one would expect, Upper

The new landlord, George Miller, may therefore have advertised for

Henry Banes and began searching for new lodgings in anticipation of 
Tatham’s move to Lisson Grove North. It could also be argued that a 
change in landlord throws additional doubt upon Bentley’s suggestion 
that Catherine occupied the same lodgings both before and after residing

upper floor.&nbsp;<a href="#fn133" name="fr133" id="fr133">[133]</a> 
Linnell spent one of his formative years learning his craft from a

Blake. The connection with Linnell may even suggest that Blake’s patron

      <td class="body">The fact that Mulready had previously occupied 17
 Upper Charlton Street for a year over two decades earlier may seem of 
little importance. However, his use of a room in this house as a 
painting studio suggests that Catherine could have printed, colored, and
 sold Blake’s work there. Although Gilchrist describes the lodgings as 
“humble,” the rateable value of the property was sixty pounds, the 
highest in the street&nbsp;<a href="#fn134" name="fr134" id="fr134">[134]</a>
 and considerably more than twice the value of the Blakes’ final 
residence together at 3 Fountain Court. I have been unable to find a 
floor plan or front elevation of no. 17, but an Ordnance Survey map of 
the area, published in 1872, reveals the footprint of the building (<a href="45.3.whiteheadosmap" target="_blank">illus. 4</a>).
 In addition, a sketch of the front elevation of one of the terrace 
houses on the east side of Upper Charlton Street has been located at the
 City of Westminster Archives Centre (<a href="45.3.whiteheadhouse" target="_blank">illus. 5</a>).
 From this evidence we may deduce that no. 17 was a Georgian terrace 
with two rooms on each floor, a large front one and smaller back one. 
Catherine may have organized her space, almost certainly an upper-floor 
apartment,&nbsp;<a href="#fn135" name="fr135" id="fr135">[135]</a> along the lines of her and her husband’s rooms at 17 South Molton Street and 3 Fountain Court.&nbsp;<a href="#fn136" name="fr136" id="fr136">[136]</a>
 She may have received visitors in the smaller living room at the back 
of the house; a larger front room may have been used to store her stock 
of Blake’s paintings, engravings, and drawings. It is likely that she 
would also have had room for the furniture inherited from her 
brother-in-law. Whether or not she moved into the rooms that Mulready 
had utilized, the orientation and light would have been the same. As 
Mulready probably chose the residence as suitable for a painting studio,
 in her front room Catherine almost certainly had adequate light and 
space to set up her own studio for coloring works and perhaps even for 
printing on a rolling press.&nbsp;<a href="#fn137" name="fr137" id="fr137">[137]</a>
 In the front room, with Tatham’s assistance, she may have printed 
posthumous copies of Blake’s illuminated books. The scaled 
representation of the footprint of no. 17 on the 1872 survey map reveals
 that the front rooms on the upper floors measured approximately 5.49 
meters (18 feet) in width and 3.66 meters (12 feet) in depth. This means
 that for over two years, Catherine, living independently, had space to 
color and sell her late husband’s works and could also resume her role 
in printing copies of his illuminated books.&nbsp;<a href="#fn138" name="fr138" id="fr138">[138]</a><div class="illus"><img src="370.jpg" alt="Upper Charlton Street in a detail of the Ordnance Survey map, 1872" height="193" width="200"><div>4.

        <p>The material presented in this paper gives us cause to revise
 the chronology of the residences and microcultures that Catherine Blake
 lived in from 1828 to 1831 (see table below). It has demonstrated that 
she did not spend the majority of her final years as housekeeper to 
Frederick Tatham and his wife at their house in Lisson Grove North. 
Evidence suggests that she resided as housekeeper with Frederick, a 
bachelor, in chambers above her old friend C. H. Tatham’s practice as an
 architect at 1 Queen Street, Mayfair, from March 1828 until the early 
spring of 1829. Catherine’s close young female friend, the wife of 
Frederick, has been identified as Louisa Keen Viney Tatham. Evidence has
 also been provided to support the argument that Catherine had the means
 to and almost certainly did move to her own lodgings in or shortly 
before the spring of 1829. Finally, the precise location of her “humble 
lodgings,” 17 Upper Charlton Street, Fitzroy Square, has been 
established. The residence and the duration of her stay provided her 
with the opportunity to sell Blake’s works, finish and color others, and
 perhaps print posthumous copies of the illuminated books, and thereby 
live independently for the last two and a half years of her life.

      <td class="body">In the light of these findings, we can also 
revise our view of Catherine. She was not a dependent Blake relict, 
reliant upon his old friends and passed from Ancient to Ancient. Upon 
inheriting Banes’s bequest, she embarked at the age of sixty-seven on a 
period of independence, possibly for the first time in her life. On an 
upper floor at 17 Upper Charlton Street, she appears to have continued 
her husband’s trade, printing, coloring, and selling works up until her 
death, over a year into the reign of William IV. In this constant labor 
in old age, she perhaps followed her husband’s maxim of working through 
illness.&nbsp;<a href="#fn139" name="fr139" id="fr139">[139]</a> Such unremitting industry may account for her having neglected a bowel complaint that led to her death.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">48</td>
      <td class="body">This emerging picture seems consistent with 
Essick’s suggestion that during Blake’s lifetime Catherine was “the more
 practical of the two,”&nbsp;<a href="#fn140" name="fr140" id="fr140">[140]</a>
 and Mark Crosby and Essick’s discussion of Blake’s tribute to her in 
response to William Hayley’s “Klopstockian” compliment.&nbsp;<a href="#fn141" name="fr141" id="fr141">[141]</a>
 Contemporary and early accounts portray Catherine as on occasion 
unstable, difficult, miserable, and ill. Blake’s own reported behavior 
may lead us to suspect that their working and emotional partnership 
cannot have been uniformly efficient or idyllic. Nevertheless, Catherine
 must also have exhibited during her marriage to Blake the resilience 
and financial acumen evident in her later widowhood—to the couple’s 
advantage.</td>

as a Servant” (G. E. Bentley, Jr., <em>Blake Records</em>, 2nd ed. [New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004] [hereafter <em>BR</em>(2)] 294). She had probably been in service as a maidservant before marrying (see <em>BR</em>[2]
 71). There is an account of there being a servant at the Blakes’ house 
in the early period of their residence at 13 Hercules Buildings, 
Lambeth, in the 1790s. However, according to Tatham, Catherine soon took
 over those duties: “(as M<sup>rs</sup>. Blake declared …) the more service the more Inconvenience” (“Life of Blake,” quoted in <em>BR</em>[2] 676).</p>

In a note to the artist and traveler Edward Thomas Daniell written shortly after 11 Sept. 1827, Linnell states, “M<sup>rs</sup> Blake … lives with me now here [i.e., Cirencester Place].” George Cumberland addressed his letter dated 25 Nov. to “M<sup>rs</sup>. Blake at M<sup>r</sup> Linells 6 Cirencester Place” (<em>BR</em>[2] 477fn). However, Linnell spent most of his time at Hampstead with his family (see <em>BR</em>[2] 475). No record of Catherine’s having been invited to help Mrs. Linnell with the children at Hampstead has been traced.</p>
        <p><a href="#fr16" name="fn16" id="fn16">16</a>. In Nov. George 
Cumberland, Jr., called on Catherine at Cirencester Place; Linnell is 
not recorded as present. It appears that Catherine was responsible for 
persuading George Cumberland to buy the name plate and a copy of <em>Job</em> (see <em>BR</em>[2]
 475, 479). After paying £5.15.6 for these works on 16 Jan. 1828, George
 Jr. reported to his father in Bristol that “[Catherine’s] late husbands
 works she intends to prin[t] with her own hands and trust to their 
sal[e] for a livelihood” (<em>BR</em>[2] 482).</p>
        <p><a href="#fr17" name="fn17" id="fn17">17</a>. In his letter to Catherine of 25 Nov., Cumberland explained that he could not sell the copy of <em>Job </em>in his possession. He also suggested a way of marketing the remainder of Blake’s works:
        </p><blockquote style="text-indent: .104in">That elaborate work,
 I have not only shewn to all our amateurs and artists here without 
success but am now pushing it through Clifton, by means of Mr Lane the

 and another of our Print Sellers here without success—and as that is 
the case, and that even those who desired me to write to my friend for a
 List of his works and prices, (among whom were his great admirers from 
having seen what I possessed …) declined giving him any orders, on 
account, as they said, of the prices—I should not recommend you to send 
any more here—but rather to fix a place in London where all his works 
may be disposed of offering a complete set for Sale to the BMPR, as that
 will make them best known.—better even than their independant author

However, Catherine’s manner of conducting business may sometimes have 
inhibited sales. Discussing his disagreement with Catherine and Tatham 
over the ownership of the Dante drawings and plates, Linnell observed on
 16 Mar. 1831, “I c<sup>d</sup>. never obtain any definite account of what she expected or wished me to do” (<em>BR</em>[2] 541). She also appears to have exasperated Tatham (see <em>BR</em>[2] 493-94).</p>

 point, Bentley wrote, “The Frederick Tatham letter is clearly dated, in
 the MS copy (of which I have a reproduction), the only evidence of it,

          According to Gilchrist (1: 366), Ferguson “took copies of three or four of the Engraved Books,” probably <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em>, <em>America</em>, and <em>Europe</em> (see <em>BR</em>[2] 481fn).</p>

 503-08. Catherine is compared in one review to the German poet 
Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock’s wife, Margareta (Meeta) Möller. On 27 
Apr. 1830, after reading Cunningham’s life, the poet Caroline Bowles 
wrote to Robert Southey, “I hope she is not in indigence” (<em>BR</em>[2]
 530). In early Mar. 1830 Linnell conducted Haviland Burke to 
Catherine’s residence to examine and purchase works for the Bishop of 
Limerick (<em>BR</em>[2] 509). Burke paid twenty guineas for “two Drawings” (the untraced <em>Christ Showing the Print of Nails to the Disciples</em> and <em>The Body of Abel Found by Adam and Eve</em> [Butlin #666], possibly a replica by Linnell of Blake’s painting of this name), prints of “Job” and “Ezekiel,” and a copy of <em>Songs</em>.</p>
        <p><a href="#fr31" name="fn31" id="fn31">31</a>. Gilchrist 1: 367. The copy of <em>For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise </em>that Tatham gave Mr. Bird on the day of her funeral, 23 Oct. 1831, was probably from this collection (<em>BR</em>[2]
 547). In his “Life of Blake” Tatham mentions that at her death 
Catherine had “writings, paintings, &amp; a very great number of Copper 
Plates” (<em>BR</em>[2] 688).</p>

produced drawings.” According to Viscomi, “the significance of Blake 
printing his own plates and working with his wife cannot be 
overestimated” (<em>Idea of the Book</em> 105). If Catherine acted as Blake’s “printer’s devil,” as Viscomi suggests (<em>Idea of the Book</em> 117), or “clean hands,” as Essick describes her role (“Blake, Catherine Sophia,” <em>ODNB</em>),
 she would have been well versed in printing as well as coloring, but 
may have had less experience in carefully inking relief-etched 
copperplates. For the difficulties involved, see Michael Phillips, “The 
Printing of Blake’s <em>America a Prophecy</em>,” <em>Print Quarterly </em>21.1 (2004): 18-38. On Catherine as printmaker, see Viscomi,<em> Idea of the</em> <em>Book</em> 393n4.</p>

Posthumous copies of plates of <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>, poorly printed in light-blue ink, were<em> </em>on
 display at the Tate exhibition of Blake’s works at the Graves Art 
Gallery, Sheffield, May-Oct. 2003.

 engravings may also have been colored by Catherine, c. 1797. “They 
clearly were not colored after a model, they vary in color placement in 
ways similar to the illuminated books colored up (according to Viscomi) 
in the same session, the palette slips and slides in tone but seems to 
be a matter of continuous color shifts rather than distinctly different 
palettes, the quality of the coloring varies greatly in the second half 
of many copies (she got tired?), and the colors are odd—the sort of 
things one sees in enamel decorations on British soft-paste porcelain of
 the eighteenth-century rather than colored prints in books (e.g., the 
Stedman, like the <em>Night Thoughts</em> published by a member of the 
Edwards family)” (e-mail, 7 Nov. 2005). It is possible that some of 
these copies could have been colored by Catherine after Blake’s death.</p>

        <p><a href="#fr42" name="fn42" id="fn42">42</a>. At the same 
time, Linnell’s family moved from Collins’s Farm, Hampstead, to 
Porchester Terrace. Linnell was evidently in a poor state of health 
during this period due to overwork. This may have been another reason 
for Catherine’s move.</p>
        <p><a href="#fr43" name="fn43" id="fn43">43</a>. Quoted in <em>BR</em>(2)
 690. It is unclear what Tatham is referring to by “such changes.” 
However, he is probably not alluding here to Catherine’s becoming 
“decayed” (a word he uses to describe her later in the “Life,” referred 
to by G. E. Bentley, Jr., <em>Blake Records</em> [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969] [hereafter <em>BR</em>] 567). Catherine’s letter to Lord Egremont suggests that she had personally delivered <em>The Characters of Spenser’s “Faerie Queene”</em> to Grosvenor Place several months after moving to her lodgings (see <em>BR</em>[2]
 498). Grosvenor Place is some considerable distance southwest of 
Fitzroy Square. Whether she walked or took a carriage with the large 
panel on which Blake’s watercolor was mounted (Butlin #811 gives the 
dimensions as 18 x 53½ inches), such an errand is likely to have been 
beyond the capabilities of a frail woman.</p>

        <p><a href="#fr46" name="fn46" id="fn46">46</a>. It appears that
 Linnell never actually paid Catherine for her housekeeping. In a letter
 to Tatham discussing their disagreement over the Dante watercolors and 
plates, he stipulates that before giving up the drawings he expects to 
be remunerated for the money he gave the Blakes but deducts twenty 
pounds for Mrs. Blake’s “taking Care of House &amp;c in Cirencester 
Place” (<em>BR</em>[2] 539). However, as he never gave them up, it appears that Catherine never received the benefit of the “discount.”</p>

 “Tatham, ill as he was, travelled ninety miles to attend the funeral of
 one for whom, next to his own family, he held the highest esteem” 
(quoted in <em>BR</em>[2] 626). He may have traveled from Shoreham. 
Richmond recalled a visit to Shoreham on 28 June 1827: “I asked my 
father’s permission to let me join my dear friends Samuel Palmer and 
Harry Waters and (I think) Fredk. Tatham, who were then in humble 
fashion lodging in the pretty village” (see A. M. W. Stirling, ed., <em>The

me. I wish I could get him abroad; but my hands are tied and bound—my

bear a note from Mrs. Blake; it is more probable that the impression was
 a gift from Mrs. Blake sometime between Blake’s death on 12 August 1827

“bust of George Richmond is in the National Portrait Gallery, and he 
exhibited a ‘colossal bust’ of Frederick Tatham at the Society of

included a cabinetmaker, painter, pianoforte maker, leather gilder, 
chairmaker, stonemason, furniture maker, and five tailors.</p>
        <p><a href="#fr131" name="fn131" id="fn131">131</a>. Linnell, 
“Autobiography,” f. 33. Elsewhere he writes, “indeed I feel bound to say
 that I owe more to [Mulready] than anyone I ever knew” (f. 9). In the 
“Autobiography” there are far more references to Mulready than to Blake 
or Varley. It is clear that, at the time of writing, Linnell regarded 
Mulready as the greatest influence.</p>
        <p><a href="#fr132" name="fn132" id="fn132">132</a>. Linnell, “Autobiography,” ff. 31, 33.</p>
        <p><a href="#fr133" name="fn133" id="fn133">133</a>. Graves 5: 323.</p>
        <p><a href="#fr134" name="fn134" id="fn134">134</a>. Rate book entry for 17 Upper Charlton Street, Fitzroy Square, 1830 (COWAC).</p>
        <p><a href="#fr135" name="fn135" id="fn135">135</a>. It is 
unclear whether she lived above the baker’s establishment or at the back
 of the shop. In 1832 Ann and Edward Maddle, ratepayers at 14 Upper 
Charlton Street, had a female lodger, Elizabeth Tuckwell, staying in 
their back kitchen (see <em>The Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 1674-1913</em>, &lt;﻿<a href="http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/" target="_blank">http://www.oldbaileyonline.org</a>﻿&gt;, t18320906-361). However, in Catherine’s case this seems unlikely.</p>
        <p><a href="#fr136" name="fn136" id="fn136">136</a>. See 
Whitehead, “William Blake’s Last Residence: No. 3 Fountain Court, 
Strand. George Richmond’s Plan and an Unrecorded Letter to John 
Linnell,” <em>British Art Journal</em> 6.1 (2005): 21-30, and “‘I write in South Molton Street, what I both <em>see</em> and <em>hear</em>’: Reconstructing William and Catherine Blake’s Residence and Studio at 17 South Molton Street, Oxford Street,” <em>British Art Journal</em> 11.2 (2010): 62-75.</p>
        <p><a href="#fr137" name="fn137" id="fn137">137</a>. Whether by early 1829 Catherine still possessed her husband’s press, had replaced it with a smaller one (see <em>BR</em>[2] 467-68), or had no press, has yet to be established conclusively.</p>
        <p><a href="#fr138" name="fn138" id="fn138">138</a>. Perhaps her great-nephews Richard and Thomas Best assisted her (see Whitehead, ‘“<em>I also beg Mr Blakes acceptance</em>’”
 91n85). Catherine would probably not have had continuous access to the 
space needed to operate a rolling press at her two former homes. 
However, during her years at 17 Upper Charlton Street, the front room 
would have provided a permanent location for printing sessions.</p>
