        <p>This review records sales of original works by Blake and his circle during 1982 and 1983,
          with a few late 1981 entries. As in previous surveys (the last appeared in 
            <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 16 [fall 1982], 86-106), I have tried to include all sales, or attempts at
          public sale, of Blake’s drawings, paintings, manuscripts, and illuminated books. The
          listings of other materials, including works by Blake’s circle and followers, are very
          probably less thorough because I have not sought out catalogues issued by minor
          bookdealers and auction houses. All sales by Sotheby’s and Christie’s in London and New
          York are covered.</p>
        <p>For Blakeans, the 1980 auction season was highlighted by the reappearance, after a hiatus
          of 150 years, of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> copy BB. Nothing
          of equal importance emerged in the 1982 and 1983 seasons; indeed, only one impression of a
          plate from an illuminated book actually changed hands, and that was a posthumous pull of
          little significance. The most important sales were of drawings and prints: the acquisition
          of the preliminary sketch for “Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims” (illus. 2-3) by the
          Department of Prints and Drawings of the British Museum; Justin Schiller’s purchase of a
          previously unrecorded copy of <hi rend="i">Little Tom the Sailor</hi> with hand coloring
          possibly by Blake or his wife (see Hayley under “Books with Engravings by and after
          Blake”); and the sale of the Bateson version of “Satan Exulting over Eve” (illus. 6) to a
          London art dealer. The last, arguably the finest work by Blake as a pictorial artist to
          appear on the market in many years, is finer than any work likely to be offered for sale
          in the future, barring a “deaccession” by a major institution. Justice would require the
          acquisition of “Satan Exulting” by the Tate Gallery to complete its collection of Blake’s
          great color printed drawings. But cost seems to have dictated a different destiny, for I
          have just learned (April 1984) that “Satan Exulting” has joined the treasures of the J.
          Paul Getty Art Museum. The exact price has not been revealed, but I suspect it set a
          record for <hi rend="i">any</hi> work by Blake.</p>
        <p>The most intriguing discovery made in the marketplace is surely the “Felpham Rummer” (see
          under “Separate Plates” and illus. 8-12). Is this an important document about Blake’s
          years with Hayley and a wonderfully direct and moving revelation of Blake’s state of mind,
          or are we in the thrall of a clever forger, a T. J. Wise of glass engraving? The case is
          still open.</p>
        <p>Prices for works less exalted than “Satan Exulting” and less bizarre than the rummer
          remained relatively stable, with no new trends developing. Early drawings continue to be
          ignored by all but a handful of enthusiasts unless, like “A Girl Holding a Goblet” (illus.
          5), the auctioneer can associate the work with a more collectible contemporary such as
          Wedgwood. A new record was set for the auction price of “Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims” (a
          well-printed but stained impression of the third state from Lord Cunliffe’s collection),
          but no other major separate plates appeared on the market. Most prices for books with
          Blake’s commercial prints increased at a rate near the average for late eighteenth- and
          early nineteenth-century books. Only the Young/Blake <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> has
          risen noticeably in the last few years, although it remains surprisingly common for a book
          which surely had a small press-run. The Job suite, or at least individual plates from it,
          and editions of Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> with Blake’s illustrations also remain
          available year after year. Among the more important typographic books with Blake’s
          original graphics, only Thornton’s edition of Virgil’s <hi rend="i">Pastorals</hi> has
          become a true rarity. No complete, two-volume copy has appeared in several years. The
          present survey of books with commercial copy plates by or after Blake (excluding his sole
          broadside) includes only one genuinely scarce volume, Varley’s <hi rend="i">Treatise on
            Zodiacal Physiognomy.</hi></p>
        <p>This 1982-1983 review of sales follows the same format as its predecessor, except that
          the price-guide to secondary materials has been excluded. By adding 10-20% to account for
          the general inflation of book prices, one can still use the 1980-1981 list (see 
            <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 16 [fall 1982], 103-106) as a source for rough benchmark prices for
          the commoner facsimiles, typographic editions, catalogues, biographies, and critical
          studies.</p>

            a good many of the references to English bookdealer catalogues. His kindness and

            &amp; Ver Brugge, spring 79 portfolio 4, #3, all three pls. illus. ($15,000). The plates
            were returned by Zeitlin to the previous owner, the Oxfordshire bookdealer Colin

              <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (now collection of Haven O’Moore, Boston). I find this facsimile
            to be painfully ugly &amp; completely unlike Blake’s own work. Perhaps this “Beta” copy
            was executed by a child (Tommy Butts?).</p>

            Legends Inc., Oct. 83 private offer ($2500). Inscribed by Yeats on the frontis. to vol.
            I: “Ellis has proposed a fourth volume to contain the ‘errata’ list—the work is full of
            misprints. . . .” A fourth volume was never published. Yeats also notes that he worked
            for “4 years and . . . never got anything out of it but a few larger paper copies.”

                <head>8. The Felpham Rummer (see listing under “Separate Plates”).</head>
                <figDesc>Glass goblet, plain stem on a replacement plated foot, 14 cm. high, bowl
                  10.5 cm. diameter. According to Christopher Edwards of Pickering &amp; Chatto, the
                  present owners of the rummer, the engraved letters were very probably cut with a
                  diamond. A faint shadow of the angel, apparently etched rather than engraved, can
                  be seen through the back rim. Michael Phillips has pointed out that this is
                  probably the way the figure, which he suggests is a devil rather than an angel,
                  should be viewed while downing some demon rum. It is perhaps coincidental that the
                  picture of Blake’s workroom by Herbert Gilchrist (reproduced in Gilchrist, 
                    <hi rend="i">Life of Blake</hi> [1880], I, 348) includes several glasses (rummers?)
                  above the cupboard. Dr. Phillips also reminds me that the story of Blake’s
                  tribulations at Felpham was well known by the second half of the nineteenth
                  century, initially through the 1st ed. of Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of
                    Blake</hi> (1863) containing, in its 2nd vol., Blake’s anguished letters to
                  Thomas Butts of 1800-1803. In Gilchrist’s 2nd ed. (1880), these letters were given
                  more prominence as featured parts of revised chapters 18 and 19 in the 1st vol.
                  The court documents concerning Blake’s trial for sedition (1804) were first
                  published by W. Robertson Nicoll and Thomas J. Wise in a limited-edition pamphlet
                  and in their <hi rend="i">Literary Anecdotes of the Nineteenth Century</hi>
                  (1895). Wise’s active interest in Blake’s years at Felpham suggests the disturbing
                  possibility that he extended his well-documented talents as a forger into the
                  realm of Blakean glassware. Lacking information on the provenance of the rummer
                  prior to November 1982, one must remain skeptical of its authenticity. Photograph

                  “Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion” (added to the copper c. 1810-20),

                  stylized feathers in Blake’s work, but they are similar to one wing of the angel
