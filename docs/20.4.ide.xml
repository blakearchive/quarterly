        <p>To date, structural descriptions of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> have invariably
          treated narrative events as the unit of analysis—that is, the textual feature or features
          whose location in the text itself is examined, in relation to other similar or identical
          textual features, to identify an architectural plan. On this basis, both Northrop Frye and
          Harold Bloom divide the poem into three parts, corresponding to the fall, existence in the
          fallen state, and return to unfallen existence, although they disagree on where the
          divisions occur.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n20" type="note">1</ref> Subsequent
studies have generally
          accepted one or the other of these schemes.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n21"

            <note id="n20"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Northrop Frye, <hi rend="i">Fearful Symmetry: A Study of
              William Blake</hi> (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1947), p. 278; and Harold Bloom,
              <hi rend="i">Blake’s Apocalypse: A Study in Poetic Argument</hi> (Garden City, N.Y.:
            Doubleday, 1963), headings on pp. 193, 229, and 244.</note>
	<note id="n21"><hi rend="s">2</hi> See, for instance, Brian Wilkie and Mary Lynn Johnson,

        <p>Several critics have noted the reflections of Night I in Night IX, which are usually
          taken to indicate that Night I represents an inversion of the events of the
            apocalypse,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n22" type="note">3</ref> or that the
apocalypse is a completion
          of the fall.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n23" type="note">4</ref> All of these
studies regard structure as
          a function of a linear progression of narrative events, and most rely on Blake’s full
          myth, constructed from details scattered throughout the corpus, to provide associative
          links missing from the fragmentary narrative as well as a framework for the analysis
          itself. This implies that the reader must be familiar with Blake’s mythic system to fully
          understand the poem. However, the experience of even novice readers, who comprehend fully
          the poem’s general or thematic statements and are capable of understanding in some depth
          the meaning of specific episodes, belies this assumption. More importantly, it indicates
          that details of narrative, while perhaps providing a loose structural base, cannot alone
          account for the text’s internal coherence and cohesion, nor for the poem’s powerful effect
          on readers unfamiliar with the myth. <note id="n22"><hi rend="s">3</hi> See Wilkie and
            Johnson, p. 11.</note>
	<note id="n23"><hi rend="s">4</hi> Susan Fox, <hi rend="i">Poetic
              Form in Blake’s “Milton”</hi> (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1976), p.
          13.</note></p>
        <p>In view of this, I have attempted to identify and examine a feature or set of features
          other than the narrative that may contribute significantly to the structure of 
            <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> In particular, I have looked at Blake’s use of images as a
          vehicle for conveying broad, thematic statements within the poem and hence defining the
          dimensions of meaning that provide the basic framework for the structure of the work. The
          nature of Blake’s images and symbols has been studied extensively, and while initially
          Blake’s use of invented and borrowed names and symbols prompted critics to assert that his
          images are personal creations inaccessible to the reader without familiarity with Blake’s
          mythic system, several critics—notably, Northrop Frye in <hi rend="i">Fearful
            Symmetry</hi>—have shown that Blake’s symbols abound in general and archetypal
          qualities. The terms in which his myth is expressed—such as fire and ice, youth and age,
          light and darkness—are among those universal images that possess the greatest constancy
          and efficiency, and so their connotations are strikingly familiar and clear. Thus, as the
          reader proceeds through the text of the <hi rend="i">Zoas</hi>, a large part of his
          impression of the fictive world is created by these images, which, because of their
          overwhelming abundance as well as the accessibility of their connotations, stand in bold
          relief against the obscurity of the narrative. Without the usual narrative context to
          supply at least superficial meaning for an image, its effect depends, first, upon its
          habitual and/or traditional connotations and associations for the reader. So, individual
          images in the <hi rend="i">Zoas</hi> can be seen as isolatable conceptual elements with
          identifiable connotations for most readers; their substantial role in determining the
          reader’s impression of the work suggests that they may contribute significantly to the
          structure of ideas underlying the text.</p>
        <p>My effort to get at the ways in which imagery contributes to structure and meaning in 
            <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> involved, first, an attempt to identify and locate the
          important images within the poem—specifically, visual images whose connotations are, for
          the most part, fixed for the majority of readers. To do this I utilized a multipurpose
          computer program for text analysis,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n24"

          modified version of the machine-readable text of the <hi rend="i">Zoas</hi> prepared by

        <p>After establishing the image categories, I once again utilized the computer program to
          generate frequency distributions across the text for each of them. These distributions
          were then examined to identify patterns within and among them that might provide insight
          into the structure of the poem. I approached the distributions with two underlying
          assumptions: first, that meaning in the poem is determined in part by relationships among
          images in terms of proximity, where distance between two images defines the degree of
          relatedness between them, and relative predominance, which is determined by relative
          frequency among images at a particular location in the text; and, second, that patterns in
          the appearance and reappearance of particular images or clusters of images and ebb and
          flow in image density and variety yield insight into the structure of the poem. Therefore,
          I looked at places in the text where occurrences of specific images tend to be
          concentrated, assuming that a significant increase in the number of times an image appears
          in a given passage indicates that it plays a primary role in determining the meaning of
          that passage. I also examined configurations in the distribution of both individual image
          categories and groups of related categories across the text, to identify an architectural
          plan. A detailed analysis of image patterns and of the semantic effects of imagery for
          each individual passage in <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> appears elsewhere;<ref

          established within the text itself. Images such as “drown” and “smile” have also been
          omitted from the analysis, for while they satisfy the definition of an image by calling up
          a sensory representation in the reader’s mind, these images participate in meaning
          primarily at the narrative level, and therefore do not contribute as significantly to
          meaning at the general or thematic level with which the analysis is concerned; in

        <p>Patterns of image distribution across the text will be discussed here with reference to
          the nine Nights of the poem, but before doing so it is necessary to clarify the
          positioning of the Nights along a linear axis representing the text.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n31"
            type="note">12</ref> The Nights vary considerably in length, and many of the
          distributions reveal patterns related to a position along the axis rather than to the
          Nights themselves. The positioning of the Nights along an axis representing the entire
          text is as follows: <figure n="Graph.bqscan" rend="file" width="600" height="244"/> Notice that although Night V
is
          numerically the central Night of the nine, the first half of the poem in terms of its
          total length includes Nights I through VI. In fact, the number of words in Nights I
          through VI differs by only about fifty from the number in Nights VII, VIII, and IX. 
            <note id="n31"><hi rend="s">12</hi> For the purpose of generating the frequency distributions
            for images within the text, the <hi rend="i">Zoas</hi> was treated as a seamless whole,
            without regard for Blake’s division of the poem into nine Nights. I will argue below
            that there are several good reasons to ignore these divisions, at least when attempting
            to get at the poem’s structure.</note></p>
        <p>Patterns of image distribution across the text of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> show
          several kinds of structuring at work in the poem. First of all, in terms of general mood,
          tone, and atmosphere conveyed through imagery, the poem divides neatly into two sections
          of equal length, the first including Nights I through VI and the second including Nights
          VII, VIII, and IX. The imagery of Night VI is the most relentlessly dismal of the poem,
          dominated by images of fire, deserts and sand, mountains, rocks, lightning and thunder,
          slime and mold, serpents, monsters, and the abyss. Night VI represents the lowest point in
          the story of the fall of man, with which the text of the <hi rend="i">Zoas</hi> is
          concerned; the nights that precede and follow Night VI relate the descent into the depths
          of fallen existence and the return to the unfallen state, and so it is not surprising that
          the imagery of both sections becomes more positive as the distance from Night VI
          increases.</p>
        <p>In addition to this rather simple pattern, four other significant configurations were
          revealed. The first is based on the flux in image density across the text; imagery is
          concentrated in three areas of the text, which are separated by two text segments
          containing relatively low numbers of images. Patterns indicate a repetition of many of the
          same images in the three areas of high image density, and a marked shift in the character
          of

          images between areas of high and low image density. Second, although in several
          areas of the text images from an earlier Night or Nights are repeated, the symmetric
          reflection of images from the first two Nights of the poem in the scenes of the apocalypse
          in Night IX is by far the strongest pattern of repetition—this, we must assume, is at
          least partly responsible for critical assertions of similarities between the poem’s
          beginning and end. Third, the flux in image density is characterized by a rhythmic
          alternation that is mimicked in the more rapid alternation of concentrations of images of
          labor and rest across the text. Finally, the scenes of the apocalypse contain almost every
          image that appears in the first eight Nights of the poem. This suggests that the
          apocalypse represents a holistic vision of the events and environment depicted in the
          earlier sections of the poem.</p>
        <p>The most dramatic pattern of image distribution in the text, and the one that dominates
          the imagistic structure of the poem, involves all of the 196 images considered in the
          analysis. The distributions show that both the number and variety of images increase
          significantly in three general areas of the text. Based on this flux in image density, the
          text of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> can be roughly divided into five segments. The
          first segment spans Nights I and II, the second covers Nights III and IV, the third
          includes Nights V and VI and the first ninety lines of Night VII, the fourth segment spans
          the remainder of Night VII and most of Night VIII, and the last segment includes the last
          third of Night VIII and all of Night IX. The first, middle, and last segments contain the
          highest concentrations of imagery in the poem; in the two intervening segments, both the
          number and variety of images are considerably 
          lower.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n32" type="note">13</ref>

          and density, and within each of the segments, variations on these patterns
          appear. Notably, in each of the areas of high image density, secondary patterns indicating
          an ebb and flow of image variety and density are evident, especially in the final segment;
          and in the fourth segment, which contains some of the lowest concentrations of imagery in
          the entire text, a sudden increase in image levels occurs in Night VIII where Orc’s
          serpent form and Urizen’s military hardware are described. However, the level achieved in
          this segment reaches only that of the lowest levels in areas where images are greatest in
          number and variety. <note id="n32"><hi rend="s">13</hi> See charts 2 and 3.</note></p>
        <p>The overall pattern of alternation between areas of high and low image density, in
          itself, affects the reader’s perception of the poem. An increase in image levels will
          increase the dimensions of meaning and emphasis in a passage, which creates the impression
          of a broadening of scene amid an expansion of perspective. A decrease in imagery creates
          the opposite impression; the reader senses that the breadth of his view is constricted,
          and therefore that his perspective on the events and scenes within the narrative is more
          limited. In addition, a reduction in imagistic connotations places more emphasis on
          narrative meaning. Thus, the effect of the fluctuations in image density in the text is a
          sense of steady alternation between expansion and contraction of view, and between
          emphasis on the broadened scene and on the action within the narrative itself.</p>
        <p>This sense is evident within the narrative of the <hi rend="i">Zoas.</hi> Each of the
          segments of the text characterized by high levels of imagery contains a substantial number
          of scenes in which the reader is provided with an expanded view of existence from the
          perspective of the stage of the fall or regeneration of man in which the account appears.
          The song at the feast and Enion’s first lament in Night I provide a vision of the world of
          experience, and in Night II, although the scene is less expansive than the one in the song
          at the marriage feast, the reader is given a full view of Urizen’s Mundane Shell. Enion’s
          second lament at the end of Night II provides another vision of the world of experience.
          Nights V and VI include enlarged views in the description of the bound Orc, Urizen’s
          memory of Eternity in his lament at the end of Night V, and the extended view of Urizen’s
          dens, in which the horrifying vision of existence under Urizen’s tyranny appears. Early in
          Night VII, the reader is provided with a view of Orc’s caverns. Ahania’s lament at the end
          of Night VIII puts forth yet another vision of existence, and in the early lines of Night
          IX, the first scenes of the apocalypse provide an encompassing picture of the universe in
          upheaval. The last thirty-one lines of the poem present a sweeping vision of life in
          Eternity. Even within the pastoral interlude in Night IX, the panorama is enlarged; the
          reader is provided with a view of Vala’s pastures, hills, and valleys, as well as a
          description of the house Luvah builds for her, and he sees Vala gathering fruit in her lap
          and walking to the river where she sees Tharmas. Very few scenes in <hi rend="i">The Four
            Zoas</hi> provide such details of spatial organization among elements of landscape.</p>
        <p>The intervening segments of the poem contain far fewer scenes embodying a broadened
          perspective, and the reader’s viewpoint is instead that of one or more of the Zoas, who
          are intimately involved in the action and events of the poem. In Night III, where image
          levels drop dramatically, the narrative focuses on an argument between Urizen and Ahania;
          Ahania’s lament broadens the scene somewhat, but her focus is on the individuals involved
          in the events leading to the fall and provides no expansive vision. The subsequent scene
          of the destruction of the Mundane Shell is limited in scope and meaning by its
          proliferation of only images of chaos and fragmentation, which continue to dominate into
          the early lines of Night IV. In the later lines of Night IV, we see Los binding Urizen;
          the description of the body he forges for Urizen focuses on an individual entity and is,
          again, limited in scope and meaning by the relatively few images involved. Night VII
          focuses first on Urizen, Orc, and Urizen’s daughters, and then on the activities of Los,
          Enitharmon, and the Spectre of Urthona. Los’s lament provides a brief broadening of scene,
          but not the variety of imagery or scope of the scenes in Nights I, V, and IX. The later
          lines of Night VII depict the embraces of Enitharmon and the Spectre and Los and the
          Spectre, and the birth of the Shadowy Female—the reader is given a close view of these
          events, and no larger view is provided. In the first two-thirds of Night VIII, several
          scenes involving Urizen’s war efforts and Los’s and Enitharmon’s weaving are presented,
          but the imagery is generally unvaried and provides no substantial 
          <pb id="p20-129" n="129"/>
broadening of perspective. Imagery in the scene of the crucifixion, where
image levels
          reach their lowest point in the entire poem, is so sparse that the lack of imagistic
          meaning heightens the significance of the act itself.</p>
        <p>The text segments characterized by low image density are, for the most part, more plot
          oriented than the sections of the poem containing the densest concentrations of imagery.
          Therefore, the reader’s perception of events is very similar to that of the individuals
          involved in them. In areas of high image density, plot is interwoven with set pieces
          providing inclusive visions of existence from the perspective of the current stage of the
          fall. Thus the reader’s experience of the poem is one of alternation between involvement
          in the action and stepping outside it to obtain a larger view. These variations contribute
          significantly to the poem’s meaning—one of Blake’s fundamental tenets concerns the
          necessity for variation in perspective and the need for alternation between involvement
          and rest. Here, Blake makes his point, not by exposition, but rather by directly involving
          the reader in the experience itself.</p>
        <p>The links established by image density among the first, middle, and last segments of the
          poem are strengthened by shared images—that is, images that appear in significant
          concentrations in these three areas of the text, but appear only rarely, if at all, in the
          segments of the poem characterized by low image density. This symmetrical, three-part
          pattern is particularly evident in distributions for images of wine, blood, children or
          youth, the feast, mountains, valleys, and gold; it also shows up in distributions for
          images of the garden, ivory, insects, the lion, and stars. The most important of these
          images—in terms of the extent to which they define meaning and atmosphere in the passages
          in which they appear—are images of wine, blood, youth, and the feast; and each of these
          images appears in the first two segments only in specific scenes: in Night I at the scene
          of the marriage feast (including the song at the feast and Enion’s lament), and in Night V
          in the scenes of Orc’s birth and binding or in Urizen’s lament. Of these, the most
          significant is the wine image, whose occurrences are concentrated in the scene at the
          marriage feast, Urizen’s lament, and in Night IX at the feast and in the scene where
          “Human Wine” is made in Luvah’s winepress. Similarly, the blood image is concentrated in
          the song at the feast, the description of Orc’s birth and the Demon’s account of the fall
          that immediately follows, and in the first scenes of the apocalypse in Night IX; and
          images of children or youth appear significantly in the song at the feast, descriptions of
          the young Orc in Night V, and in the pastoral interlude in Night IX. The image of the
          feast appears, of course, in the scenes of feasts in Nights I and IX, and in Urizen’s
          lament in Night V. None of these images appears in substantial numbers in any other part
          of the poem.</p>
        <p>While these images exhibit a three-part distribution in areas of high image density,
          others exhibit a two-part distributional pattern, appearing in substantial concentrations
          in either the first and last or middle and last of these three segments. The first and
          last segments of the text are far more strongly related in terms of shared imagery than
          any other areas of the text. Each of these two segments contains concentrations of the
          major agricultural images in the poem—the plow, the harvest, corn, and images related to
          the sowing of seed. Significant numbers of images of nations, towns, villages, cities,
          families, ashes, sand, the wilderness and wild animals, the ox, autumn, bees, birds, moon,
          dew, dove, winter, slaves, thorns and nettles, structures, girls, the sun, and the
            Earth<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n33" type="note">14</ref> appear in these
two portions of the poem as
          well. The middle and last segments of the poem share fewer images; however, the middle
          segment shares with the opening scenes of the apocalypse a sudden and dramatic increase in
          the number of images of fire, whose explosion into these scenes is so overwhelming that
          their character is almost wholly defined by it. The effect in both scenes is so pronounced
          that the allusion is obvious when the reader encounters the opening lines of Night IX.
          Elsewhere in the last segment, images of music, castle, palace, crow, and crystal appear,
          whose only other substantial concentrations occur in the middle segment. 
              <note id="n33"><hi rend="s">14</hi> For the purposes of image categorization, a distinction was
made
            between occurrences of the word “earth” referring to the ground or soil, and of the
            Earth as a planet or location, as in “the Earth, the sun, and the stars” or “all men on
            Earth.” References to the Earth as a planet were found to occur primarily in the first
            and last Nights of the poem.</note></p>
        <p>The imagery of the first and middle segments of the poem indicates something about the
          character of the passages themselves, and the reintroduction of some of the most important
          images from the first segment in the scenes of Nights V and VI, and of images from both of
          these segments in Night IX, shows Blake at work again manipulating the reader’s perception
          to make a fundamental point—in this case, that perspective defines meaning, and that
          moving among a variety of perspectives ultimately enables the holistic vision that
          characterizes Blake’s idea of imaginative apprehension. In the earliest segment, the major
          images are of nature, the social order, and agricultural labor, which is basically an
          integration of society and nature; the general impression is of man existing in the
          physical world, the world of ordinary experience, which corresponds to Blake’s Generation.
          In the scene at the marriage feast, images of blood, wine, and youth are introduced,
          introducing further <corr type="emend">connotations</corr> of human suffering and sacrifice,
especially the sacrifice
          of youth and energy to toil in the physical world. In the middle segment, the images of
          wine, blood, and youth again appear, but here they are coupled with images of fire,
          primarily, which draws out connotations of the violent and passionate energy of youth.
          Later, more images of nature, including the mountain and valley images that appear
          significantly in the first segment of high image density, appear, but again, their
          coupling with images of fire, rocks, deserts, serpents, monsters, slime and mold,
          lightnings and 
          <pb id="p20-130" n="130"/> 
          thunder, and the abyss shows nature in a
          different aspect. The imagistic and narrative allusions in the middle segment of the poem,
          as well as the increase in numbers and variety of images itself, remind the reader of the
          earlier scene; but the character of the new images substantially alters the meaning of the
          whole. Thus the reader is forced to reconsider his earlier perception, and by recognizing
          a second perspective, moves beyond the viewpoint defined by one or the other of these
          perspectives and subsumes the two. In the final segment of the poem, where images from
          both the first and middle segments appear along with other images drawn from everywhere in
          the first eight Nights of the poem, the effect is similar; while the meaning in the scenes
          of the apocalypse is defined substantially by the images within it and the relationships
          among them, the appearance of images from earlier portions of the text invokes alternative
          connotations, and in comparing them the reader moves to a higher level of abstraction and
          recognizes not only that alternative meanings exist, but also that meaning is
          substantially defined by context.</p>
        <p>The particular evocation through both shared imagery and narrative allusion of the
          earliest Nights of the poem in the scenes of the apocalypse creates the further impression
          of returning to the beginnings of the poem, but again, the differences in context as well
          as the experience of the intervening segments of the poem clearly demonstrate how
          perspective shapes what we see. Obviously, the possibilities for allusion to previous
          appearances of an image or images are far greater in the final segment than they are at
          any previous point in the poem, and this basic fact is essential to our understanding of
          the way the poem works. For it implies that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for
          the reader to perceive the apocalyptic vision if he had not progressed through the more
          limited perspectives of the preceding Nights. This demonstrates a fundamental Blakean
          principle: that progression is necessary to achieve imaginative vision, and that “Without
          Contraries is no progression.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n34"
type="note">15</ref> It further
          demonstrates that much of the connotative power of Night IX is achieved through narrative
          and imagistic allusion—by referring to the connotations of an image in earlier contexts,
          meaning can be layered upon meaning, and the whole enhanced by recognition of the way in
          which meaning is conveyed. Thus the two expanded views take on added importance in the
          scheme of the poem, for they provide the raw material for Blake’s superlative achievement
          in the poem’s final movement. <note id="n34"><hi rend="s">15</hi><hi rend="i"> The

        <p>Images in the two areas of lower image saturation are not only fewer in number and
          variety, but also fundamentally different from those in the other three segments of the
          poem. Furthermore, unlike the three segments characterized by high image saturation, the
          two share very few images, and, as a result, the character of each differs significantly.
          Among those images they do share, the shadow image pervades both segments, as does the eye
            image,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n35" type="note">16</ref> and
concentrations of the image of tears
          appear at the end of Night III and the beginning of Night IV, and in Night VIII.<ref
            target="n36" type="note">17</ref> Otherwise, the imagery of the two segments differs
          entirely. The first area of low image saturation contains substantial concentrations of
          images of clouds, the sea, storms, water, bones, chains, ice and snow, clearly suggesting
          the chaos and fragmentation that result from the breaking up of the Mundane Shell. In the
          second of these segments, images of tree, fruit, pastoral landscape, flower, worm, war,
          implements of torture, veil, and garment dominate. In both segments, the imagery is
          fundamentally negative in its connotations; the positive implications of pastoral imagery
          and images of vegetation in the second segment are undermined by extremely heavy
          concentrations of images of worm and shadow in Night VII, and the overall impression is of
          nature that is visually appealing but debased and spoiled. Concealment plays a major role
          in the thematic implications of both segments, but in the first, concealment is conveyed
          through images of nature (primarily, the cloud image), whereas in the second it is
          conveyed more predominantly through images related to that which is specifically human
          (veil, garment). The imagery of both segments shows a connotative shift at roughly a
          halfway point: in the first, imagery shifts from formless objects (cloud, water, sea) to
          forbiddingly solid forms (ice, bone, chain, iron); in the second, imagery moves from the
          natural and organic to the manmade 
          (war, veil, garment, gem).<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n37" type="note">18</ref>
          These marked shifts are indicative of the advances in plot that are evident in
          these two areas of the text. <note id="n35"><hi rend="s">16</hi> The most significant
            concentration of the eye image occurs in the pastoral interlude of Night IX.</note>
            <note id="n36"><hi rend="s">17</hi> Lesser concentrations of the tear image appear in the
            early lines of Night I and in the pastoral interlude in Night IX. Thus its distribution
            is roughly symmetrical around the poem’s midpoint.</note>
            <note id="n37"><hi rend="s">18</hi> While gems are from nature, their meaning derives from the
value man has
            attributed to them. Also, human intervention is usually required to produce gems that
            are used for ornamentation, as are the gems in the description of Orc’s serpent form in
            Night VIII.</note></p>
        <p>Several images appear in only one significant concentration, and notably, almost all of
          these appear in one of the two areas of low image 
          saturation.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n38" type="note">19</ref> 
          The sea image occurs in only one primary concentration, at the end of Night
          III and in the first third of Night IV, where it is used to characterize the onslaught of
          chaos that accompanies the destruction of the Mundane Shell. The tree image appears
          primarily in Nights VII and VIII, in passages dealing with the Tree of Mystery, and the
          gem image is concentrated in the description of Orc’s serpent form in Night VIII. Again,
          in areas of high saturation, the variety of images broadens scene and 
          <figure n="BirdDragon.20.4.bqscan" rend="file" width="250" height="107"/>
          <pb id="p20-131" n="131"/> 
          meaning; by contrast, the dominance of individual images in areas
          of low saturation limits the possible connotations and, consequently, the viewpoint.</p>
        <p>Distributions for groups of images that fall into a broad conceptual category were also
          generated during the course of the analysis, and certain clearly defined patterns were
          revealed. In particular, clusters of images that can be collectively regarded as images of
          the pastoral—birds, flowers, sheep, shepherd, cattle, hills, pastures, and so on—are
          distributed symmetrically around the middle point of the poem, and, more importantly,
          their appearance tends to alternate regularly throughout the text with images of labor,
          including the loom, furnace and hammer, the winepress, the harvest, the vintage,
          breadmaking, and the plow.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n39" type="note">20</ref>
          This alternation is more
          rapid than the flux in image density, but the two patterns complement one another. The
          rapid alternation of images of the pastoral and labor, which are more closely tied to
          events of the narrative than patterns of image saturation, model the daily alternation of
          activity and rest in the physical world, while the slower and more dramatic pulsation of
          image saturation more closely reflects yearly rhythms and the cycle of death and renewal.
            <note id="n38"><hi rend="s">19</hi> Exceptions to this are images of houses, grass, and
            sheep, each of which appears in a single significant concentration in the pastoral
            interlude of Night IX.</note>

        <p>The effect of these rhythms on the reader, however subtle it may be, should not be
          underestimated. Blake’s use of rhythm for effect in individual passages has often been
          noted by critics, and it is not unreasonable to assume that such rhythms may operate on a
          larger scale within the <hi rend="i">Zoas.</hi> Anyone familiar with the poem is aware of
          its power—power that cannot be accounted for in the narrative alone. Some of this may be
          attributed to the almost subconscious appeal of rhythms revealed in image patterns. In
          Nights V and VI, which constitute the imagistic center of the poem, such rhythms are
          brought into the narrative when Urizen searches for the source of the pulsation that
          “shakes [his] caverns with strong shudders” (V, 65:239; E 344). The pulsation is
          introduced in Night V at the height of image saturation in the description of the bound
          Orc, continues through Night VI during Urizen’s search, and finally explodes in fire
          imagery at the opening of Night VII. The intensity of the reader’s experience of this part
          of the text may derive in large part from the introduction into the narrative of an
          element conveyed through image patterns in the earlier Nights of the poem.</p>
        <p>In the final one thousand lines of the text, from the crucifixion of Christ in Night VIII
          onwards, the vision of the apocalypse explodes in a sustained concentration of imagery
          whose variety is unequaled in any other area of the poem. The final vision of the
          apocalypse is the imaginative view that sees all elements of existence integrated into an
          inclusive and harmonious whole. Consequently, the images in this segment of the text are
          drawn from every one of the previous Nights; in fact, among the 196 images examined in
          this study, only four—cliff, bellows, maze, and sparks—do not appear at least once in the
          final segment.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n40" type="note">21</ref> Bloom
describes Night IX as “Blake’s
          most exuberant and inventive poetry, probably the most energetic and awesome in the
            language,”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n41" type="note">22</ref> and Frye
offers a similarly superlative
          comment—“There is nothing like the colossal explosion of creative power in the ninth Night

            type="note">23</ref> This exuberance and energy are achieved, in large part, through
          Blake’s imagistic elaboration that literally overwhelms the reader with its visual and
          connotative richness. Frye adds that “The poet works with physical images, and hence every
          successful vision of a state of existence beyond the physical must be an immense triumph
          of technical skill.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n43" type="note">24</ref> One
of the prime elements of
          Blake’s achievement is his integration of a multitude of diverse images into a composite
          vision of Eternity—like Blake’s well-known drawings of the Last Judgment, the final Night
          of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> derives its power as much from the proliferation of
          images as from their connotations. <note id="n40"><hi rend="s">21</hi> This statistic does
            not take into account incidental images that were grouped in more inclusive categories
            for the purposes of the distribution analysis. For example, the snail, which occurs only
            at one location in the poem in Night II, was grouped with other creatures of the

        <p>The rhythmic alternation of images of labor and the pastoral, and the slower and more
          dramatic rhythm of the flux in image density throughout the poem, are reflected in the
          image patterns of Night IX. The pastoral interlude appears at the midpoint of the last
          Night, and interrupts the furious activity of the apocalypse. The restful scenes of the
          interlude are characterized by a reduction in the variety of images, although the number
          of images remains relatively high, and so in Night IX we see a grand enactment of the
          rhythmic pulsations that occur throughout the first eight Nights. The interlude 
            <pb id="p20-132" n="132"/>
also invokes the perspective of the areas of low image density
          earlier in the poem: although the scene is broadened and elements of landscape are well
          defined, the pastoral interlude presents a close view of Vala, Tharmas, and Enion. The
          reader’s involvement with their activities and perspective is far greater than in the
          surrounding scenes of apocalyptic fury, and because the variety of images is lower, the
          connotations are also limited in relation to adjacent passages. Once again, the final
          lines of the poem both double back to repeat earlier patterns and enlarge upon them, thus
          providing a substantially enhanced version of both forms of rhythmic pulsation that
          pervade the earlier Nights of the poem.</p>
        <p>Image patterns across the text of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> reveal that the basic
          structure of the poem is composed of three parts defined by the flux in image density. The
          reader is provided with three expansive views of existence from three perspectives, the
          last of which subsumes the first two. Thus, the structure of the poem is based on multiple
          views which can be regarded as simultaneous because they present many of the same images
          in varying contexts. The poem’s structure, then, can be described as “layered.” The
          structure is also fundamentally symmetrical, since many of the poem’s images are
          distributed symmetrically around its midpoint. However, the integration of imagery from
          the first eight Nights into the final vision of the last movement suggests a linear
          organization, where images are accumulated across the text for their combined presentation
          in the last lines of the poem.</p>
        <p>The structural configuration of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> revealed by image
          patterns differs from descriptions based on narrative—such as those of Frye and Bloom—in
          three respects. First, linearity assumes a secondary role in the overall structure; even
          if the first eight Nights are regarded as a sequence of viewpoints leading to apocalypse,
          the notion of linearity is destroyed in the last thousand lines, which in subsuming images
          from the previous Nights double back and reflect earlier patterns. Second, while the
          pattern of image density across the text indicates a fundamentally three-part
          configuration, these three parts coincide only partially with structural divisions
          outlined by Frye and Bloom. Both critics see a structural division that falls somewhere
          between the first and second segments characterized by high image density, but Frye puts
          the division following Night IV, and Bloom puts it after Night III. Frye’s second division
          occurs at the end of Night VIII, with the third area of maximum density, while Bloom’s
          second division at the end of Night VI falls within the second segment of dense imagery.
          Neither Frye nor Bloom recognizes any subdivision within the sections he outlines, whereas
          my interpretation sees an alternation between expansion and contraction of view in the
          first eight Nights of the poem.</p>
        <p>Finally, the flux in image density suggests an organizational scheme that in most
          instances violates the divisions among the nine Nights. Until now, critics have regarded
          the individual Nights as inviolable units of the poem’s structure. It is impossible to
          argue that the division into Nights is insignificant, since Blake himself imposed the
          scheme on the poem, but this does not mean that the poem’s organization, at least on some
          level, is not based on an alternative scheme—perhaps one that is superimposed on the more
          intricate division into Nights, and which complements the poem’s narrative structure. Even
          within the poem, the divisions between Nights rarely indicate a break in the action or a
          thematic shift; in fact, in most cases Blake seems to have made an effort to obscure these
            divisions.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n44" type="note">25</ref> Even if the
narrative is used as a
          guide for determining the poem’s structural components, we do not find nine clearly
          delineated segments defined by the nine Nights; and, because of the confusion of narrative
          chronology in the poem, even Frye and Bloom cannot agree on a scheme for grouping the
          Nights. Whatever the significance of Blake’s divisions, they have not yet yielded a clear
          structural scheme, except in very general terms. Based on the evidence provided by
          patterns of image distribution across the text, it seems necessary to consider that in its
          broader dimensions, the poem’s organization may not have its basis in the divisions among
          the nine Nights. <note id="n44"><hi rend="s">25</hi> Five Nights begin with conjunctions
            or conjunctive adverbs that link the opening lines with the ending of the previous
            Night: Night IV begins with “But,” Night VI with “So,” Nights VII and VIII with
“Then,”
            and Night IX with “And.” In the opening lines of Night V, the dance of Los begun at the
            end of Night IV is continued.</note></p>
        <p>The reader’s experience of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> is fundamentally one of
          variation and expansion of perspective. Repetitions and variations of image patterns
          provide the reader with different perspectives on the condition of man at various points
          in the fall, and these perspectives are later integrated into the larger vision that both
          includes and evolves from them. When he sees the same images repeated in varying contexts,
          the reader recognizes that perspective defines meaning—and this is one of the fundamental
          tenets of Blake’s philosophy. The domination of certain images and types of images in
          various passages demonstrates the effects on perspective of emphasis of one element over
          the other; the harmonious integration of images in the scenes at the end of Night IX
          provides the balanced view that is characteristic of imaginative vision. Alternating
          patterns of image density and of images of labor and rest almost subconsciously establish
          a heightened appreciation of rhythmic alternation that is most dramatically apparent in
          the interposition of the pastoral interlude amid the furious activity of Night IX, and
          which, again, is a fundamental aspect of Blake’s vision of life in Eternity. Thus, meaning
          and method in the poem overlap, for the underlying theme is certainly that the separation
          of the four Zoas, and the resulting fragmentation of vision, created the fall, and that
          the imaginative act of reintegration reestablished Edenic bliss. The reader not only finds
          this meaning in the narrative, but also participates in a similar imaginative act in his
          apprehension of the poem’s images and their dramatic patterning across the text.</p>
