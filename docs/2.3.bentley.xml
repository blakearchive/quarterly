                    <p>Mr Martin Butlin tells me that copies of Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>
seem to have been coloured in two distinct styles, the first of about 1797, and the second, similar in effect
to the coloured copies of Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Triumphs of Temper</hi> (1803, owned by Mr George Goyder)
and <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805, owned by Professor S. Foster Damon), of about 1805. The ascriptions of
colouring dates below derive from Mr Butlin.</p>
