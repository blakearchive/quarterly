            <title type="main">Steven Blakemore. <hi rend="i">Burke and the Fall of Language: The French
Revolution as Linguistic Event.</hi> Hanover, NH: University Press of New England, 1988. 115 pp. $20.</title>
          </head>

          <p>Starting with the basic premise that linguistic interpretations of revolutions are as viable and
important as economic, sociopolitical, or ideological ones, Steven Blakemore’s book contributes to
revisionist critiques of the French Revolution. <hi rend="i">Burke and the Fall of Language</hi> explores the
language of revolutionary and counterrevolutionary discourse. Although Blakemore focuses on Burkean texts and
themes, he also analyzes the “special linguistic self-consciousness” (2) that shapes all visions of the
revolution. While the author makes no mention of Blake (nor of literary tradition per se), this exploration of
the nexus between language and ideology contributes much to a methodology for analyzing Blake’s
revolutionary texts. Not only has Blakemore assembled valuable historical material, for instance on the
debates over constitution, authority, and patriarchy, but also his contextualizing of the poles of
revolutionary and counterrevolutionary texts amidst these themes provides a revealing, albeit narrowly
focused, account.</p>
          <p>The title, which implies that language is the unified focus of study, is misleading in that only
the last half of the slender book deals specifically with the language of revolution. The first three of the
six chapters offer background information on what the author considers the significant bases of the arguments
and how Burke and Paine exploit various topoi for their respective
<pb id="p24-103" n="103"/>

political purposes. For example, Burke argues for a constitution that exists “time out of mind” (8) in an
unwritten past preserving traditional meanings whereas Paine insists that a constitution’s legitimacy comes
from writing, as evidenced by the American colonists’ document. Legitimacy of governmental authority is also
“proven” by both sides through an argument from origins. Burke’s authority rests in an “ancient”
origin that is “unknowable and hence fruitless to trace” (21). Blakemore points out that Paine
strategically emphasizes a Biblical myth of origins that predates Burke’s abstract “ancient” sources.
This answer to Burke is very similar to the way in which Blake’s <hi rend="i">French Revolution</hi>
emphasizes France’s “ancient” liberties (as Michael Ferber has noted, the word carries a largely Burkean
resonance throughout the poem). Finally, Blakemore contrasts how the language of patriarchy is used by both
sides. Burke had used this argument in defense of the American revolution, but Blakemore notes this change of
heart: “Whereas Burke envisions the American Revolution as the oppressive father denying the American child
his constitutional rights, he envisions the French Revolution as a revolt of the child against his natural
parents” (38).</p>
          <p>Although the historical topics of the first half are rewarding, the last half of the book is even
more so as Blakemore delves into the connection between language and ideology by examining Burke’s belief
that revolutionary criticism of government, religion, and, above all, language means a fall from innocence; a
“stripping of linguistic veils” (70) actually creates chaos. Thus the revolution as a radical linguistic
event was one that upset the entire worldview. Blakemore discusses specific historical linguistic arguments
over classical versus vernacular language, the establishment of a new “national” language, and the
renaming of the French calendar and streets. In fact, the revolutionaries wanted a demystification of language
that would change the title French King to “king of the French,” so that common men would not be, as Paine
said, “immured in the Bastille of a word.” The final chapter, which is somewhat loosely joined to the rest
of the book (perhaps due to its being printed earlier in <hi rend="i">Eighteenth-Century Studies</hi>)
explores Burke’s nostalgia for the aristocracy in terms of language and his fear that revolution would
create a second Babel or worse.</p>
          <p>Throughout the book, Blakemore keeps his eye on Burke’s “majestic presence,” and this not
so subtle reverence for Burke may annoy some readers, but the well-written final chapter successfully argues
for Burke’s “modern” sensitivity to language. Blakemore’s study, aside from its value as a compendium
of important revolutionary arguments of Burke and Paine, employs a rewarding method of interpreting discourse
as a dialectic in sociopolitical reality, a strategy especially fruitful in Blake studies, as Blake directly
and indirectly reinterprets Locke, Newton, and Burke. Blakemore’s study intends uppermost to remind us how
much language alters our perception of reality and, indeed, that any interpretation of history or literature
is “bounded by the very language that expresses it” (105).</p>
