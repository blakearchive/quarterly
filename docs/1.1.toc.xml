                    <figTranscr>Blake Newsletter<lb/>
                        Number 1<lb/>
                        June 15, 1967<lb/>
                        The idea of having a Blake Newsletter seems to have sprung like<lb/>
                        Leutha from the head of Satan; I don’t know who can claim paternity.  The<lb/>
                        need seemed suddenly obvious.  Much help was given in the early stages by<lb/>
                        David Erdman, who called a meeting of Blake scholars at the last MLA<lb/>
                        convention and who also sent out a preliminary announcement.  Gerald E.<lb/>
                        Bentley, Jr. contributed valuable suggestions and prodding.  Robert<lb/>
                        Whitehead sent a list of ongoing Blake projects.  There were encouraging<lb/>
                        letters and contributions from Blake scholars in seven different countries.<lb/>
                        This modest first issue is the result, and it is now up to you whether<lb/>
                        the project deserves to be continued.<lb/>
                        As far as editorial policy is concerned, I think the Newsletter<lb/>
                        should be just that — not an incipient journal.  (Enough are born, even<lb/>
                        too many, without these arts).  It will include announcements, queries,<lb/>
                        controversy, and notes of special interest to Blake scholars — all of an<lb/>
                        informal nature (a “family wall-newspaper,” as David Erdman puts it).<lb/>
                        Regarding work-in-progress, my own inclination is to report on ongoing<lb/>
                        editorial and bibliographical projects, but not on critical or scholarly<lb/>
                        studies before they are completed.  In that way, I hope to avoid the<lb/>
                        suggestion of “reserving” subjects.  However, I’d like to have readers’<lb/>
                        views on this, as well as on other subjects.<lb/>
                        I’ll undertake to publish issues of the Newsletter on October 15,<lb/>
                        January 15, and April 15.  The subscription price will be two dollars,<lb/>
                        which will cover the first four issues, including this one.  New readers<lb/>
                        will receive back issues as part of their subscription — any other<lb/>
                        arrangement would involve book-keeping complications that I’m not able to<lb/>
                        undertake.<lb/>
                        The second issue of the Newsletter will be dedicated to S. Foster<lb/>
                        Damon.  Former students and associates of Professor Damon are especially<lb/>
                        invited to contribute.<lb/>
                        The BLAKE NEWSLETTER is edited by Morton D. Paley, Dept. of English,<lb/>
                        University of California, Berkeley, Calif. 94720.  Subscription price:<lb/>
                        two dollars for one year (four issues).  Please make checks payable to<lb/>
                        Morton D. Paley.</figTranscr>
