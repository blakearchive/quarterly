          <note id="n0">* <hi rend="i">Editor’s note: Addenda and corrigenda to</hi> Blake Records, 
<hi rend="i">2nd ed. (2004), which have traditionally formed an appendix to this article, now appear on the
journal’s web site &lt;http://www.blakequarterly.org&gt;. They will be updated yearly.</hi></note>
          <p><hi rend="b">Blake Publications and Discoveries in 2009</hi></p>
          <p>Perhaps the most remarkable discovery of 2009 was that Blake took an apprentice named Thomas Owen
in 1788 (see illus. 1).<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n1" type="note">1</ref> Scarcely
anything more is known about Owen or his apprenticeship.</p>
          <note id="n1">1. David Alexander, “William Blake, graveur d’interprétation” (see 
<hi rend="i">William Blake [1757-1827]: Le Génie visionnaire du romantisme anglais</hi> under 2009 in Part IV)
80. See also the addenda to <hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2), online.</note>
          <p>The term of the apprenticeship (1788-95) coincides with a period of enormous productivity for
Blake. How much of this fecundity was fostered by the assistance of an apprentice able to take on some of the
drudgery of polishing plates, sharpening gravers, mixing colors, and laying in outlines, not to mention casual
carrying and fetching, which would otherwise have fallen upon Blake and Catherine?</p>
          <p><hi rend="b">Blake’s Writings</hi></p>
          <p>Blake’s letter of 7 August 1804, which disappeared a century and a quarter ago, reappeared in
2009 and, happily for us all, was acquired by Robert N. Essick. Essick will publish a transcription which will
supersede the fragments quoted in catalogues of 1878, 1885, and 2009.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Thel</hi> pl. 7, <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> pls. 7, 11-12, 17, 19, 23, and 
<hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> pl. 16 from Small Book of Designs (B), which were displayed at the Tate in 2007-08,
have now been sold by their still-anonymous owner to the Tate.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Songs</hi> pl. 30 was acquired by Victoria University in the University of
Toronto.</p>
          <p>New printings of Blake’s work (mainly poems from <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>) were discovered in
publications predating Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life</hi>.</p>
          <p><hi rend="b">Commercial Engravings</hi></p>
          <p>Previously unknown works with engravings after Blake’s designs were first recorded in 2009: the
<hi rend="i">Diamond Bible</hi> (1832-34, 1836-37, 1840) with a copy of Blake’s engraving of “Job and His
Family”; <hi rend="i">Diario de los niños</hi>, only the second time designs by Blake were lithographed
(the first was “Enoch” [1807]) and the first printing—by almost a century—of anything concerned with
Blake in Mexico.</p>
          <p><hi rend="b">Catalogues and Bibliographies</hi></p>
          <p>A marvelous new resource is J. R. de J. Jackson, <hi rend="i">Bibliography of Romantic
Poetry</hi> 1770-1835, which is online at the University of Toronto Library
&lt;http://jacksonbibliography.library.utoronto.ca&gt;. Phase 1, which is up and running, presents 17,160
entries for 1798-1835. Phase 2, “in an advanced state of preparation,” will add 5,359 entries for 1770-97.
The Blake entries in phase 1 (<hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>) are derivative, but
the thousands of other entries are de visu and wonderfully useful.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Artcyclopedia</hi> &lt;http://www.artcyclopedia.com&gt; searches by artist’s name
to provide links to images at institutional web sites (e.g., 41 Blake images at the Art Gallery of New South
Wales, Sydney).</p>
          <p>The major discovery of 2009 for me has been <hi rend="i">Google Books</hi>
&lt;http://books.google.com&gt;. Despite all the hype, this is a wonderfully useful resource. Of course I had
heard of it as one of those grandiose cyber-vauntings and its challenge to copyright, but I had no conception
of how far the project has advanced or the sophistication of the means of access. <hi rend="i">Google
Books</hi> has made possible the discovery of scores of previously unreported references to Blake in
publications of 1780-1862, a surprising number of them in French and German.</p>
          <p>The volume accompanying the Blake exhibition at the Petit Palais in Paris is a handsome quarto.
It consists of three streams of information: the first and smallest is the catalogue of the works exhibited,
the second is 31 short essays, and the third is the 173 striking reproductions.</p>
          <p>The essays, mostly by distinguished Blake scholars, are carefully organized to encompass
Blake’s whole career from his apprenticeship to his reputation in England, the United States, and France.
The scholars, like the loaning institutions, are mostly British and French.</p>
          <p>There has been far too little coordination of the text with the reproductions, which are often
scarcely related to the essays. The surprising rewards of the most original of the essays here—those by
David Alexander, Robin Simon, and Jon Stallworthy—are not significantly reinforced by the many
illustrations.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref></p>
          <note id="n2">2. The most important visual feature referred to in the text (96)—the cricket bat in
the second plate of “Pré tintant” (“The Ecchoing Green”)—is not reproduced at all, although there
are many other plates from the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>.</note>

Books 1710-1811 (ref. IR1/33 [pp. 218-19]) in the National Archives.
            <p>The record is in a large folio volume. On the verso of one leaf (above) are the date (Thursday
10 July [17]88), the name of the master (W<hi rend="s">m</hi>. Blake), his parish (St. James’s, Westminster,
County of Middlesex), his trade (engraver), and the name of the apprentice (Tho<hi rend="s">s</hi>. Owen).</p>
            <p>On the recto of the facing leaf (below) are the date on which the apprenticeship began (23 June
[17]88), the length of the apprenticeship (7 years), the fee paid for the apprentice (£52.10.0 or 50
guineas), and the duty paid on the fee (£2.12.6).</p>
            <p>The book is for apprenticeships outside the City of London, where Blake was apprenticed. The
record was first cited by David Alexander (see note 1). The only previous record of a Blake apprentice known
to me is in the fiction by Peter Carter, <hi rend="i">The Gates of Paradise</hi> &lt;<hi rend="i">BBS</hi> p.

          <p>John Windle’s handsome and enormous catalogue 46 ([November] 2009) of books by and about Blake
and his circle is perhaps the largest bookseller’s catalogue ever devoted to Blake. It is valuable to
scholars and critics as well as to hopeful collectors for what it brings to light.</p>
          <p><hi rend="b">Criticism, Biography, and Scholarly Studies</hi></p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Google Books</hi> has made possible the discovery of references to Blake by such
notable contemporaries as Lady Charlotte Bury (1830), Leigh Hunt (1810), and John Landseer (1834).</p>
          <p>Mei-Ying Sung’s <hi rend="i">William Blake and the Art of Engraving</hi> (2009) is rather more
narrowly focused than its title suggests. It concentrates very rewardingly upon Blake’s engraving materials,
his copperplates and woodblocks, particularly their unengraved versos with evidence of repoussage or hammering
the copper to alter a feature of the engraved recto.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n5"
type="note">5</ref> She finds that Blake used repoussage a good deal more than did other engravers, such as
Schiavonetti. “This either means that Blake made many more mistakes in handling his burin than others (and
so was not a very skillful engraver), or that he had a freer attitude towards engraving and did not mind
making mistakes and subsequently correcting or revising them on the copper plate” (57).</p>
          <note id="n5">5. Almost all the evidence is from Blake’s engravings of his own designs; the
copperplates engraved from the designs of others do not survive, except for the Hogarth plate.</note>
          <p>Would she draw similar conclusions about the alterations in Blake’s manuscripts such as his 
<hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> and <hi rend="i">Vala</hi>? Might such alterations not indicate meticulousness in
improving his earlier version?</p>
          <p>Her argument is vitally supported by reproductions, but there are only 8 figures; her
dissertation (2005) with 99 photographs, including recto and verso of all the <hi rend="i">Job</hi> plates, is
far more generous in this respect.</p>

          drawing for it in the same collection is labeled “S. Collings” in a twentieth-century hand, and
the catalogue said<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> that it was
engraved by William Blake for the <hi rend="i">Wit’s Magazine</hi>.</p>
          <note id="n6">6. By May 2010 the online catalogue still attributed the engraving to Blake, but made
no reference to the <hi rend="i">Wit’s Magazine</hi>.</note>
          <p>No such print is recorded in the obvious sources, for the very good reason that it almost
certainly has nothing to do with Blake. He certainly signed six prints in the <hi rend="i">Wit’s
Magazine</hi> (1784), four of them designed by Samuel Collings, and the size of the Italian Puppet Show print
(23.5 × 15.9 cm.) is commensurate with those Blake engraved (c. 23 × 18 cm.). However, no such print appears
in the <hi rend="i">Wit’s Magazine</hi> (Printed for Harrison and Co. N<hi rend="s">o</hi> 18,
Paternoster-Row, 1784-85), and there is no story which would justify its insertion. Furthermore, the firm of
Bowles &amp; Carver was not founded until 1793, when Henry Carington Bowles (1763-1830) took over the business
of his father Carington Bowles (1724-93). The firm flourished from 1793-1830, publishing satirical prints
voluminously,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> but its imprint has not
previously been associated with the <hi rend="i">Wit’s Magazine</hi> or elsewhere, though the speculative
association with Samuel Collings is not implausible.</p>

          <p>I am deeply grateful for various kinds of assistance generously proffered by Sarah Bentley,
Professor Robert Brandeis, Professor Robert N. Essick (for the draft of his “Blake in the Marketplace,
2009” and his essay on etched variants in <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, and for endless patience and
generosity), Professor Heather Jackson (for details of the <hi rend="i">Diamond Bible</hi> in the British
Library), Alan Kahan (for a reproduction of the apprenticeship record of Thomas Owen), Jeffrey Barclay Mertz,
Agnieszka Osińska, Professor Morton D. Paley, Pickering &amp; Chatto, Susanne Sklar, Tate Publishing,
Professor Angus Whitehead, and John Windle.</p>
          <p>Research for this checklist was carried out particularly in the libraries of the University of
Toronto and Victoria University in the University of Toronto, Toronto Public Library, <hi rend="i">Google
Books</hi>, and, for Japanese publications, <hi rend="i">CiNii</hi> (Scholarly and Academic Information
Navigator) online, the National Diet Library online catalogue, and the Komaba Library and the General Library
of the University of Tokyo.</p>
          <p>I have made no systematic attempt to record audio books and magazines, broadcasts on radio and
television, calendars, CD-ROMs, chinaware, coffee mugs, comic books, computer print-outs (unpublished),
conferences, e-mails, festivals and lecture series, furniture, jewelry, lectures on audiocassettes, lipstick,
manuscripts, microforms, mosaics, movies, murals, music, notebooks (blank), pageants, performances, pillows,
playing cards, podcasts, poems about Blake, portraits, postcards, posters, recorded readings and singings,
refrigerator magnets, stained-glass windows, stamps (postage and rubber), stickers, sweatshirts, T-shirts,
tattoos, tiles, typescripts (unpublished), video recordings, and web sites. The most comprehensive source of
frivolities is CafePress &lt;http://www.cafepress.com&gt;.</p>
          <p>The annual checklist of scholarship and discoveries concerning William Blake and his circle

not recorded in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi>, and “William Blake

            <p>This division is organized by individual (say, William Hayley or John Flaxman), with works by
and about Blake’s friends
              <pb id="p44-7" n="7"/>
              and patrons, living individuals with whom he had significant direct and demonstrable contact. It
does not include important contemporaries with whom Blake’s contact was negligible or non-existent, such as
John Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke.</p>
          <p>Reviews, listed here under the book reviewed, are only for works which are substantially about
Blake, not for those with only, say, a chapter on Blake. Note that <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> and 
<hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> do not include reviews.</p>
          <p>I should be most grateful to anyone who can help me to better information about the unseen (§)
items reported here, and I undertake to thank them prettily in person and in print.</p>

          <p>* Works prefixed by an asterisk include one or more illustrations by Blake or depicting him. If
there are more than 19 illustrations, the number is specified. If the illustrations include all those for a
work by Blake, say <hi rend="i">Thel</hi> or his illustrations to <hi rend="i">L’Allegro</hi>, the work is

              <note id="n18">18. A letter of Wednesday 24 Apr. [1811] from “W.B.” declining to buy “the
little picture of the Pope” is reproduced and attributed to the poet in the American Art Association
catalogue of 13-14 Mar. 1928, lot 37 (said to have been sent to Blake’s “old friend John Thomas Smith”).
I am confident that the letter is not by the poet and suspect that it is by William Beckford.</note>

              History: As in <hi rend="i">BB</hi> p. 279 to 1885; thereafter it passed to Robert Griffin (c.
1840-1921) of Court Garden, Marlow, Buckinghamshire, and “thence by descent” to an anonymous owner, for
whom it was sold at Sotheby’s (London), 17 Dec. 2009, lot 72 (partially quoted and reproduced) (estimate
£25,000-£35,000) for £46,850 to John Windle for Robert N. Essick.</p>
              <p>1807 MAY (from R. H. Cromek)<lb/>
              History: See <hi rend="i">BB</hi> p. 280 (simplistic), <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> (1999, 2009). T.
H. Cromek transcribed the letter, extensively normalized, in his manuscript “Memorials” (c. 1865) in
Princeton; the source of the letter is obscure, since R. H. Cromek’s transcription of his original and Allan
Cunningham’s transcription of Cromek’s transcription were not accessible to him. Another copy of the
manuscript “Memorials” made by T. H. Cromek passed to his descendant Wilfred Warrington 
(<hi rend="i">BR</hi>[2] 262fn); presumably this too has a transcription of Cromek’s letter to Blake of the same
authority.<lb/>
              T. H. Cromek’s transcription differs in many minor ways from that in the 
<hi rend="i">Gentleman’s Magazine</hi> (1852) &lt;<hi rend="i">BB</hi> #969&gt;; abbreviations (e.g., “w<hi
rend="s">d</hi>”, “exclus<hi rend="s">y</hi>”) are expanded, layout is altered (e.g., the first
paragraph in the <hi rend="i">Gentleman’s Magazine</hi> is divided into three). I take it that his source
was the <hi rend="i">Gentleman’s Magazine</hi> version and that his version consequently has no
authority.</p>

preparing a palette, reproducing the effects of shadows, bark, etc., signed “W B”, is attributed to the
poet and partly reproduced in the Anderson Galleries auction catalogue of 3 Apr. 1928, lot 13 (see Windle’s
catalogue 46 [under 2009 in Part IV], lot 539). The handwriting is quite unlike that of the poet, and I see no

              <p>T. H. Cromek wrote of the watercolors:
			<q>The original design for the frontispiece, still in my possession, was suppressed, and one
much finer substituted. It is a pen outline, slightly shaded with Indian ink, and blue, &amp; represents a
soul rising from the tomb, on which Blake has written, very neatly, [the] title.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n25" type="note">25</ref></q>
              This is clearly the drawing called by Butlin “A Spirit Rising from the Tomb” (#616, 20.5 ×
24.0 cm., now in the Huntington), on which Blake wrote: “A Series of Designs: Illustrative of The Grave. a
Poem by Robert Blair. Invented &amp; Drawn by William Blake”.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref

              Date: An advertisement in <hi rend="i">Leigh Hunt’s London Journal</hi> for 30 Apr. 1834 (see
below) says that the Diamond Bible was being reissued in monthly numbers with two steel engravings each. Since
it identifies 56 prints (there were eventually 60), this implies that the first number appeared in Jan. 1832
and the last in June 1834, if they were issued regularly. If the prints appeared in the order in which they
are numbered, Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> print was published with the fifteenth monthly number in Mar.
1833.<lb/>
              Plates: There are 60 steel-plate illustrations 11.5 × 6.5 cm. engraved by W. H. Lizars after
great masters. No. 30 is Blake’s “Job and His Family.”<lb/>
              At vol. 1, p. 632 is an engraving with “BLAKE.” at the top, “JOB AND HIS FAMILY.” below
the design within a framing line and, below the framing line: “Lizars sc. | Drawn &amp; Engraved for Allan
Bell &amp; C.<hi rend="s">o</hi> Warwick Square, London, 1833.” Lizars altered the shape of Blake’s 
<hi rend="i">Job</hi> pl. “1” from portrait to landscape, shortening it vertically (replacing sheep at the
bottom with a little foliage) and extending it horizontally (with additional sleeping sheep). The sky at the
right has been altered from black to daylight, with the consequent loss of a star.<lb/>
              This is the first time that any of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Job</hi> plates was copied by another
engraver. Lizars’s engraving is copied in <hi rend="i">The English Version of the Polyglott Bible</hi>
(1836) (see the reproduction in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 38.4 [spring 2005]: 137).<lb/>
              William Home Lizars of Edinburgh subscribed for sets of <hi rend="i">Job</hi> in June 1831 and
Aug. 1832, the latter “for a friend” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>[2] 545, 551, 793, 801, 804).</p>

              <p>The text of Hayley’s ballad of the horse was apparently omitted by Phillips in the proofs,
and Blake, in ignorance of this, made an engraving for it. He discovered his mistake when Phillips happened to
send him in London a proof of “the last sheet” to be forwarded to the printer Joseph Seagrave in
Chichester. In his letter of 4 June 1805, Blake wrote to Hayley: “I write to entreat that you would contrive
so as that my plate may come into the work” (presumably including the text of “The Horse” in the 
<hi rend="i">Ballads</hi>), so that Blake would not have to omit “ten guineas from my next demand on

			<q>Works of extraordinary genius have been often undertaken with a fervid impulse which the artist
considered inspiration, and have been hurried on “day and night,” like Mozart’s Requiem, till exhaustion
of mind and body left the gifted enthusiast a prey to every melancholy feeling and awful foreboding. ... But
the case of that extraordinary artist, the late William Blake, is still more in point. Before undertaking any
work of extraordinary effort he was stimulated by supposed mysterious communications: he thought that he
beheld and conversed with the shades of the mighty dead; he was told what he must paint; and the objects to be
described were placed, as he imagined, in glowing vision before his eyes: his aërial visitants watched the
progress of his work; and his wife, fully believing all her husband’s marvellous stories, viewed him as a
being whose pictorial genius was heavenly inspiration, and who was excited to the exercise of his art, not by
the ordinary inducements of wealth or celebrity, or even by the innate dictates of genius, but by supernatural
messages and suggestions, as inexplicable as the request of Mozart’s mysterious stranger. ... It is most
probably, if the circumstance really happened [to Mozart], and was not a mere hallucination, that it could
have been explained at the time, had sufficient attention been given for that purpose ... such stories should
not be protruded unexplained upon the credulous reader .... (655)</q></p>

with the power of calling up from the dead any individual whose portrait he might be desirous of painting, and
used frequently to point out to his friends the forms of the departed prince and philosopher as being actually
present in his studio. A portion of this enthusiasm is inseparable from an expansive and poetical imagination.

			<q>It is wilder and more picturesque ... to be stark mad and a believer in the “ghosts of

            “The Exhibition embraces specimens of the works of nearly seventy deceased Artists .... Among

pictures, with what Smith, in his Life of Nollekens, tells us of Blake’s colouring.” J. T. Smith, 
<hi rend="i">Nollekens and His Times</hi> (1828) (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>[2] 622), is quoted somewhat approximately.
But of course William Blake never depicted “Dead Game”; the artist here is B[enjamin] Blake.</p>

			<q>the few who live in, and yet out of the world. Such a man, for instance, as old Blake, the
artist, and his wife, whose characters (if mortal portraiture could do them justice) would be among the most
extraordinary and the finest that ever were drawn. Persons who, living in a garret and in an abject poverty,
enjoyed the brightest visions, the brightest pleasures, the most pure and exalted piety. The world might call
them mad, but they might with far more truth have called the world mad.</q>

            Blake was tried at the Chichester quarter sessions in Jan. 1804 for assault (including “putting
in fear”), a common law offense, and for sedition and seduction from allegiance and duty, statutory
offenses. However, only the first, assault, was subject to the jurisdiction of the quarter sessions; the
others were, by statute, subject to trial only at the higher court of assizes. The only other trials for
sedition at the time (“damn and bugger the bloody King”) were at the assizes and resulted in three
convictions (three months’ imprisonment for two, one unknown) and one case abandoned for lack of
witnesses.</p>

            “As the mystical and no less gifted artist Blake made a microscopic drawing of a flea, and
thereunto a calculation of what would be its powers of mischief if it were as big as a horse, so we may all
bless our stars that Punch, who seems of the family of Brobdignags, was thus thwarted of his germinant
proportions” (113). “I showed this essay to my friend Mr. Hazlitt [d. 1830] some time since,” who
commented on it (114).<lb/>

			<q>Michael Angelo made the original sketch, or design, from which the work before us was
painted—we doubt whether he could have seen and approved of the figure before us, which has been quoted, we
believe, and rendered more perspicuous and credible, by Flaxman and by Blake. (51)</q>
            Robert Essick suggests to me that the Blake design Landseer had in mind is the plummeting angelic
trumpeter on the title page for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (1808) and wonders whether Blake had been
influenced by Michael Angelo’s drawing.</p>

			<q>Blake (who illustrated Blair’s Grave, and Young’s Night Thoughts) believed in the entity of
the personages created by his morbid mind, and which he conjured up with a magician’s power; he is said to
have been very angry if disturbed while sketching his <hi rend="i">ideal</hi> sitters, among whom were Moses,
Aaron, Christ, St Paul, and many of the worthies of olden time. In the heads of [Dr.] Johnson and Blake the
organ of Marvellousness was very large. (641)</q></p>

more pathetic ... the production of such pieces at all is little short of miraculous. It is not art, but

            A long, intensely admiring account of Blake, paraphrased (with acknowledgements) from Cunningham,
though the praise is largely Romey’s: Blake was “d’une étonnante imagination, d’un talent plein de
magie, l’un des artistes les plus originaux de cette Angleterre ....”<lb/>
            He adds to Cunningham’s account that Blake’s father hired “les maîtres de calcul,
d’arithmétique et de tenue de livres” (bookkeeping); that many clients of Basire preferred the work of
the apprentice to that of the master; that [<hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> (1783)] includes “odes ...
et sonnets” and that Flaxman counseled its publication “à 30 ans” (Blake was 30 in 1787); that Blake
finished his apprenticeship in a little less than seven years (neither Cunningham nor anyone else says exactly
when it finished). To Cunningham’s much quoted account of Blake’s courtship (¶9), he adds: “a vague
restlessness followed him everywhere, in his studio, his happy retreat, where he forgot his troubles so
sweetly, and on his walks, which were his sweetest recreation.” Romey says that Catherine was of very humble
birth and of great beauty (Cunningham says little more than that she had white hands, bright eyes, “and a
slim and handsome shape” [¶9]). Of the sketch of Catherine which Blake made on his deathbed, Cunningham
says no more than that it was “a fine likeness” (¶48), but Romey says it is “remarkable for its
expression of a naive and melancholy head strongly depicted, of a woman still beautiful, in spite of her age,
a strong air of youth.” I take these biographical additions to be Romey’s embroideries of Cunningham, as
Cunningham had in turn embroidered J. T. Smith. His account concludes: “The glory of Blake is not yet come
to France; we will be happy if this article persuades our artists to look for the works of this original
genius. Art would thus surely gain.”<lb/>
            Romey also says that a French translation of Cunningham will be published (it wasn’t). He states
that the French national collection of prints has nothing by Blake, but, through a friend who lives in London,
he acquired with great difficulty an almost complete collection of Blake’s curious productions. His account
names only the works cited by Cunningham: <hi rend="i">America</hi> and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> 
(“<hi rend="i">Les prophéties sur l’avenir de l’Europe et de l’Amérique</hi>”), <hi rend="i">The Gates of
Paradise</hi>, <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> (with 65
plates), <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>, <hi rend="i">Job</hi>, illustrations of Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>
(“<hi rend="i">Les illustrations du tombeau de Blair</hi>”), Canterbury Pilgrims, and Young’s 
<hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> published by Edwards. None of these writings by Blake—or indeed any other—has
been traced to a French nineteenth-century collection. If Romey really owned them, he didn’t notice that 
<hi rend="i">Songs</hi> has 54 plates, not 65, and that <hi rend="i">America</hi> and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> are
not prophecies in the sense of predicting the future.<lb/>
