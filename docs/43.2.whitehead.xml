Smith</title>
            </head>

			<p>G. E. BENTLEY, Jr.’s, <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> (2004) includes four
			references to William Blake in the letters of the poet,
			novelist, and former associate of William Hayley, Charlotte
			Smith.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n61" type="note">1</ref> The earliest allusion
appears in a letter from Smith to
			the attorney Samuel Rose, dated 9 February 1803. She writes:
			<q>My present purpose is, to enquire, whether there is not an
			ingenious Engraver, who executed certain plates for a small
			work of M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Hayley’s relating to Animals—I know not what it
			is as I have never seen it.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n62" type="note">2</ref></q>
			Smith is referring to <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads, Written by
			William Hayley</hi>. The work comprises four ballads by Hayley
			(“The Elephant,” “The Eagle,” “The Lion,” “The Dog”) and
			fourteen plates engraved by Blake (twelve of which were designed
			by him), published in monthly installments between
			June and September 1802. According to Hayley, the ballads
			were “vehicles contrived to exhibit the diversified talents of
			my Friend [Blake] for original design, and delicate engraving.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n63" type="note">3</ref>
			Commenting on the 1803 letter, Bentley observes that
			Smith “clearly knew little of Blake or of his <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series
			of Ballads</hi> (1802), but she had doubtless heard of the book at
			least from some of her old Sussex friends.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n64"
type="note">4</ref> As we shall see,
			she may have learned of the publication from a more intimate
			source.</p>
			<p>Eighteen months later, on 10 September 1804, Smith refers
			to Blake and <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads</hi> in a letter to Rose’s
			wife, Sarah, part of which is quoted in <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n65" type="note">5</ref> She
			continues:
			<q>I wishd to have seen that number of his fables—or whatever
			they are calld which told some extraordinary <hi rend="u">feats</hi> perform’d
			by a certain Eagle who carried away a child &amp; then served as
			Monture [mount] to the Mamma—because a remark of M<hi rend="s">rs</hi>
			Sargents amused me extremely; when having read this fable,
			she said, “Dear M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Hayley, how <hi rend="u">could</hi> you think of telling
			such a thing—really you <hi rend="u">do love</hi> to put Women in the <hi rend="u">most
			extraordinary situations</hi>!”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n66"
type="note">6</ref></q>
			Smith’s anecdote indicates that by September 1804 she had
			not seen the second issue featuring Blake’s frontispiece and
			two illustrations to “The Eagle.”</p>

			Commercial Book Illustrations</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991) 82.</note>

			<note id="n66">6. Judith Phillips Stanton, ed., <hi rend="i">The Collected Letters of Charlotte Smith</hi>
			(Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2003) 662.</note>
			<p>Judith Phillips Stanton’s recent edition of the collected letters
			of Smith contains a fifth, earlier, reference to Blake. At
			the end of a letter to her publishers, Thomas Cadell, Jr., and
			William Davies, dated 16 December 1802, almost two months
			before her letter to Samuel Rose, Smith wrote from Frant,
			Tunbridge Wells:
			<q>M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Hayley informd my daughter some time since that he
			would order his last publication about animals (the title I forget)
			to be left at Y<hi rend="s">r</hi> Shop for her perusal to be returnd for the
			profit of the person who made the drawings. If it is there, be
			so good as to let me know.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n67" type="note">7</ref></q>
			The reference indicates that through communication with
			one of her three surviving daughters, Charlotte Mary Smith,
			Lucy Eleanor Newhouse, or Harriet Amelia Smith, sometime
			between June and mid-December 1802, Charlotte Smith had
			learned something of Blake as the engraver who illustrated
			Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads</hi> and as the intended
			recipient of royalties for that work.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n68"
type="note">8</ref> However, the four later
			references to Blake in Smith’s letters of 1803-06 suggest that if
			her daughter did borrow a copy from Cadell and Davies about
			the end of 1802, Smith did not see it.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n69"
type="note">9</ref></p>
			<note id="n67">7. Stanton 503. Smith’s reference to “[Hayley’s] last publication about
			animals” suggests that she is referring to all four ballads published by September
			1802.</note>
			<note id="n68">8. Smith’s reference to Hayley’s request that her daughter return the
			work to Cadell and Davies “for the profit of the person who made the
			drawings” appears to confirm Hayley’s recollection included in the manuscript
			of his <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi> that the ballads were “printed for the emolument of
			the interesting artist, who had settled in a Cottage, as the Poets Neighbour”
			(<hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2) 116).</note>
			<note id="n69">9. If Smith ever did examine a copy of <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads</hi>, she
			did not do so before September 1804. However, she may have seen copies
			of <hi rend="i">Designs to a Series of Ballads</hi> or <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805) sometime before
March
			1806, although Bentley thinks it unlikely. See <hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2) 224-25.</note>
