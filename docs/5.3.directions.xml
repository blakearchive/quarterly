                    <p>Two films, both produced and directed by Aram Boyajian, were shown 16 and 23 January on
ABC-TV’s <hi rend="i">Directions.</hi> Allen Ginsberg sings and reads from Blake’s works in illuminated
printing as plates from those works are shown. A facsimile was used in the preparation of the films for shots
of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> only; otherwise the photography is of originals.</p>
                    <p>The subject of the first film, <hi rend="i">William Blake: Innocence and
Experience</hi>, is <hi rend="i">There is No Natural Religion</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi> Ginsberg
talks about the influence Blake has had on his own poetry, sings “Ah! Sun-Flower”, and reads several other
songs. Besides plates from the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, there are shots of Westminster Abbey and of the
high-rise building now on the site of Blake’s birthplace. <hi rend="i">William Blake: Prophet</hi>, the
second film, includes shots of the cottage at Felpham. Ginsberg talks on camera about the feeling of “going
mad” when he heard a voice speaking Blake’s poems, and he sings “The Sick Rose.” He reads as selected
pictures from <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen, Milton, Jerusalem</hi>, the watercolor Job series, and the
Dante series are shown.</p>
