                    <p>Warren Howell of John Howell-Books, San Francisco, writes that his firm recently
secured copy P of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> for a private collector in the East. The Howell firm paid
£12,000 for the copy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Howell also says that copy C of <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> (see the last issue of the
<hi rend="i">Newsletter</hi> [#15], pp. 69-70) was sold at Sotheby’s on 29 March 1971 for £24,000 (£27,000
according to <hi rend="i">The Times</hi>: see “British Blake News” below). The Howell firm was the
underbidder. <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> sold for £3800 to John Fleming of New York on behalf of The
Pierpont Morgan Library.</p>
                    <p>On June 15 the Blake-Varley Sketchbook was broken and sold page by page at
Christie’s, with “Ghost of a Flea” most likely to win high-price honors. The drawings seem to have sold at
about the prices expected. Robert Essick bought the “Head of the Dying King Harold Pierced by an Arrow” for
$4065.60. Zeitlin &amp; Ver Brugge bought the standing archer.</p>
                    <p>On June 24 Sotheby’s sold the pencil, sepia, and watercolor preliminary drawing for
“Joseph Ordering Simeon to Be Bound” (in the Fitzwilliam Museum). The drawing was formerly in the possession
of Mrs. B. Clarke. It measures 13 1/4 × 19 inches and is reproduced in the sale catalogue. The sale price of
the drawing was $6720, considerably below the estimates.</p>
                    <p>Our thanks to Robert Essick for the last two items.
