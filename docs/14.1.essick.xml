        <p>Since my last survey of sales (<hi rend="i">Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly</hi>, Vol.
          12, Summer 1978, pp. 26-38), it has become increasingly clear that there is no single
          Blake market, amenable to easy summary, but several. Eash has its own distinct economics,
          group of buyers and sellers, and importance for academic Blakeans.</p>
        <p>The stratospheric heights, beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest, have been
          represented during the last two years by the auction sale of <hi rend="i">Songs of
            Innocence and of Experience</hi> copy D (illus. 1) and the two large tempera panels,
          “Evening” and “Winter.” The first, knocked down for $147,000 (plus the 10% surcharge now
          required by both Sotheby’s and Christie’s), not only is a record for any work by Blake,
          but according to Christie’s is the most ever paid for a single work of English literature.
          Unfortunately (for the sellers) the several other illuminated books sold in 1978 and 1979
          changed hands before this landmark auction. It should have considerable impact on future
          sales of fine illuminated books, few of which still lie in private hands; but less
          influence on prices for individual relief etchings and I suspect practically none on other
          types of Blake books. The high prices for the temperas (£30,000 for “Winter” and £21,000
          for “Evening”) were at least in part due to the medium, generally considered by the art
          world to be, like oil, more important than water color. That Blake’s so-called “temperas”
          were probably executed in nothing more than a thicker variety of Blake’s gum- or
          glue-fixed water color makes little difference in this context. The price for “Winter” is
          probably a new auction record for a painting by Blake and will tend to push up the
          monetary value of his other important pictures. Yet, if we compare this price to those
          fetched by even the second rank of old masters or important eighteenth-century continental
          artists, Blake looks like a bargain. His drawings and paintings still find their market
          among rather bookish sorts or collectors who concentrate on British art and have little
          appeal outside the English speaking world. If Blake should ever become part of the
          international art market and achieve the popularity and reputation of such masters as
          Frederick Remington or Andy Warhol, prices would soar.</p>
        <p>The scene is very different if we look at the other end of the Blake picture market. The
          drawing “Non Angli Sed Angeli” did fairly well at £2200, at least in part because it is
          closely associated with the important finished water color in the Victoria and Albert. Yet
          prices for equally important drawings have actually descended—precipitously so if
          calculated in uninflated money. A case in point is “Every Man also Gave Him a Piece of
          Money” (illus. 2) formerly in the Robertson and Preston collections. Colnaghi offered it
          for £15,000 in their fall 1976 exhibition, but the drawing was stolen on the last day of
          the show. Recovered by the insurance company, the drawing was offered at Sotheby’s with an
          estimate of £10,000 to £15,000. The drawing’s lot number is not given in the price list,
          and thus it apparently failed to meet the reserve, which could not have been higher than
          the low estimate. Dealers continue to ask high prices for such works, but the auction
          record shows the true thinness and weakness of this market. Lesser works have fared even
          worse. <pb id="p14-5" n="5"/>
After the high prices fetched in June 1971 for leaves from
          the Blake-Varley Sketchbook, seven years later one would think that even a counterproof
          would bring more than the £45 paid for “Queen Eleanor.” A similar counterproof of “Canute”
          went for £150 in 1976.</p>
        <p>Impressions of Blake’s intaglio engravings have fluctuated considerably, in part
          according to availability. Commercial engravings plucked from books have risen sharply,
          but their price was so low only a few years ago that 100% increases do not carry them very
          far in absolute terms. “Christ Trampling on Urizen” demonstrates the effects of
          over-supply. There would seem to be a cache of posthumous impressions somewhere, but its
          owner has not been releasing them slowly enough and the auction prices have steadily
          descended. One of the first to appear on the auction market in many years brought £189 in
          October 1975; the most recent sold for £15 in February 1979. Even major series such as the
          Job and Dante illustrations have not increased much on the average, and one can pick out
          individual sales that show a decline. For example, in July 1974 a complete set of the
          Dante made £3,700 in London; another copy of the 1892 printing, with a bit more foxing,
          brought £3200 in December 1979. A complete proof copy of the Job sold at a London auction
          in December 1973 for £3200; a similar set brought $5000 in a New York sale, May 1978. The
          Job—one of the greatest works of line engraving produced in any age—is my candidate for
          the most underpriced work by an English artist. If the market gave it a monetary value
          commensurate with its aesthetic value, as it does for Durer, Rembrandt, and Goya, the
          price should be in the neighborhood of $20,000.</p>
        <p>The Blake book market, excluding original copies of the illuminated books, is more
          orderly than those already described. A few items, such as the <hi rend="i">Wit’s
            Magazine</hi>, suddenly take off for no apparent reason, but gradual rises are the rule.
          Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of Blake</hi>, 1863 and 1880, and almost all titles by Sir
          Geoffrey Keynes, have more than outpaced the general rate of inflation. The best
          performers among books with Blake’s engravings have been the <hi rend="i">Night
            Thoughts</hi>—including the enormous record price of $18,150 for a beautifully colored
          copy—and titles that have always brought good prices, such as Hunter’s 
            <hi rend="i">Narrative</hi> and Stuart &amp; Revett’s <hi rend="i">Antiquities of Athens</hi>,
for
          reasons other than their Blake associations. Quaritch has made certain that the prices for
          out-of-print Blake Trust items continue their steady ascent by purchasing copies that come
          up at auction and offering them for sale at prices a little above the rest of the market.
          Their price of $4000 for the 1951 <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> is a new record for any
          Blake Trust volume. Important early reprints of Blake’s poems, particularly those
          published by Pickering, have fared well. Yet, there is nothing in the record of sales to
          support the common opinion, held by many dealers as well as collectors, that any book
          bearing Blake’s name automatically soars in price above all other publications.</p>
        <p>The following compilation of Blake sales for 1978-1979 (along with a few late 1977 and
          early 1980 items) follows the same format as previous lists, with the addition of a
          concluding section on selected out-of-print secondary materials. We hope that this new
          section will help individuals and libraries determine appropriate prices for volumes they
          wish to add to their research and reference collections.</p>

            copy of the poems with the illuminations colored in a very Blakean manner, as he calls
            it, must have been Blake himself.</p>

            hand colored ($3000). This is a very beautiful, although little known, facsimile in its
            hand colored state. The Publisher’s Note states that “the colouring and gilding have
            been done by Mr. Samuel Hurd, of London, who worked from Blake’s original in the British
            Museum. Mr. Hurd promised to colour 100 copies, but the work proved to be so much more
            arduous than he had anticipated or could endure, that he felt compelled to call a
            permanent halt when, after a struggle lasting eight and a half years, he had finished,
            to his own satisfaction and ours, 51 copies.” The facsimile is based on copy T.</p>
