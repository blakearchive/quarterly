          <p>Aethelred and Alexandra Eldridge of Golgonooza, Primal Church of the Blake Revival, The Spiritual
Fourfold London; In America; Near the Ohio; At the foot of Mount Nebo—the asylum for the redemption of
Art—sent us a couple of packages recently, with this note:
<q>
We have begun work on a large half-timber building, a Scriptorium on the grounds of Golgonooza: Church &amp;
School of Wm. Blake. This will house a bindery and printery for the production of original works inspired by
Wm. Blake.<lb/>
Ten volunteers have spent months gathering stone and tearing down a 3-story barn for use of its beams &amp;
boards. The foundation has at last been started. All the hand labour has thus far been voluntary. But building
materials are expensive. We are in great need of contributions, no matter how small. Being a non-profit
organization, all gifts will be tax deductible. We “labour incessant . . . . Creating the beautiful House . .
. ,” renewing the lost Arts of the ancients.<lb/>
