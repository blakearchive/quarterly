          <p>It is difficult to make any completely false generalization about the Blake market in 1974 and
1975. Prices were up; prices were down. It was a good market for buyers (of certain types of materials); it
was a good market for sellers (of other types of materials). New record prices were set, while important works
failed to find buyers even at moderate prices. It was the worst of times; it was the best of times. A
combination of economic difficulties, particularly in Britain, and a strong book and print market over the
last ten years drove a number of medium-priced items out of hiding. In his 1921 <hi rend="i">Bibliography of
William Blake</hi>, Geoffrey Keynes noted that the third edition of Erasmus Darwin’s <hi rend="i">Botanic
Garden</hi> (1795) was “considerably scarcer than the other two.” In the last two years, no fewer than ten
copies of this edition appeared on the market, three more than the first edition and eight more than the
second. In the 1920s, the <hi rend="i">Botanic Garden</hi> was not traded primarily as a Blake item. But now
it is, and thus the third edition, containing an additional plate by Blake after Fuseli, is more valuable than
the earlier editions. The third was never any rarer, in absolute terms, than the others, but the market made
it seem that way until dealers began to ferret out what is now the most profitable edition. A similar deluge
of etchings by Samuel Palmer rumbled through the auction and print dealers’ catalogues. In the face of all
this activity, book and print prices did not continue to accelerate quite as rapidly as in previous years, but
no significant backsliding occurred. Collectors who were willing to meet the market prices had many
opportunities to expand their holdings, particularly of books with Blake’s commercial engravings, but true
bargains were scarcer than ever. Book and print prices rarely fall dramatically, in part because the inner
circle of larger dealers is able to keep auction prices up and hold items for long periods without cutting the
retail price.</p>
          <p>The most expensive works are more subject to pressures growing from the condition of the general
economy. On 21 March 1974, the “Preston” colored proof of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl. 41 brought £13,000
at a Sotheby’s auction—no doubt a world record for a single leaf from one of Blake’s illuminated books.
The other end of the market was reached on 28 November 1974 in the same rooms, when two of Blake’s 1795
color printed drawings (illus. 1, 2) failed to attract serious bidders and were bought-in far below the
minimum estimates. Both “Pity” and “Lamech
<pb id="p10-54" n="54"/>
                        and his Two Wives” had unfairly acquired reputations as little better than ruins,
partly through comparison with the magnificent Butts copies in the Tate, but that any work executed in one of
Blake’s most interesting techniques should be ignored by major dealers and collectors is surprising. In the
past, Blake’s drawings regularly sold at auction for as much as twice the estimate, but we can no longer
assume that this will happen without fail. “War Unchained” failed to meet the reserve at Christie’s on 17
June 1975, and “Theotormon Woven” sold for only £20 over estimate at Sotheby’s on 27 November 1975. The
drawings market will probably continue to bounce about over the next few years, but high reserves and the
stabilizing maneuvers of the major dealers will prevent the small collector from picking up important works at
bargain prices.</p>
          <p>The following list of 1974-75 Blake sales, arranged by item (rather than sale) and divided into
four parts, includes only original materials by Blake and unique works directly concerned with him. The final
section covers sales of works by artists in Blake’s circle. I have not included late works by people such as
Linnell and Richmond which have little connection with Blake’s own styles and interests. Dealers’
catalogues are listed following all auction sales of each item. In many cases, there is no longer much
difference between the dealers’ “retail” prices and the “wholesale” auction prices. In the 1972-73 survey in
<hi rend="i">Newsletter 27</hi>, pp. 52-59, I included many secondary works and modern facsimiles. Such
inclusiveness would have

	<figTranscr/>
	<head>2 “Pity.”</head>
	<figDesc>Color printed drawing, 1795. Collection of Colin Franklin.</figDesc>
</figure>
tripled the length of the present survey. On the whole, prices for these materials have risen since the
1972-73 period about 5 to 10% more than the general rate of inflation. The only noticeable exceptions to this
rule of thumb are the most sought-after Blake Trust facsimiles now out of print.</p>
          <p>I have made no attempt to search out every minor auction catalogue or dealer’s list for
inclusion here. All Sotheby, Sotheby Parke-Bernet, and Christie’s sales have been covered, as have the
catalogues of the major book dealers and art galleries who regularly deal in original Blake materials. I would
very much appreciate <hi rend="i">Newsletter</hi> readers informing me of any sales, particularly from obscure
corners, during 1976 and 1977.</p>

	<note id="n27"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Sotheby’s and Christie’s use a simple code in their catalogues to
indicate how certain they are of their attributions. The full name of an artist (thus, “William Blake”) means
that the auction house believes that the work in question is by the artist. The initials of the forename (s)
and the surname (W. Blake) means that the work is of the period of the artist, in his style, and may be wholly
or in part his work. The surname only (Blake) means that the work is in the artist’s style and may be of his
period or later.</note></p>
