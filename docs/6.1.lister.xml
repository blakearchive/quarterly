                    <p>The leaves are all stabbed for sewing, and this applies to no other similar copies in
the Keynes and Wolf <hi rend="i">Census.</hi> No copy seems to lack these particular plates. It therefore
would appear that this is from an unrecorded copy. In no other copies are plates [18, 25] [24, 27] or [19, 54]
printed back to back.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n39" type="note">2</ref>
