	<meta name="DC.Description" xml:lang="en" content="  In the past decade, we have seen examinations of the more marginal works (sometimes literally so) in William Blake&amp;rsquo;s oeuvre. For example, Blake&amp;rsquo;s epic  Jerusalem  has long been considered more or less his valedictory work, but in 2003&amp;rsquo;s  The Traveller in the Evening: The Last Works of William Blake  (Oxford), Morton Paley charted Blake&amp;rsquo;s productions after that supposed farewell, and in the process created a valuable introduction for readers interested in examining those relatively neglected materials.&amp;nbsp; In 2009 Hazard Adams offered a similar overview of Blake&amp;rsquo;s marginalia in  Blake&amp;rsquo;s Margins: An Interpretive Study of the Annotations  (McFarland).&amp;nbsp; In  William Blake on His Poetry and Painting: A Study of  A Descriptive Catalogue , Other Prose Writings and  Jerusalem, Adams &amp;ldquo;continues the study of William Blake&amp;rsquo;s prose writings begun with  Blake&amp;rsquo;s Margins &amp;rdquo; (1).&amp;nbsp;  Poetry and Painting  looks at Blake&amp;rsquo;s prose works with a particular focus on his remarks on art and poetry. Part I includes seven essays on, respectively,  A Descriptive Catalogue ,  A Vision of the Last Judgment ,  A Public Address ,  On Homers Poetry  and  On Virgil ,  Laoco&amp;ouml;n , Blake&amp;rsquo;s letters, and &amp;ldquo;The Early Tractates.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; Part II comprises three essays, the first considering Blake&amp;rsquo;s attitudes on poetry, on his own poetry, and on other poets, the second on his prose and  Jerusalem , and the third on his impact on William Butler Yeats and James Joyce.

<p class="byline">Reviewed by R. Paul Yoder</p>
<p class="note"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">R. Paul Yoder</span> (<a href="mailto:rpyoder@ualr.edu">rpyoder@ualr.edu</a>)
 is a professor of English at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.
 He is the author of articles on Milton, Alexander Pope, Samuel 
Richardson, Thomas Gray, Blake, and Wordsworth.  His book, <em>The Narrative Structure of William Blake’s Poem</em> Jerusalem: <em>A Revisionist Interpretation</em>, was published by the Edwin Mellen Press in 2010.  He has also co-edited, with Wallace Jackson, two essay collections on Pope.</p>
</div>
<div class="text">
<p>In the past decade, we have seen examinations of the more marginal works
(sometimes literally so) in William Blake’s oeuvre. For example, Blake’s
epic <em>Jerusalem</em> has long been considered more or less his valedictory
work, but in 2003’s <em>The Traveller in the Evening: The Last Works of William
Blake</em> (Oxford), Morton Paley charted Blake’s productions after that supposed
farewell, and in the process created a valuable introduction for readers interested
in examining those relatively neglected materials.&nbsp; In 2009 Hazard Adams offered
a similar overview of Blake’s marginalia in <em>Blake’s Margins: An Interpretive
Study of the Annotations</em> (McFarland).&nbsp; In <em>William Blake on His Poetry and Painting:
A Study of </em>A Descriptive Catalogue<em>, Other Prose Writings and </em>Jerusalem, Adams
“continues the study of William Blake’s prose writings begun with <em>Blake’s
Margins</em>” (1).&nbsp; <em>Poetry and Painting</em> looks at Blake’s prose works
with a particular focus on his remarks on art and poetry. Part I includes seven essays on, respectively, <em>A Descriptive
Catalogue</em>, <em>A Vision of the Last Judgment</em>, <em>A Public Address</em>, <em>On
Homers Poetry</em> and <em>On Virgil</em>, <em>Laocoön</em>, Blake’s letters,
and “The Early Tractates.”&nbsp; Part II comprises three essays, the first considering
Blake’s attitudes on poetry, on his own poetry, and on other poets, the second
on his prose and <em>Jerusalem</em>, and the third on his impact on William
Butler Yeats and James Joyce.&nbsp; There is some repetition of information, especially
among the essays in part I; Adams acknowledges this, saying that “the book is
designed so that readers, particularly students beginning study of Blake and
readers more casually interested in his thought, may conveniently consult a particular
chapter on a particular work” (1).&nbsp; The book’s introductory intent is obviously
valuable, but the more than casually interested reader could have wished for
Adams to push a bit harder at these less commonly discussed works.</p>
<p>Most of the works on which Adams focuses were written after Blake’s return
to London in late 1803 from his “three years slumber” at Felpham.&nbsp; That time
in Felpham was an important transitional period in Blake’s life, and that experience
and the years afterward were key to the developments in his thinking that
shaped <em>The Four Zoas</em>, <em>Milton</em>, and <em>Jerusalem</em>.&nbsp; Much
of this material has been covered elsewhere, as in the case of <em>Laocoön</em>,
for example, which has been admirably discussed recently by both Paley in <em>The
Traveller in the Evening</em> and Julia Wright in <em>Blake, Nationalism, and
the Politics of Alienation</em> (Ohio University Press, 2004).&nbsp; What Adams brings to the table is his
own slant based on decades of work on Blake and on literary criticism, especially
his emphasis on Blake’s antithetical method and on the importance of synecdoche
in Blake’s thinking.&nbsp; Moreover, the second essay of part II (“From the Prose
to <em>Jerusalem</em>”) reproduces much of Adams’s important but largely neglected
1993 essay from <em>Studies in Romanticism</em>, while the final essay in the
book (“From <em>Jerusalem</em> and the Prose to Yeats and Joyce”) similarly revisits
earlier essays on those later writers.</p>
<p>Given that Adams intends only an introduction to these prose pieces, 
it is not surprising that there is no overarching thesis to the book.  
Still, two themes run throughout the discussion:<br>
1. Synecdoche is a basic principle for Blake.&nbsp; Adams references his own 1990
essay, “Synecdoche and Method,” from <em>Antithetical Essays in Literary
Criticism and Liberal Education</em> (Florida State University
Press) on this point, and in <em>Poetry and Painting</em> he says, 
“Blake
works almost always by synecdoche” (34) and indeed “thinks by 
synecdoche”
(58).&nbsp; He explains that “the principle of synecdoche expresses for 
Blake
the identity of particular and universal” (52), and he identifies this 
principle
in Blake’s handling of the characters of Chaucer’s Canterbury pilgrims, 
especially the Franklin (“[composed] of all Franklins” [26]),
Blake’s use of “Britain as a microcosm of the world’s history” (40) in 
the painting of <em>The Ancient Britons</em>, and Blake’s understanding of the Last Judgment (“the individual’s Last Judgment is a microcosm
of the world’s” [51]).<br>
2.&nbsp; Many of the ideas expressed in the prose works that Adams considers are integrally
related to ideas expressed in <em>The Four Zoas</em>, <em>Milton</em>, and <em>Jerusalem</em>.&nbsp;
He notes, for example, that “One thing is certain.&nbsp; In painting <em>The Ancient
Britons</em> and writing and etching <em>Jerusalem</em>, Blake was 
producing
what he thought was patriotic art, a mythological history of Britain … 
antithetical to that of reasoning historians and politicians”
(40).&nbsp; About the picture of the Canterbury pilgrims, Adams suggests
 that
“Blake secretly injects into his picture symbols from his long poems” 
(22), and
he cites Orphea Jane Allen’s chart aligning particular pilgrims with 
Blake’s Zoas as well as particular classical deities. Given his comments
 on Chaucer’s Franklin,
he could easily have added that Blake’s understanding of the pilgrims 
provides
much of the groundwork for the doctrine of “states” so important to <em>Milton</em> and <em>Jerusalem</em>.
In his remarks on <em>A Descriptive Catalogue</em>, Adams compares
Blake’s paintings of <em>Nelson Guiding Leviathan</em>, <em>Pitt Guiding Behemoth</em>,
and the lost <em>Spiritual Form of Napoleon</em> to <em>Jerusalem</em>, in which
“Blake calls Leviathan and Behemoth respectively ‘the War by Sea enormous &amp; the
War / By Land astounding’” (19).&nbsp; Concerning <em>A Public Address</em>, Adams
connects Blake’s criticism of Dryden and Pope as well as his declamatory approach
in the <em>Address</em> with the first preface in <em>Jerusalem</em>, in which
Blake attacks the “‘modern bondage of Rhyming’” and identifies “his own poetry
with oratory” (64-65).&nbsp; Indeed, the connection between Adams’s discussions of
the prose works in part I and the three essays in part II depends on the continuity
and development of Blake’s ideas about art from those prose works into his major
later poetry.&nbsp; Adams stipulates that “in order to observe [Blake’s] views of
his own work and what he was attempting to do, a few ventures into <em>Milton</em> and <em>Jerusalem</em> will
be necessary,” and then goes on to trace connections reaching from Blake’s “first
engraved work, where he identifies the ‘true Man’ with the ‘Poetic Genius,’”
through <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> and the various prose works,
and into the later poems in which “Blake identifies man with imagination and
poetry with naming, implying language itself is in its nature poetic” (101).</p>
<p>Several discussions in <em>Poetry and Painting</em> are especially welcome.&nbsp;
Adams devotes an essay to the two tractates printed together, <em>On Homers Poetry</em> and <em>On
Virgil</em>, which for some reason Paley had neglected in <em>The Traveller in the
Evening</em>.&nbsp; He compares Blake’s comments on unity in <em>On Homers Poetry</em> (“Every
poem must necessarily be a perfect Unity, but why Homers is peculiarly so, I
cannot tell”) to Aristotle’s discussion of unity of plot in <em>Poetics</em> (67-70).&nbsp;
He also notes, “When Blake speaks of Homer, he speaks of the fault of his poetry:
its glorification of war and empire,” adding that as the “greatest of the classical
poets,” Homer “stands, by synecdoche, for all ‘the Poetry of the Heathen Stolen &amp; Perverted
from the Bible not by Chance but by design’” (73).&nbsp; Of both tracts Adams says,
</p><blockquote>the mode of argument is enthymemic, that is, with parts left out, but implied
by the fragment that remains.&nbsp; It also appears that the two conclusions of the
tractates are interchangeable.&nbsp; I believe that both tractates have dramatic shapes
and are deliberate efforts to go beyond the boundaries of abstract argumentation.&nbsp;
It is as if they have plot structures.&nbsp; The form is one of search. (72)</blockquote>
<p>The discussion of the prose inscriptions on three of Blake’s drawings for
Dante’s <em>Commedia</em> is one of the strongest in the book.&nbsp; Adams quotes, for example, Blake’s statement in the lower-right
corner of Dante design 101, “Whatever Book is for Vengeance for Sin &amp; whatever
Book is Against the Forgiveness of Sins is not of the Father but of Satan the
Accuser &amp; Father of Hell [E690],” and then remarks, “The statement stands
at the base of Blake’s beliefs in his late years. Nothing was more fundamental
to his view of Jesus’s gospel” (122).</p>
<p>There are other gems scattered throughout the book.&nbsp;Adams offers a concise
formulation of Blake’s critique of allegory: “The problem with allegory is, as
we have seen, its false particularity” (57).&nbsp; He calls Blake’s discussion of <em>The
Canterbury Tales</em> in <em>A Descriptive Catalogue</em> “arguably the most
important criticism of Chaucer between that of John Dryden, who in his <em>Fables
Ancient and Modern</em> (1700) revived Chaucer’s reputation, which had fallen
in the seventeenth century, and Matthew Arnold’s essay in <em>The Study of Poetry</em>&nbsp;
(1880)” (21). On the “fundamental difference” between Blake and Yeats, he
says,
</p><blockquote>Blake is radically humanistic and is totally devoted to a vision of <em>this</em> world
as potentially apocalyptic through an improvement in mental power and cleansing
of error.&nbsp; Yeats is also humanistic, and his antithetical man opts for such a
vision.&nbsp; But at the same time Yeats concludes that a humanistic apocalypse is,
if not impossible, at most only momentary and mysterious. … Like Blake’s,
Yeats’s view is cyclical, but for Blake Yeats’s vision is only of the fallen
cycle. (171-72)</blockquote>
Concerning Blake’s impact on Joyce, Adams observes,
<blockquote>[Robert] Gleckner accurately observes that Joyce finally departed from Blake,
thinking that Blake’s work finally was blind to “the grubby realities of this
world, [leading] to an ‘idealism’ so absolute that there was no room for the Blooms and
Mollys, the Finnegans and the Earwickers” ….&nbsp; I think, if Gleckner is right,
Joyce was wrong about this, for Blake was never that kind of idealist and his
reality was not an elsewhere. (183)</blockquote>
<p>There are some problems with the book.&nbsp; Compared to Adams’s other work, <em>Poetry
and Painting</em> can be a bit dry.&nbsp; Sometimes the phrasing is not 
quite right.&nbsp;
For example, on the relationship between poetry and prophecy, Adams 
says, “Poetry
is prophecy, not prediction.&nbsp; It is insight into things; its role 
is to reshape
the fallen world, which is a congeries of human error, into an image so 
clear
that error will be seen for what it is and thus annihilated” 
(103).&nbsp; The second
sentence here is certainly correct, but the phrasing of the first
sentence seems backward; better to say, “Prophecy is poetry, not 
prediction.”&nbsp;
Also, the documentation on the longer poems is a bit confusing; the 
references
do not follow the standard format of plate and line number, but instead 
indicate only chapter and plate, without noting particular lines.</p>
<p>These are small points, however.&nbsp; The strength in this book lies in the gathering
together of Adams’s take on Blake’s attitudes toward poetry and painting, and
the relationship of those attitudes to the work of key figures before and after
Blake.</p>
