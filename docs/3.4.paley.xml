                    <p>In an earlier age of scholarship, this book would have been called “Materials Toward a
Biography” of William Blake, or something of that sort. Our tighter-lipped times must be content with 
<hi rend="u">Blake Records.</hi> Anyone who works on Blake will be grateful to Professor Bentley for this
compendious labor, which comprises not only contemporary references and documents, but also four invaluable
appendices: “Early Essays on Blake,” “Blake Residences,” “Blake Accounts,” and “Engravings by and after
Blake.” There is also a superbly comprehensive index. If one puts down <hi rend="u">Blake Records</hi> at last
with a certain feeling of frustration, this is not owing to any dissatisfaction with the book itself; it is,
rather, a reflection of the present state of our knowledge about Blake. If even this enormous, rich, plum
pudding of a book does not solve any of the major biographical problems about Blake, does this mean they will
never be solved at all?</p>
                    <p>This is not at all to say that no important biographical data emerges from 
<hi rend="u">Blake Records.</hi> On the contrary, Professor Bentley has substantially increased our knowledge of
Blake’s life, sometimes by single discoveries, sometimes by the accumulation of detail. The possibility that
Blake’s father was converted to Baptism in about 1769 (pp. 7-8) is certainly a very interesting one, to say
the least. The curious claim of Charles Henry Bellenden Ker that Blake had him arrested for nonpayment for two
drawings must give us all pause. (See pp. 227-228). Does this indicate a hitherto unsuspected aspect of
Blake’s character? But how could a man be arrested for debt as a result of a verbal offer made three years
previously, and why should Ker have ended up paying ten guineas more
<pb id="p03-91" n="91"/>
than he had originally promised? On firmer ground, the detailed exposure of Cromek’s dealing with Blake
leaves no room for doubt that Blake was swindled; previously we have tended to side with Blake on emotional or
intuitive grounds, but <hi rend="u">Blake Records</hi> exposes Cromek’s double-dealing very nicely. The
Blake-Linnell accounts leave a much different impression: here one can see that Linnell was accused unjustly
by Palmer and others. Linnell emerges as a hard-headed man, one who would not scruple to dun a nobleman, for
example; more of an entrepreneur than a Maecenas. But he did not pretend to be Blake’s benefactor (and would
Blake have enjoyed it if he had?), and his dealings with Blake were dignified and straightforward. Frederick
Tatham, it must be said, remains about as understandable as Antonio in <hi rend="u">The Tempest.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>At times in reading <hi rend="u">Blake Records</hi> one feels very close to Blake
indeed, seeing him through the eyes of his contemporaries. Professor Bentley has wisely not interfered with
this feeling of contemporaneity, providing only short, lucid expository links where they are needed. The
result is a sort of do-it-yourself Blake biography kit, which at this stage of Blake studies, is more useful
than - in the absence of new major discoveries - a new biography.</p>
