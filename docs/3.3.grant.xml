                <p>Seminar 23: Methods of Studying the Illustrations of William Blake, will meet Sunday, 28
December from 10:30-11:45 a.m. in the Georgetown Room of the Brown Palace Hotel at the 1969 Meeting of the
Modern Language Association to be held in Denver. As is usual for MLA Seminars, the rubric will include the
following information: Attendance limited to 35. Members wishing to participate should write in advance to
Professor John E. Grant, Discussion Leader for Seminar 23, Department of English, University of Iowa, Iowa
City, Iowa 52240. He will grant requests for admission up to the level of accommodations.</p>
                <p>The subject this year will be the Arlington Court Picture. Mrs. Janet A. Warner of Glendon
College, York University, will make a presentation based on an essay in progress.</p>
                <p>Those who plan to attend are reminded of the chief interpretations of the picture which
have been written by Digby, Keynes, and Miss Raine. Probably a slide of the picture will be shown to
facilitate the discussion. Those not particularly gifted with retentive eidetic imaginations may also wish to
have another reproduction available to them. The largest in color is included as pl xvi in Geoffrey Keynes,
ed., <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, The Masters Series no. 6, Paulton and London, 1965.</p>
