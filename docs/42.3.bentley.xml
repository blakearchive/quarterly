          <p>THE first major work about Blake in the nineteenth century was
                        Gilchrist’s epoch-making <hi rend="i">Life of William Blake,
                            “Pictor Ignotus”</hi> (1863), which introduced Blake to a
                        wide public. The second was <hi rend="i">The Works of William Blake, Poetic,
                            Symbolic, and Critical, Edited with</hi> [296] <hi rend="i">Lithographs
                            of the Illustrated “Prophetic Books,” and a Memoir and
                            Interpretation by Edwin John Ellis and William Butler Yeats in Three
                            Vols.</hi> (London: Bernard Quaritch, 1893). The Ellis and Yeats edition
                        published for the first time both the text and reproductions of the
                        previously unheard-of <hi rend="i">Vala</hi> or <hi rend="i">The Four
                            Zoas</hi>, presented for the first time an analysis of the previously
                        scarcely heard of “Symbolic System” (1:235-420), and provided
                        a previously unattempted “Interpretation and Paraphrased
                        Commentary” on all of Blake’s works (2:3-301). These are major
                        accomplishments.</p>
          <p>The initiative for the work seems to have been largely that of Ellis. The
                        editing was done for love, not money. Yeats wrote in 1904 that he worked on
                        the edition for “4 years and . . . never got anything out of it but a
                        few larger paper copies.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n162"

          <p>As early as 29 April 1891 the antiquarian bookseller and publisher Bernard
                        Quaritch wrote to Ellis about printing three volumes of Blake.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n163" type="note">2</ref> In an undated note, Quaritch wrote
                        about the Blake edition: “500 ordinary issue / 150 large paper / Mr.
                        Griggs to supply paper.” A business memorandum in the Quaritch files
                        records: 
						<q> Ellis’ Blake Nov. 1. 1892 Sent Mr Griggs order to

                            green’s Court<lb/>
 Norman, sent order Nov 29 </q>
And on 29
                        November [1892] Quaritch wrote to Ellis: 
						<q> I have given the order to the
                            printers to deliver small and large copies of your Blake to Mess.<hi

                            paper copies in extra cloth uncut with a gold impression on the front. </q>
	<note id="n163">2. My wife and I went through the files in Quaritch’s
                            on 9 August 1990, and Arthur Freeman gave us permission to quote from
                            them.</note></p>
          <p>An agreeably full description of Quaritch’s publication arrangements
                        is given in a recently discovered letter from Quaritch to Ellis: 
						<q> Decbr.
                            30 1892<lb/>
 Dear Mr. Ellis<lb/>
 I am glad you are tolerably well again
                            and that you have set the binder going to do up your<lb/>
Blake, 3
                            vols.<lb/>
 I am in favor of carrying out an agreement to the letter, and
                            therefore refused to Mr. Yeats to exchange small paper copies for the
                            Large Paper ones, due to you, as per agreement. Excuse me, I also refuse
                            this request to you.<lb/>
 To show you however my sense of indebtedness
                            to you, I shall send you <hi rend="u">beyond</hi> your 30 Large Paper
                                copies<lb/>
<hi rend="u">10 on Small paper.</hi><lb/>
 The very desire
                            of yours to prefer the small paper to the Large Paper copies has set me
                            reflecting about the relative prices of the book in the two states, I
                            shall alter the price of the<lb/>
Large Paper copies<lb/>
(from
                            £6:6.) to £4.14.6<lb/>
This seems the more correct
                            proportion<lb/>
 Besides the 6 copies for the press you stipulated for, I
                            shall send out a few more.<lb/>
 What Art Journal do you recommend?<lb/>
                            Yours, dear Sir,<lb/>
ever truly<lb/>

	<note id="n164">3. The letter was discovered in a copy of Ellis and
                                Yeats which John Windle acquired in Germany in 2006. [Scans of the
                                pages are online at the journal’s web site

          <p>In this list, the first six journals are bracketed, suggesting that they are
                        “the 6 copies for the press you stipulated for.”</p>
          <pb id="p42-110" n="110"/>
          <p>In 1895 Quaritch offered <hi rend="i">The Works of William Blake</hi>, ed. E.
                        J. Ellis and W. B. Yeats (1893) at £3.3.0 and the large-paper format at
                        £4.14.6. He quoted reviews in <hi rend="i">Saturday Review</hi> (4 Feb.
                        1893), <hi rend="i">Times</hi> (19 Jan. 1893), which seems to be based on a
                        flier, and <hi rend="i">Methodist Times</hi> (5 Jan. 1893), which says
                        “we have just seen the proof-sheets.”</p>
          <p>Of the 650 sets printed (150 of them large paper), Quaritch gave 40 to Ellis
                        (30 on large paper), 13 to Linnell, who had made <hi rend="i">Vala</hi>
                        available to Ellis and Yeats, 1 to the British Museum Print Room, at least
                        11 as review copies (though his agreement with Ellis called for only 6), and
                        an unknown number to Yeats. Not counting the sets for Yeats, which may have
                        been included in the 40 to Ellis, Quaritch gave away ten percent of the
                        press run.</p>
