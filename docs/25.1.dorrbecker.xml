            <title>Introduction</title>
          </head>
          <p>In 1979, Thomas L. Minnick introduced a new title for the annual checklists published by 
<hi rend="i">Blake.</hi> And in his prefatory note he announced that the term “circle” was to be interpreted
“very broadly.” When Minnick decided on this change of title, there was certainly no intention to hint at
a hegemony of Blake and/or of Blake scholarship over the so-called members of his circle and the study of
their works. This, of course, remains true with the present report as well. Historically, it would be rather
ludicrous to think of William Blake as the center of gravity, and of artists and writers such as Barry,
Cowper, Flaxman, Fuseli, Godwin, Hayley, Paine, West, or Wollstonecraft as the planets circulating on orbits
prescribed by Blake, as <hi rend="i">his</hi> circumference. Though the title of “Blake and His Circle”
easily lends itself to such a misinterpretation, it should not be seen as propagating a return from the
context-conscious Copernican to a Blake-centered Ptolemaic world-view. Rather, the “circle,” as a mere 
<hi rend="i">façon de parler</hi>, now signifies the strong interest in historical and critical context and the
“contextualization” of both the production and the reception of art and literature that has come to
characterize most modern Blake studies.</p>
          <p>However, from studying these annual reports on recent publications concerned with the group of
poets and artists that (in one way or the other) Blake was associated with, it is evident at first sight that
presently Blake does indeed attract more scholarly attention than any of these eighteenth- and
nineteenth-century contemporaries. In the academic world of the late twentieth century Blake is big business
while the study of, say, Benjamin West, one-time President of the Royal Academy, remains a small, though
hopefully beautiful, affair. Then, one also becomes aware that there is at least one important group that has
some claim to be considered part of Blake’s “circle” which nevertheless is hardly ever represented in
the scholarly and critical literature at all—and therefore hardly ever represented in these checklists.
Blake’s colleagues, the reproductive engravers, have largely remained in the critical limbo to which the
hierarchical ordering of British academic art, the R.A.’s very own canon formation, had relegated them
during Blake’s lifetime.</p>
          <p>Now, <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> is <hi rend="i">An Illustrated Quarterly</hi>, and for the past two
years even the annual checklists have been published in a new and pictorially enhanced format. We started,
modestly enough, with illustrations showing piles of recently published books or the covers of some of the
items listed. This may have been more pleasing to the eye than 30 unillustrated pages, yet no one thought of
it as a particularly intelligent and interesting approach toward the illustration of a critical bibliography.
Therefore, last year’s checklist issue employed the illustrations quite differently. Reproductions from late
eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century engravings were intended to function as an occasionally ironic visual
commentary on the act of reading—reading in Blake’s times, reading twentieth-century Blake criticism, and
reading modern scholarly literature on members of Blake’s “circle.” The illustrations in the present
sequel to “Blake and His Circle” lead, I hope, one step further.</p>
          <p>All the illustrations on the subsequent pages reproduce engravings executed by James Parker. They
are included here as a first installment in what may become a series which will visually compensate the
exclusion of Blake’s fellow-engravers from the canon of artists hitherto deemed worthy of scholarly
investigation. Thus, the illustrations that accompany future issues of the checklist might introduce, for
example, the work of reproductive engravers, both friends and foes to Blake, such as William Angus, Francesco
Bartolozzi, James Basire, William Bromley, Robert Hartley Cromek, Jean Marie Delattre, James Fittler, John
Hall, Moses Haughton, James Heath, Thomas Holloway, James Neagle, Luigi Schiavonetti, William Sharp, Anker
Smith, James Stow, or Isaac Taylor. My choice for the first of these pictorial introductions to a member of
Blake’s “circle” that has scarcely ever received any critical attention is a fairly obvious one. James
Parker was Blake’s fellow-apprentice at Basire’s during the 1770s, he teamed up with Blake in a short-lived
printselling business in 1784, he was still quoted by the painter-poet with a certain measure of (interested)
respect in 1804, and he was employed, late in his rather short life, for engraving many of Flaxman’s Homer
designs for the London editions of 1805, a project in which Blake, too, had his own small share as a
reproductive engraver.</p>
          <p>Except for contributions to <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> (which, I assume, are readily at hand to any
reader of this note), I have tried to supply as many annotations for the entries in parts I and II as
possible. As before, however, I ought to point out that only the bibliographical data here
<pb id="p25-5" n="5"/>
presented have any claims to “objectivity.” That is to say that they have been verified and standardized
to the best of my knowledge, and that there are no intentional omissions of relevant materials. (And I should
be most grateful if readers call my attention to additional publications for future reports.) Most of my brief
annotations are meant to be primarily descriptive rather than critical. And yet occasionally, these short
takes have grown into miniature reviews, and these certainly represent no more than one critic’s response to
what he learned from an all too often very brief examination of the contents of the books and articles he
wished to record. I hope that these critical asides will enhance the usefulness and readability of my report
on the state of the art. At the same time, however, I trust that readers will scrutinize those brief reviews
with the same critical detachment as they would use in studying any of the publications themselves. This may
be no more than a foregone conclusion, and yet it deserves special mention since the format of the checklist
does not allow for a thorough discussion of the criteria behind the reviewer’s personal likes and
dislikes.</p>
          <p>The subdivisions employed in the present issue of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>’s checklists and the
guidelines governing the selection and arrangement of the separate entries are the same as those introduced
with the list for 1988-89 where they were explained in some detail in the introduction (see 
<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 23 [1989-1990]: 120-21). No further explication of the organization of the entries is
called for. This year’s checklist of Blake-related publications, however, covers a considerably longer
period than usual, extending roughly from summer 1989 through February 1991. As might be expected, this has
resulted in yet some further increase in the total number of entries. Sadly, though, such an expansion cannot
be taken as indicative of the improved comprehensiveness of the list. With the exception of a day spent at the
British Library, most of my notes had to be written at, and are based on the books and journals available to
me from, Trier University library or those in my private collection of working materials. These limitations of
the library facilities behind the 1989-91 checklist will explain why a relatively large number of publications
are marked as “not seen,” and why, no doubt, many 1990 publications have as yet been overlooked.</p>
          <p>Furthermore—despite the indulgence of my editors (who kindly agreed to postpone the publication
of the checklist for months), and despite the hundreds of hours I have spent at the library to compile the
present issue of “Blake and His Circle,” I have not been able to thoroughly work through such weekly
publications as the <hi rend="i">Times Literary Supplement</hi> or the <hi rend="i">New York Review of
Books.</hi> If time and other projects permit, I will, however, supply the respective references in next
year’s compilation. It is expected that the latter can be finished for publication in the spring 1992 issue
of <hi rend="i">Blake.</hi> And if the present installment of this ongoing report makes for rather heavy going
on account of its length, the installment for 1992 then ought to be little more than a short supplement to
what is now published in these pages.</p>
          <p>If during the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s Blake scholarship has been dominated by
research concerned with the epic poetry of the post-1799 period, a return of critical interest in Blake’s
lyrics and especially, of course, the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, has gained momentum in more recent years. These
renewed efforts to understand Blake’s lyrics of the late 1780s and early 1790s have often been characterized
by the application of newly forged methodological tools, a process which continues into the period here
covered. New interpretations of word and image in “The Tyger” have prompted no less than five articles
recorded on the subsequent pages, and others of the <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> in
1989-90 were good for almost a dozen additional publications. The <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, however, have never
ceased to attract a fair share of critical attention, and it may be more important to mention here the welcome
increase in research energies devoted to <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> or <hi rend="i">Visions of the
Daughters of Albion</hi> (see #78, 100, 132, 155, 176, 184, 195, and 196).</p>
          <p>Whereas studies of the Continental prophecies, <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, and even 
<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> are represented rather scantily this year, <hi rend="i">Vala, or The Four Zoas</hi>
has prompted a couple of new textual studies in 1989 and 1990 (see #41, 57, 63, 161, and 170). The same period
saw the publication of some particularly fine and important catalogues of Blake’s art, documenting both some
major exhibitions and the permanent collections of the Tate Gallery and at Melbourne. Otherwise, art
historians have unfortunately contributed very little to a critical understanding of form and content in
Blake’s imagery. Nevertheless, readers will witness that a thorough revision of the traditional approach
towards the interpretation of Blake’s Dante water colors is now under way, driven by the inquisitiveness of
literary scholars (see especially #47 and 186, as well as #20, 62, 70, 85, and 149). In the future this will,
I believe, not leave the study of Blake’s other series of water color illustrations to the Bible, to Gray,
Milton, or Young unaffected.</p>
          <p>The history of science and of eighteenth-century philosophy supply the backdrop for studies of
Blake’s thought by Ackland, Steve Clark, Doskow, the Olsons, or Peterfreund in another distinct group in
this year’s checklist (see #38, 72, 80, 151, 152, and 157). These articles highlight aspects of Blake’s
critique of the Enlightenment. It seems to be similarly important, however, that at least two other studies
offer renewed investigations into some darker realm. Though very different in their approach and findings,
both Cooper and Youngquist readdress the challenging problems that are posed by what some of Blake’s
contemporaries and Victorian biographers have described as his “madness”
<pb id="p25-6" n="6"/>
(see #74, 203, and 204). Especially if seen together, a new picture of Blake’s creative processes emerges
from these recent reexaminations of their intellectual foundations; not necessarily a clearer picture, but one
that may be closer to the complexities of Blake’s reality, torn between the forces of Los and Urizen.</p>
          <p>Finally, the advent of yet another discipline in the expanding field of Blake studies is now to
be expected. Donald Fitch’s impressive bibliography (#26) offers all the information needed for a steady
increase of Blake-related studies by historians of music. A first step in this direction has already been
taken in a dissertation concerned with Ralph Vaughan Williams’ “Job, A Masque for Dancing” (see
#198).</p>
          <p>Three scholars who have exercised an eminent, and in one case a paramount, influence over our
understanding of Blake’s works (as well as far beyond), are represented in this year’s checklist with new
collections of their essays. The late Northrop Frye’s <hi rend="i">Myth and Metaphor</hi>, Hazard Adams’s
<hi rend="i">Antithetical Essays in Literary Criticism and Liberal Education</hi>, and Jean Hagstrum’s 
<hi rend="i">Eros and Vision</hi> all bear witness to the central position that the study of Blake’s works now
holds in shaping innovative critical theories during the second half of the twentieth century (see #39, 97,
and 106). Frye’s towering presence in the discipline has been made the subject of numerous articles and a
number of books during the past decade; the “Miscellany” in part II, below, adds to the record of such
metacritical studies (see #329, 337, 338, and 343), and it demonstrates that the critic, just as the author or
artist, can supply all that is needed for a biography, for an impressive achievement in the field of
bibliography, and for launching a journal devoted to his work (see #314, 322, and 323). Compared to the extent
of methodological interest in Frye’s thinking, the studies of the work of some other Blake scholars and
enthusiasts such as Arnold Kettle, Jack Lindsay, or Kaethe Wolf-Gumpold do not weigh heavily at all (see #321,
331, and 342).</p>
          <p>In closing, let me say that my sincere thanks are due to those publishing houses in the United
States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands that have supplied me with copies of their recent
Blake-related publications; they have thus enabled me to report in greater detail on a number of books which
otherwise would not have been available to me at Trier. The following friends and colleagues have also greatly
facilitated my work by answering my enquiries and/or by sending offprints from their recently published
articles and reviews, which, once again, has proved to be most helpful: Kiyoshi Ando; A. A. Ansari; Colin
Ardley; Werner Arens; Rodney Baine; Gerald Bentley; Ann Bermingham; Martin Butlin; Lothar Cerny; Irene Chayes;
Andrew Cooper; Claudia Corti; Sonia Dean; Robert Denham; Silke Eberhardt; Michael Ferber; Diane Gillespie;
Nancy Moore Goslee; Jack Grant; Nelson Hilton; Georg Kamp; Horst Meller; Joachim Möller; Jeanne Moskal;
Kirstin Ollech; Marilynn and Donald Olson; Peter Otto; Stuart Peterfreund; Alan Richardson; Eileen Sanzo;
Wilhelm Schlink; Peter Thurmann; Virginia Tufte; Jean Turner; K. D. Verma; John Villalobos; David Worrall,
John Wright; Paul Youngquist; Koji Yukiyama; and Irena Zdanowicz. As always, Robert N. Essick has been the
most important single outside contributor to the checklist, sharing with me his vast knowledge of the market
for Blake books, both old and new. Desmond King-Hele helped with the Darwin section; finally, and on account
of our regular exchange of information, it was David Weinglass who supplied the initial references for about
half of the entries to this year’s rather substantial list of Fuseli references. For her help with the
photographs which illustrate this year’s checklist, I wish to thank Josefine Simon. Morton Paley usefully
commented on an early draft of this research report. Patricia Neill and Morris Eaves not only managed to keep
the <hi rend="i">Quarterly</hi> going on a quarterly schedule despite the delays recklessly caused by their
bibliographer, they also (and vastly) improved the readability of the text in the process of their
copy-editing.</p>

            <p>—Preceded by an introductory note of some 15 lines, Blake’s critical writings are
represented in this anthology by excerpts from his letters of 23 Aug. 1799 to the Revd. Dr. Trussler (36-38),
of 25 Apr. and 6 July 1803 to Thomas Butts (38-39), by a few of his annotations to Reynolds’s 
<hi rend="i">Discourses</hi> (39-41), by some of his notes on “The Last Judgment” (41-43), and of the
annotations to Wordsworth’s <hi rend="i">Poems</hi> (43). The editor briefly discusses Blake’s position in
romantic criticism on pages 15, 18-19, 21, 25, and 28 of his “Introduction.” It comes as some surprise to
find that, in 1989, Peter Kitson is still employing the 1946 Nonesuch version of Keynes’s edition of the
“<hi rend="i">Prose and Poetry</hi> [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]” as the standard text for Blake’s
“statements about literature and art” (36), and that no excerpts from Blake’s interpretation of Chaucer
are supplied. Besides the fragments from Blake’s writings, the book contains selections from Wordsworth,
Barbauld, Coleridge, Keats, Byron, Scott, Shelley, Hazlitt, and a few “Period Critical Reactions.”</p>

            <p>—“The purpose of the edition remains the same: to present all Blake’s verse, including
the scattered fragments and epigrams, and to provide as much annotation as is necessary to make the poetry
accessible to the reader.” However, Stevenson has attempted to bring the scholarly apparatus of his edition,
which proved to be the particular strength of the 1971-75 printings, “up to date.” As is appropriately
noted in the new preface, this has been “no small task.” Thankfully, the editor has “tried not to
interpret or expound any ‘system’ in [Blake’s] works, but to give whatever information is necessary for
the exposition of each poem or passage, so that the reader may be able to interpret more easily for himself”
(xi). Furthermore, Stevenson has resisted the “temptation” to supply “some kind of Index of Symbols,”
realizing that the “danger of such an index lies in its dissociation of the name or word from its context,
so that it appears to be pre-existent, an idea fixed in Blake’s mind quite apart from the poem into which he
then inserts it.” The editor also shows himself well aware that the “most controversial feature of the
first edition turned out to
<pb id="p25-8" n="8"/>
be the modernization of the spelling and punctuation.” Since this “is the policy of the series,” there
was little to be done about this criticism. He hopes, however, “to have reached a not intolerable
compromise, even though it has meant losing the individual flavour of Blake’s page.” Some “major changes
have been made in the text” itself (xii), especially in the arrangement of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi>
In principle then, both the considerable merits of Stevenson’s edition for classroom use and its problematic
stance as a typographical “reading” version of what Blake actually wrote remain unchanged; they are neatly
summed up in the editor’s definition of the “primary purpose” of his book—“to assist the reader
rather than to establish a text” (xiii). While it was Erdman who supplied the basic text for Stevenson’s
first edition in 1971, Bentley’s “Oxford English Texts” now seems to have been employed as well (see
xiii-xiv), and “Doubtful and Spurious Attributions” have been added in an appendix (873-75).</p>

Woodstock Books, 1990. £18.00/$35 cloth.</p>
            <p>—Is there really any need for a facsimile reprint of one of Blake’s publications in
conventional typography in general, and of the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> (which, since 1863, has
been reprinted numerous times) in particular? I think the editor’s decision to include the poetartist’s
pamphlet in his series of publications from the period of “Revolution and Romanticism, 1789-1834” can
indeed be justified. In the study of Blake’s art and writings, facsimiles of the illuminated books have
served a variety of purposes, whereas it may at first seem hard to conceive of similar uses for the reprint of
the catalogue for Blake’s exhibition of 1809-10. If, however, the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> is
to be studied as an unconventional specimen of the species of exhibition and sale catalogues for artists’
one-man shows and in the context of the literary genre of the art catalogue at large, its physical properties
may increasingly become of interest. One may think here, for example, of Robert Strange’s 
<hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue of a Collection of Pictures</hi>, 1769, of James Barry’s <hi rend="i">Account
of a Series of Pictures</hi>, 1783, of Samuel More’s <hi rend="i">Description of the Series of Pictures
Painted by James Barry</hi>, 1792, or of John Hassell’s <hi rend="i">Critical and Descriptive
Observations</hi> on the works of George Morland, 1806. With only 17 copies currently traced, the original of
the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> is almost as rarely found in our libraries as are Blake’s works
in illuminated printing, and studies of its contents that draw on an awareness of the specific literary
traditions at work in the writing of art catalogues of its period are currently being prepared for the press
by Suzanne Matheson and by Alexander Gourlay. Therefore, there certainly seems to be room in the vast field of
Blake-related literature for a facsimile of the Bodleian copy of Blake’s 1809 publication. In 1984, Bentley
included a reprint of copy O (Glasgow University Library) of the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> in
his edition of <hi rend="i">William Blake’s Works in Conventional Typography</hi>(see 
<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 20 [1986-1987]: 77[#1]). There, however, the original 12mo. in sixes had been blown up to
the size of a demy 8vo. volume (to enhance the legibility of the text?), while at the same time the 
<hi rend="i">French Revolution</hi> was considerably reduced to fit the same format (see also #363, below). With
the new (and more expensive) facsimile of copy H scholars may now come into possession of a reproduction that
comes a little closer to the original booklet. A couple of unnecessary discrepancies remain: few will take
exception to the change in factual collation (a 12mo. in sixes turned into a foolscap 8vo.), and to the slight
reduction of overall dimensions this standardization

of page sizes entails. And if the color of the printing paper is not precisely reminiscent of an early
nineteenth-century publication, who is to care? However, it is certainly regrettable that the manuscript
addition—“At N 28 Corner of Broad Street Golden Square” (and with it the double rule between ll. 16 and
17)—has been removed from the title page in the Woodstock Books reprint of copy H, especially since this
variation from the original that is being reproduced is not even mentioned in the editor’s brief
“Introduction” (n. pag. [iii-ix]). In general, it would also have been much easier to recommend this
edition if a slightly more substantial apparatus had been offered to the reader. While there is nothing wrong
with what he says, the editor has to be blamed for what he remains silent about. There is neither a
bibliographical description of the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>, nor a list of the present
locations (and of reproductions) of the paintings and water colors that Blake exhibited in 1809 (both are
supplied in Bentley’s useful 1984 collection of reprints). A discussion of Blake and William Wordsworth is
all very fine, yet its inclusion in a brief introduction like this must seem odd, if
<pb id="p25-9" n="9"/>
questions of context and of literary genre are not addressed at all, and if there is no reference to any of
the studies of Blake’s theory of art and of the <hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi> (by, e.g., Burke,
Eaves, or Gully), let alone the contents of these studies. In the United States, the book and the series are

            <p>—Reporting on studies of romantic literature published as long ago as 1986, Bone in his
review of “Verse and Drama” has “to apologize that <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> and <hi rend="i">WC</hi> have
not been available to [him] in time for consultation, but they will of course be included next year” (353).
Because of the similar absence of entries for all the articles published in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> from the
MLA’s <hi rend="i">International Bibliography</hi> (see #30, below), one is tempted to suspect a conspiracy
here. Bone briefly discusses 1985-86 Blake-related studies by Bate, Bidney, Davis, Gleckner, Essick, McGann,
and Witke on 354-55. In addition, Bate’s study of Shakespeare and the British romantics is reviewed for a
second time in the “Shakespeare” section. There, Bate is said to have “produced an impressively detailed
and painstaking book,” demonstrating that its author “read everything and missed, apparently, nothing”
(230). To be sure, this is a fine description of an important publication, and if I find a minor blemish in
this judgment, it is only because the author of this laudatory note is said to be none other than the author
of the book under review. In other chapters of this annual bibliocritical compilation H. R. Woodhuysen finds
that “for good reason Blake is dealt with only cursorily” (10) in the penultimate volume of the 
<hi rend="i">Index of English Literary Manuscripts</hi>, no such reasons are given. Tom Pinkney, in the

(326); finally, Alan Bower comments on Griffin’s <hi rend="i">Regaining Paradise</hi> (332) and no King’s
biography of Cowper (337).</p>

in previous issues of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>’s own annual reports on the state of research, a small number

Permanent] Collections 5. London: Tate Gallery Publications, 1990. £55.00 cloth and post free.</p>
            <p>—The publication of this volume has been delayed since 1988. It is only with the more recent
changes at the Tate Gallery in mind that one may think of the present catalogue as a kind of testament for the
Gallery’s Blake Room and as the heritage of the compiler, its highly successful former keeper of the
Historic British Collection (on “Blake’s Fate at the Tate,” see #107, below). This third revised edition
of what was formerly <hi rend="i">William Blake: A Complete Catalogue of the Works in the Tate Gallery</hi>
(1st ed., 1957; 2nd rev. ed., 1971) is certainly more than just old wine in an extravagantly priced new
bottle. All the entries have been fully revised, and the catalogue is now much more extensively illustrated,
including a generous selection of some 60 color plates. The “Preface” by Sir Norman Reid (1971 ed.: 5) has
been replaced by that of the new director, Nicholas Serota (1990 ed.: 7-8). Gone is the introduction to the
earlier editions (1971 ed.: 9-19) which was written by the late Anthony Blunt (and at first. one cannot but
wonder whether this omission is another move in the <hi rend="i">damnatio memoriae</hi> of this key figure in
both the history of British art history and of twentieth-century espionage). However, a general introduction
to “The Art of William Blake” by the compiler (which to a large extent draws on the same author’s
introduction to the 1978 exhibition catalogue) serves as a replacement (1990 ed.: 17-26). Sir John
Rothenstein’s essay on “The Formation of the Collection” (1971 ed.: 5-7), too, is now supplanted by a
contribution from Krzysztof Cieszkowski with fuller documentation, though the title has been retained (1990
ed.: 11-16). A more extensive “Chronology” is given (1971 ed.: 20; 1990 ed.: 27-31), and the lists of
references to exhibitions, catalogues, and scholarly literature
<pb id="p25-10" n="10"/>
have been brought up to date (1971 ed.: 21-22; 1990 ed.: 32-37). The “Concordance” (1971 ed.: 23; 1990
ed.: 38-40) has been revised to include the new Tate Gallery inventory numbers and, of course, the new
catalogue numbers of the present publication. It might have been helpful if references to the Tate entries in
Butlin’s <hi rend="i">Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</hi> (1981), which of course supplied the
basis for most of the revisions, had been integrated in this table (they are cited, however, with the
literature listed for each of the items). Despite some minor reshuffling (especially of the works in the
“Miscellaneous Drawings” section of the 1971 ed.: 75-78[#77-83]), the arrangement of the catalogue proper
remains more or less unchanged. Yet the Tate’s holdings of Blake’s prints have now been fully catalogued
for the first time (see 1971 ed.: 24), and this accounts for most of the substantial increase in the number of
catalogue entries. The following list gives some idea of the increase in both the number of original works
that are here documented and of the comprehensiveness of the new catalogue entries: “Early Works c. 1779-c.
1793” (1971 ed.: 25-31 [#1-9]; 1990 ed.: 42-70 [#1-14]), “Miscellaneous Pages, Fragments and Separate
Designs from the Illuminated Books 1789-1795” (1971 ed.: 32-33 [#10-13]; 1990 ed.: 71-81 [#15-24]), “The
Large Colour Prints c. 1795-1805” (1971 ed.: 34-41 [#14-24]; 1990 ed.: 82-105 [#25-34], now including a
discussion of the 1804-05 printing of some of these designs), “Tempera Paintings of Biblical Subjects c.
1799-1800” (1971 ed.: 42-44 [#25-28]; 1990 ed.: 106-17 [#35-39]), “Illustrations to the Bible and Other
Watercolours and Drawings 1800-1805” (1971 ed.: 45-55 [#29-45]; 1990 ed.: 118-44 [#40-57]), “Blake’s
Exhibition 1809” (1971 ed.: 56-57 [#46-48]; 1990 ed.: 145-52 [#58-60]), “Visionary Heads c. 1819-1825”
(1971 ed.: 58-61 [#49-53]; 1990 ed.: 153-64 [#61-67]), “Late Works 1820-27” (1971 ed.: 62-63 [#54-55];
1990 ed.: 165-84 [#68-107]), “Illustrations to the Book of Job c. 1821-1826” (1990 ed.: 185-201
[#108-30]), “Illustrations to Dante’s <hi rend="i">Divine Comedy</hi> 1824-1827” (1971 ed.: 64-74
[#56-76]; 1990 ed.: 202-41 [#131-65]), “Drawings Attributed to Robert Blake 1767-1787” (1971 ed.: 79-80
[#84-87]; 1990 ed.: 242-46 [#166-69]), “Works Formerly Attributed to William Blake” (1971 ed.: 24; 1990
ed.: 247-48 [#170-72]), and finally an “Appendix” in which “R. H.” [i.e., presumably Robin Hamlyn]
documents the gallery’s most recent Blake acquisition, “A Vision: The Inspiration of the Poet” (1990
ed.: 249-51). Although it is certainly to be regretted that at £55 the public will now no longer feel
attracted to buy what in the first two editions also served as a fine and fitting general introduction to
Blake’s art, scholars (a community which in general is rather more indifferent to the “ethics of
publication” than Blake unquestionably was, and which in most cases finds itself in a position that does not
allow for exerting much influence over “marketing decisions”) are very likely to congratulate the compiler
on his latest achievement and to welcome this new catalogue of what is arguably the finest collection
worldwide of Blake’s works as an artist.</p>

Gallery of Victoria.</hi> With an Introduction by Irena Zdanowicz. Robert Raynor Publications in Prints and
Drawings 3. Melbourne, Vic.: National Gallery of Art, 1989.</p>
            <p>—This volume presents a complete and lavishly illustrated account of all the Blake water
colors, prints, and books presently preserved at the National Gallery of Victoria. It was published in
conjunction with an exhibition (14 Sept.-19 Nov. 1989) and an international symposium (16-17 Sept. 1989). The
National Gallery’s large collection of Blake’s Dante water colors are, of course, at the center of both
the catalogue and of the show. However, there is much more to be discovered in this important addition to
catalogues of the holdings of permanent Blake collections. Irena Zdanowicz’s introduction documents “The
Melbourne Blakes—Their Acquisition and Critical Fortunes in Australia” (10-19); Martin Butlin discusses
“Blake’s Late Illustrations to Milton and Dante” (20-44) and catalogues the “Blake Water-Colours in
the National Gallery of Victoria” (45-87 [#1-38]); Ted Gott writes about “The Prints of William Blake”
(88-178) and catalogues “Blake Prints and Books in the National Gallery of Victoria” (179-88 [#39-51]).
This latter section by Gott includes the most recent acquisitions made at Melbourne, copy X of 
<hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>, bought in 1988, and a colored copy of the <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> engravings
which, while it cannot easily be fitted into the color categories that were suggested in the 1980 Clarendon
edition of the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> designs, has a most interesting provenance, obviously having reached
Australia as early as 1837. The exemplary scholarship of the catalogue is supplemented by model reproductions;
not only is there a reproduction for every Blake item in the collection, but every colored work is also
reproduced in color. For the colored copy of the <hi rend="i">NT</hi> engravings at Melbourne see also #188,

Berkeley, CA: U of California P, 1990. $40.00 cloth.</p>
            <p>—The subject of this book may not be of central concern to the majority of Blake scholars and
critics; however, its handling by Donald Fitch represents a stunning bibliographical achievement. As it is,
when visiting the sheet music collection at the Bavarian State Library early in 1990, I had prepared for
inclusion in this year’s checklist a special section of what I thought were some 20 unrecorded and largely
unknown musical settings of Blake’s poetry from the past decade. This section was rendered completely
obsolete by the publication of Fitch’s bibliography. Moreover, the 1402 (!) entries in <hi rend="i">Blake
Set to Music</hi> have made me aware for the first time of the truly awe-inspiring wealth of “musical
settings of the poetry and prose of William Blake” that are now in existence. Who would have thought there
were no less than 636 Blake-related compositions between 1970 and 1979 alone? Fitch has arranged his
bibliography alphabetically by composers’ names, records some biographical dates for each composer, gives
the titles of compositions, and supplies details of the performing combination “as a service to musicians
looking for possible Blake material to perform” (xxvii); he notes the dates of composition, first
performances, and publication wherever they have been available (and the compiler certainly appears to have
invested a lot of work to get in touch with a vast number of the living composers and/or their publishers in
order to learn about details of the compositions); he indicates the length of each piece of music and, in a
final item in each entry, he identifies his sources of information. “The illustrations which enhance this
bibliography were chosen from the drawings and engravings of Blake to show his artistic use of musical
themes” (xxix). Various indices of “Blake Titles” (257-63), of “Performing Combinations” (265-68),
of “Translated Texts” (269), and of the names “of editors, arrangers, translators, performers,
conductors, choreographers, dancers, dedicatees, commissioners, etc.” (271-81) help to make the wealth of
information in Fitch’s book accessible to non-specialists such as myself.</p>

for the National Museum of Western Art, 1990.</p>
            <p>—The first major Blake exhibition commissioned by a Japanese museum was shown in Tokyo from
22 Sept.-25 Nov. 1990. The catalogue which commemorates the event can be recommended to anyone seriously
interested in Blake’s paintings, drawings, prints, and illuminated books. Even if (like the present writer)
one had neither had a chance to see the exhibition, nor is in the habit of reading Japanese, one will find
multiple uses for this pictorial encyclopaedia of the artist’s works. As in the Melbourne catalogue (for
which see #20, above), all the colored paintings and prints are illustrated in color, including (as #23 and
82) the British Museum’s proof copy of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi> copy a, printed in blue-green monochrome,
and a selection of plates from posthumous copy J of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> from Yale, printed in
Tatham’s reddish brown, and (as #12) the Munich copy of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> copy Z, retraced at the
Bavarian State Library only a few years ago and never before reproduced. Even though the plates are relatively
small (four pages from an illuminated book reduced in size to fit one quarto page of the exhibition handbook),
the quality of the exhibition reproductions on a non-glossy paper is generally good, though occasionally one
notes a lack of the chromatic brilliance and depth of Blake’s coloring. Gert Schiff, who will be known to
most readers as the undisputed leading Fuseli scholar of our century, brought a fresh eye to the task of
selecting and commenting on the exhibits, and his catalogue entries should help to reopen the discussion over
quite a number of assumptions concerning the purpose and content of Blake’s works as a visual artist. Except
for the commercial engravings, the full spectrum of Blake’s artistic career is covered; there are examples
of his apprentice works and of his
<pb id="p25-12" n="12"/>
early historical compositions, almost all of the illuminated books are represented, as are eight of the large
color prints; Blake’s water color illustrations and engravings in illustration of Young, the Bible, of Gray,
Milton, Chaucer, the Book of Job and Dante dominate the second part of Schiff’s selection. For the first
time, the “Larger Blake-Varley Sketchbook” was included (as #81) in a public exhibition at Tokyo. The
catalogue, in addition to Schiff’s own essay on “Young Blake and His Moral Rebellion” (5-14; included
only in the “second edition” of the catalogue) and to a biblio- and biographical apparatus by Butlin and
Beth A. Mandelbaum (281-311), contains contributions by David Bindman, Martin Butlin (who was also responsible
for about a third of the catalogue notes), and Robert Essick. Since few will have access to copies of the
authors’ original typescripts (which helped me with the present note), we can only hope that a publisher for
an English-language version of the entire volume will soon be found. Though there is a handlist of the works
on view in English appended to the main body of text (see 265-76), it would be a pity indeed if the commentary
in the catalogue section (53-264) were to remain inaccessible to future commentators of the English-speaking
countries. The same is true of Butlin’s introductory essay on “William Blake 1757-1827” (15-22) and
especially his important summary of “The Evolution of [Blake’s] Visual Means of Expression” (33-39), of
Essick’s newly revised account of “Blake and the Profession of Printmaking” (23-32), and of Bindman’s
article, entitled “‘My own mind is my own church’: Blake, Paine and the French Revolution” (40-51). It
was extremely sad to learn that Gert Schiff, who was a serious and profoundly knowledgeable scholar with an
equally impressive capacity for true friendship (including critical “opposition”), did not live to see the
exhibition he had organized. The translation of this catalogue, which turned out to be the last of his
contributions to the study of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century art history, would be a fitting tribute to
one who is missed by all who knew him.</p>

Wright has contributed an essay which (on seven of the unnumbered pages) discusses “Blake’s Medium,”
“Plates, Prints and Illuminations,” and “Facsimiles and Reproductions.” In closing, Wright suggests
that after 1812 Blake was actively interested in creating a “Stereoptic Art,” and that his readers may for
themselves “experience stereoscopic effects” by patiently gazing at pages from the illuminated books with
the help of a magnifying glass.</p>

cat. Tokyo, Jap.: Japan Folk Crafts Museum, 1990.</p>
            <p>—The second Japanese Blake exhibition of the year 1990 commemorizes the “Great Encounter”
between Blake and Sôetsu (or Muneyoshi) Yanagi who, in 1914, published a study of Blake and then went on to
become the founder of the Mingei (folk crafts) movement in Japan. While there is a “List of Plates”
(97-102) and a mention by the editor of “the original engravings” sent by G. E. Bentley “for display”
(3), there is no list of works on view or a proper catalogue. Therefore, it is difficult to decide which of
the works that are illustrated in the exhibition handbook were actually on show 1 Sept.-28 Oct. 1990. The book
includes 27 color reproductions of Blake’s prints and paintings (33-56), most of which reminded me of the
sets of color postcards that have been issued by the British Museum, the Tate Gallery, and other institutions.
A selection from Blake’s engraved works dominates the section of monochrome plates; these, however, also
include a few reproductions of stoneware by Bernard Leach, of a letter from Yanagi to Leach,
<pb id="p25-13" n="13"/>
and of Yanagi’s publication on Blake (57-96). The introductory essays are printed in Japanese and English.
In “A Delightful Exhibition on ‘A Great Encounter of William Blake and Soetsu Yanagi’” Bunsho Jugaku,
an old friend of Yanagi, relates a few of his reminiscences. At the age of 90 he comments on the central role
played by Leach in spreading Blake’s reputation in Japan during the early years of our century, and he tells
of the two years during which he co-edited with Yanagi the journal <hi rend="i">Blake and Whitman</hi> (9).
“William Blake and the Empire of the Imagination” by G. E. Bentley, Jr. introduces the Japanese public to
some of Blake’s central ideas (10-21), while Kimiyoshi Yura’s “The Great Encounter: Sôetsu Yanagi and
William Blake” (22-31) introduces Western students of Blake to Yanagi’s work. The reference section of the
volume consists of a “Chronology of Important Dates” and a “Selected Bibliography” for the study of
Blake (104-09).</p>

            <p>—Adams employes the word “liberal” to describe “the sort of education” that will
function in a “liberating” way. It is not without justification then that he describes his approach to a
restructuring of academic procedure as “neo-Blakean.” The collection places Adams’s more recent
contributions to the literary criticism of Blake’s writings, most published in the course of the past
decade, in a new perspective: the essays “move from an initial statement about [the] reading of Blake
through a series of critical essays into a final group devoted to educational issues” (xi). Seven of the 17
chapters that make up the book are concerned with Blake’s writings and/or with the exemplary character that
Adams assigns to them for a theory of liberal education. Readers will find reprints of “The Dizziness of
Freedom; or, Why I Read William Blake” (3-17), “Synecdoche and Method” from <hi rend="i">Critical
Paths</hi> (21-51), “Must a Poem Be a Perfect Unity?” (52-59), “Titles, Titling, and Entitlement To”
(111-43), and “Revisiting Reynolds’ <hi rend="i">Discourses</hi> and Blake’s Annotations” (184-98).
“Blake’s Cities: Verbal Cities” (199-205), and a “Neo-Blakean Prolegomena to an Unlikely Academic
Structure” (272-87) are printed here for the first time. With these chapters, Adams’s impressive
contribution to an understanding of some central issues in the interpretation of Blake’s works is now easily
accessible. Regardless of what one thinks of Adams’s account of the “proper organization of the liberal
arts and sciences” (275), his demonstration that “critical endeavors” can still be “closely related to
and informing and informed by . . . teaching” (xi), his commitment to issues of educational theory and his
concern for the “liberating” potential of a reformed university system are certainly challenging. And
while personally I would want to take issue (in terms of Adams’s demands for teaching the history of
criticism) with a somewhat anecdotal and sloppy approach to an analysis of what happened to the theory of
criticism and critical value judgments in the late 1960s and early 1970s (see 277), I found that Adams’s
“[appropriation of] four ideas from William Blake” (272) for the construction of an “Unlikely Academic
Structure” is a generally rewarding enterprise, well worth the attention of all those who are “trying to
sustain the creative conflict of myth and antimyth” (286) in the practice of their teaching.</p>

Studies</hi> 105 (1987): 113-36.</p>
            <p>—Summing up previous interpretations of the water colors and engravings, Baine starts out
from questioning that “Blake’s <hi rend="i">Dante</hi>, the most powerful artistic recreation of 
<hi rend="i">The Divine Comedy</hi>,” has to be considered “a perversion . . . a travesty of Dante” (113).
Following an impressive critique of the literature on the Dante series from Rossetti and Yeats to Roe and
Klonsky, the author reaches the conclusion that “the current notion that in the <hi rend="i">Purgatorio</hi>
and the <hi rend="i">Paradiso</hi> Blake was burlesquing Dante” is completely mistaken. “On the contrary,
Blake never ceased to insist that Dante’s vision was true; and in his designs for the Earthly Paradise and
the <hi rend="i">Paradiso</hi> Blake presented an understanding and sympathetic refinement of that vision”
(134). The new light thrown by Baine on Blake’s illustrative interpretation of Dante’s <hi rend="i">Divina
Commedia</hi>, then, differs a lot from the “antagonistic” (113) understanding that until recently figured
as received opinion in Blake studies. At the same time, it brings out the contours of a fully revised grasp of
Blake’s meaning in the water colors and the engraved series, a revision that in many respects is reminiscent
of the results of David Fuller’s study of 1988 and of Tinkler-Villani’s recent book (see 
<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 23 [1989-1990]: 131 [#73], and #186, below). Since the arguments presented by these
scholars mutually complement and reinforce each other, it is important to point out that the present article
was accepted for publication in 1986 and that the 1987 volume of <hi rend="i">Dante Studies</hi> did not
appear in print until 1990. Baine’s and Fuller’s articles and the book by Valeria Tinkler-Villani all must
have been written and then have been in production at much the same time, with none of the authors knowing the
work of the others. This, I think, lends additional weight to their findings. But even those readers who,
unlike the present writer, do not agree with the central arguments presented by Fuller and Baine will be
grateful for their endeavor in reopening the debate over Blake’s Dante designs in a most challenging and
certainly productive manner.</p>

            <p>—Besides this elegantly written introduction to Blake’s writings, the volume contains
numerous other passing references to his poetry. In addition, there is a brief discussion of his art in the
context of British eighteenth- and nineteenth-century painting by Michael Rosenthal (see 133-35) who, not
surprisingly, places Blake in one line with Fuseli (see 133) and Flaxman (see 135), before turning to West and
Northcote as representatives of a more “traditional” style of history painting (see 135-36).</p>

            <p>—This essay is the published version of Bentley’s paper for the Art Gallery of Ontario
symposium on 5 Feb. 1983. Employing materials from his forthcoming study of late eighteenth-century book
illustration, Bentley’s article succeeds in concisely locating Blake’s peculiar position in the tradition
of British book illustration. For another paper, read on the same occasion, see #98, below.</p>
            <p>51. Bentley, G. E., Jr. “Blake’s Works as Performances: Intentions and Inattentions.” 
<hi rend="i">Text: Transactions of the Society for Textual Scholarship</hi> 4 (1988): 319-41.</p>
            <p>—The author starts out with a discussion of “The Tyger” and from a similar point of view
as provided in greater detail by John Grant’s recent study of the same illuminated poem (see #101 and, in
addition, #127 and 156, below). “The vision of terror evoked by the poem . . . must be contrasted,
complemented, controlled by the smug pussycat of the design, which Blake intended his reader to absorb 
<hi rend="i">before</hi> he has apprehended the poem” (319). Bentley makes a similar statement in his review of
the new edition of Stedman’s <hi rend="i">Narrative</hi> (listed as #487, below); here this example of the
peculiar relationship between various media in Blake’s productions is employed to draw attention, once more,
to the peculiar problems that the editor of the printer-poet’s works is confronted with (see 321-30). While
admitting that in “most copies of Blake’s works in Illuminated Printing, the text itself is invariable”
(329), the author points out the critical limitations even of the most trustworthy facsimiles if compared with
a variorum edition (see 323-29). The latter is said to be more important, however, where the poet’s works in
conventional typography, especially <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> (see 329-30), are concerned, though it
is itself insufficient to give an account of the <hi rend="i">visual</hi> variants in the corpus of the
illuminated books. The final section of the essay therefore discusses the changing order of the plates in
separate copies of most of the illuminated books. Bentley finds (as others have done before) that the “only
solution appropriate to Blake is to reproduce each variant copy, that is, each coloured copy, in a separate
facsimile. Each variant copy produced by Blake should be treated as a separate ‘performance,’ with its own
integrity, its own beauty, its own raison d’être. Blake did not produce a ‘standard’ and invariable
literary work” (334).</p>
            <pb id="p25-15" n="15"/>
            <p>52. Bentley, Gerald [i.e., G. E.], Jr. “The Shadow of Los: Embossing in Blake’s 
<hi rend="i">Book of Urizen.</hi>” <hi rend="i">Art Bulletin of Victoria</hi> 30 (1989): 18-23.</p>
            <p>—Bentley comments briefly on the differences between the National Gallery of Victoria’s
impression from <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi>, plate 21, and “other performances of the same plate” (18). He
describes what was actually etched on the copper plate and what was added only in the color-printing process
(19-22), and then concentrates on the “heavy pressure used in printing this impression of 
<hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> plate 21 [which] is very unusual” (19). Here, the author quotes Ted Gott’s plausible
hypothesis that such “heavy press-work would answer Blake’s need for additional force to gain a reasonable
second impression from the thinner layer of pigment left on the plate without re-inking” the plate in the
process of color printing (19; see #20, above). In addition, Bentley believes that the embossing, with the
“fairly deep recesses” (22) it has created in the paper of the Melbourne pull, calls for a partial
revision of Robert Essick’s arguments concerning the “shallow etching” of Blake’s relief etchings and
the light printing pressure Blake would usually employ (see 22). However, similar embossing effects can be
observed in some of the pages of the Munich copy R of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion.</hi>
While in the color-printed areas of that copy I cannot make out any indications for their having been pulled
without previous re-inking, it was printed on rather strong 1794 Whatman paper. Therefore, it seems possible
to me that, according to the physical properties of the various papers he employed and according to the
varying dampness of the printing paper, Blake would also vary the precise amount of printing pressure. It
would follow then, that the printing qualities of the paper, not just the problem of inking and re-inking the
plate, occasioned the varying amount of (the visibility of the) printing pressure. On the other hand, the copy
at the Bavarian State Library certainly shows no relief embossment extreme enough to necessitate a revision of
Essick’s arguments for shallow etching. These arguments, it ought to be remembered, are based on the
physical evidence of the only fragment from one of Blake’s relief etched plates which has survived. The
embossed paper of the Melbourne print certainly is an irrefutable indication for high printing pressure; yet
the differences between light and heavy embossing in eighteenth-century papers are a matter of microscopic
measurements, and how they could possibly yield more than an approximate indication for the absolute depth or
the shallowness of the actual biting of the copper remains unclear to the present writer.</p>

            <p>—Blake’s “family did business with the [St. James Parish] Workhouse and School, and [he]
must have known their workings intimately. . . . It is the purpose of this essay to set out some of the chief
facts about St. James Workhouse and its School in Blake’s time and the evidence for the Blake family
connection with it” (79). Bentley’s research is based on the documents discovered and first published by
Stanley Gardner, whose “purpose is largely critical”; Bentley’s own purpose in the present commentary on
some of the materials from <hi rend="i">Blake Records Supplement</hi> is “largely historical” (80).</p>

unproductive” connections of Earl Spencer and Blake. Bentley then adds “a couple of facts to what has
heretofore been known” (203). As a result, he states that “Blake had, then, a number of opportunities for
access to and patronage from the greatest book collector of his day, opportunities from which disappointingly
little materialized” (209). While there are “Captions for Plates” (209), the three reproductions called

            <p>—The author of this dissertation seeks “to extricate and elucidate the fascinating
conceptual parallels between the works of William Blake, Johann Georg Hamann, and Jakob Boehme. These radical
Christian visionaries evince a social vision which anticipates and parallels major Marxian tenets.” Bethea
“believe[s]” and, one should think, attempts to demonstrate that “their writings are primarily concerned
to confront what they perceived as the false, distortive ideologies of their epochs with what might be termed
visionary warfare.” The introduction surveys “the various manners in which all three of these visionaries
have been wrongly branded as mystics,” stressing “how antithetical to mysticism their works are.” For a
somewhat similar approach which, however, is considerably broader and less specialized in perspective, see

1989 “Wiener Festwochen” (27 Apr.-6 Aug. 1989) only a few weeks before the typescript of the translation

            <p>—A brief chapter on Fuseli and Blake in a book designed for the occultist’s coffee-table.
Its author dived deep into the world of the “unexplored.” Unfortunately, he seems to have been fascinated
by his findings to such an extent that he decided never to come up, where his results might have been examined
in the cold light of reason. And yet, in “the light of what we have learnt about analytical psychology it
seems reasonable [!] to assume that behind all those signs of inner conflict and all the obscure prophetic
presentments [of Blake] lay a host of reallife experiences” (9)—after all, here is an insight that is
beyond dispute. There are brief biographies of Blake and Fuseli at the end of the slim quarto volume (see 83
and 86) and the two artists are represented with nine out of the 60 color plates that are the book’s 
<hi rend="i">raison d’être.</hi> The original Italian edition on which this English translation is based was

            <p>—For Bromberg it is quite clear that “Blake’s illustrations of other poets’ works must
be understood as conscious discussions between his visual and their verbal representations.” While the same,
of course, may be said of <hi rend="i">any</hi> pictorial representation of some passage from a literary
source, it soon becomes evident that in this case more than a mere truism is meant. Following Roe (rather than
joining the more recent attempts at a demystification of Blake’s Dante water colors), the author examines
the “landscapes and architecture in Blake’s water color visions of Dante’s <hi rend="i">Inferno</hi> and
<hi rend="i">Purgatorio</hi> [that] compose the most elaborate and abundant visual images of the state he
called <hi rend="i">Ulro</hi> in his own poetry, a nightmare world of solipsistic alienation” (41). The
water colors, of which three are reproduced, are described in terms that the author has borrowed from
Blake’s own writings (to the effect that Dante’s voice here seems all but suffocated), and the result of
such circular reasoning comes as no surprise: the Dante designs are seen to embody “Blake’s central
criticism of the mythology and theology that inspired Dante, whom he sees as still enslaved by dualism and the
Natural Religion of judgment” (50). The direction of Bromberg’s argument may well be correct, and yet
methodologically her procedure seems arbitrary to such an extent that on its basis any intelligent person
would find no difficulty (with a little help from Erdman’s <hi rend="i">Concordance</hi>) in proving or
refuting almost any interpretation she or he happens to prefer. See also #20, 47, 70, 85, 149, and 186 in the

            <p>—The author is here concerned with “the parallel of Blake’s and Jung’s procedures,”
and he finds that “Blake in his myth of the Four Zoas and Jung in his depiction of the psyche begin from
similar materials similarly regarded. They work them up into intelligibility by comparisons in which Eastern
religion and Gnosticism are prominent, and to which alchemical symbolism . . . contributes. Yet for neither
does the response to these traditions sever his essential rootedness in that of Christianity . . . To my mind,
their parallel methods were valid, and since they were independently pursued, the resulting pictures of the
psyche and its dynamics go to confirm each other” (66).</p>

“poet’s thesis consists of the need for a humanist social order. Corruption—religious, economic, and
political—forms the basis for these inflammatory, ideological poems. In present day terminology these poets
can be said to advocate a revised and strengthened human rights policy . . . . these poems become capsule
philosophies that society may employ as scholarly referents but not as pragmatic structures” (175). The

            <p>—Reattributing to Blake a drawing in the Fogg Museum of Art which the author himself had
previously rejected, Butlin now ascribes to Blake no less than three pen and wash drawings which—only
recently—had changed hands under the name of Flaxman, an attribution which the author himself calls
“understandable” (107). To the present writer this part of Butlin’s group of drawings represents a very
questionable addition to the Blake corpus, and the respective arguments in
<pb id="p25-17" n="17"/>
Butlin’s essay may well represent a classic example for the tricky and—in three out of six
cases—possibly vicious circle of what Jacob Burckhardt termed the “Attribuzlertum” (attributionizing) of
art historians. On the other hand, one certainly ought to congratulate the author (and David Bindman) on the
discovery of the three other drawings, including the retraced study for “The Complaint of Job” (with a
sketch for Gray’s “The Bard” on the verso).</p>

            <p>—Irene Chayes attempts “to identify the likely sources of Blake’s knowledge of particular
works” and “to reconstruct as well as possible his ways of adopting and putting to use in his own work the
varied images and motifs he encountered” (28). To do so, the author outlines the “means through which
Blake would have had knowledge of antique art” (29), and considers his “uses of images, mainly figural,
from a necessarily limited selection of antique sculpture” (30); next, she turns to Blake’s
“borrowings” and “adaptions” (37) of visual motifs first coined in antique sculpture, and argues for
the reliefs published in Bartoli’s <hi rend="i">Admiranda Romanorum Antiquitatum</hi> and similar
collections as a source for Blake’s <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> designs and various images in the illuminated
books. An investigation into Blake’s use of engraved gems as models for some of his figures leads up to
“broader questions” concerned with “a fundamental and unresolved stylistic conflict in Blake’s own art
. . . between the classical . . . and what in theoretical terms he came to call the ‘Gothic’” (56). For

chaos, Eden, the Fall, and “the status of the logocentric endeavor which is so strongly inscribed in the

            <p>—The volume contains three essays which, “along with a fourth, by John Beer . . . were
first presented at a Symposium held at the University of Adelaide on 21 July 1989” (6). Two of the papers
now published are on Blake. Michael J. Tolley examines “Marriages of Heaven and Hell: Blake’s Enigmatic
Title-Page” (8-24) and finds that “Blake has deliberately confused his title in order to make the reader
question whether what is truly desirable is one Marriage of Heaven and Hell . . . or a multiplicity of
particular marriages, in and through which might persist the possibility of progress” (16). Nelson
Hilton’s essay is concerned with the reader’s construction of the singer-subject in “‘I’ Sings
Blake’s <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>” (25-48). He exemplifies this process by re-reading “The Lamb”
(28-29), “Infant Joy” (29-30), “The Little Black Boy” (30-37), and “London” (37-39) with his usual
alertness to phenomena of the sound and polysemous meaning of Blake’s words, before he investigates the
“possible Biblical contexts for ‘To Tirzah’” (46), with some surprising results. In their preface
(1-6) the editors usefully question “the traditional notion of a Romantic movement” (4) and supply some
broader contexts for the essays themselves.</p>

            <p>—The author has chosen for his study a path that has rarely been trodden in modern Blake
criticism (but see #203-04, below, for an alternative approach to the problem of “madness”). His
far-ranging examination of Blake’s imagery, both pictorial and poetical, attempts to arrive at a new
understanding of “Blake’s anti-ideological ethic” (634) and of his concept of self-annihilation. In
order to do so, Cooper follows up a problem which
<pb id="p25-18" n="18"/>
had been posed by Mitchell in 1982 and urges “a return to the old question of Blake’s madness despite its
ostensible vulgarity” and to a consideration of “the subjective dimension” (585) which, however, he is
considering as part of a much larger sociohistorical milieu.</p>

            <p>—Corti studies the “paradigm of transgression” in Blake’s writings on multiple
“levels of operation” and in all “its various forms” (87). She also outlines a “transgressive”
tradition, leading from Blake to Bloch or Altizer, in order to describe Blake’s continuing importance in
modern thought.</p>

Poetry.” <hi rend="i">Dissertation Abstracts International</hi> 50 (1989-1990): 2904A. U of York.</p>
            <p>—Philip Cox has written a detailed thesis which supplies a critical reexamination of the
ground previously covered in David Wagenknecht’s monograph of 1973: “the role played by traditions of
pastoral poetry in the work of William Blake.” Before “looking at the social and literary relationship
between pastoral and epic poetry,” the author presents “an analysis of various works by Cowper and
Coleridge, and a study of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>, . . . [of the] sophisticated use of pastoral in
the early <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> . . .[and of] the way in which pastoral is made socially
relevant in <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence. . . . The Four Zoas</hi> is examined . . . in light of a
discussion of Dyer’s georgic poem <hi rend="i">The Fleece.</hi>” As is indicated by the quotation that
serves as the title for Cox’s dissertation, <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> is studied in detail (chapters 4 and
5), demonstrating “how it rejects the temptations of conventional pastoral and commits itself to a return to
the city.” In <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> Cox sees the optimism that informs the narrative of 
<hi rend="i">Milton</hi> “compromised by the difficulties which Blake experienced in his own life after his
return from Felpham. Nonetheless, the poem ends in a triumphal vision” which the author sees in part as “a
re-working of pastoral themes and concerns.” Throughout the thesis it is “argued that Blake engages with
pastoral conventions in order to challenge what he sees as their innate conservatism. This results in a new,
politically radical use of the pastoral.” For a review of a closely related paper which the author read at
the 1990 Twickenham Blake conference see #144, below. As a complementary account of Blake’s looking
“towards a redeemed city” Sanzo’s recent article (see #172, below) ought to be consulted; see also #44,

53-72.</p>
            <p>—In order to “understand Blake’s relation to the history of ideas—his reactions to, and
his understanding and transformation of, philosophic thought,” the author studies “the use he made of
particular philosophic ideas in his poetry” (53). She looks with scrutiny at the role of an “unholy
triumvirate” (55) that, under changing names, was assigned to Bacon, Newton, and Locke in Blake’s
writings—and she asks important questions. “Looking at Blake’s choice of philosophical targets, one is
startled at the presence there of the political liberals of his time. It is not immediately obvious why he
chooses Locke, Voltaire, and Rousseau to symbolize human repression and the oppressive forces rampant in
Europe when these philosophers, like Blake himself, object to the reigning tyrannical European monarchies,
enunciate democratic principles, and justify rights of political revolution” (55-56). Doskow further
discusses Blake’s critique of Berkeley, Hume, and Voltaire as well as the painter-poet’s “imaginative
alternative” (70) which transforms “philosophical argument . . . into art through imaginative vision,
myth, and symbolic action” (71). See also #38 and 72, above.</p>

<hi rend="i">Dissertation Abstracts International</hi> 51 (1990-1991): 167A. U of South Florida.</p>
            <p>—The author’s aim in writing this dissertation has been to both expand and refine
“previous investigations by distinguishing between pictorial and poetic messages present in the early stages
of Blake’s myth, as expressed in <hi rend="i">The Songs of Innocence and Experience</hi> [sic] up through
his Minor Prophecies.” The “degree of consistency” East has been able to establish is measured against
six “major postulates, in place at the onset of Blake’s myth, [which] remain constant through the period
of investigation. They are: (1) Primacy of the Imagination, (2) Contrary States, (3) Universal Jesus, (4)
Human Form Divine, (5) Imprisoning Effect of the Body, and (6) Revolution.” Though East is prepared to admit
that during the 1790s “the thrust of [Blake’s] philosophy changed to place more emphasis upon
Revolution,” the “results of this study” have led the author to the conviction “that Blake was largely
systematic in his portrayal [?] of a ‘composite art’ of poetic and pictorial messages in his
mythology.”</p>

1. West Cornwall, CT: Locust Hill P, 1990. $30.00 cloth.</p>
            <p>—Mark Trevor Smith supplies an “Introduction” (xi-xvii) with brief summaries to this
collection of original essays, pointing out that it is their “business” to distinguish “between
Blake’s spiritual understanding of the Bible and a natural understanding.” The authors, in one way or
another, are all concerned with the “two opposing ways” in which “Blake re-creates the Bible . . .: he
re-writes by repeating, imitating, honoring, but he also re-writes by denying, contradicting, making new”
(xi). Three of the essays are concerned primarily with Blake’s imagery in the <hi rend="i">Night
Thoughts</hi> water colors, in the Bible, and in the Milton illustrations, while the other three examine
Blake’s verbal reaction towards Watson, his poetic use of biblical references in 
<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, and his knowledge of, as well as his creative interest in, Hebrew. All of them are
said to pursue “the very Blakean project of using minute particulars to confront mass assumptions, to
consolidate error, to find a spiritual understanding of Blake’s Bible” (xii). In a sequel to his earlier
studies of Blake’s water color illustrations to the poetry of Milton (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 17
[1983-1984]: 65 [#55]; 23 [1989-1990]: 129 [#58]), J. M. Q. Davies writes about “Apollo’s ‘Naked Human
Form Divine’: The Dynamics of Meaning in Blake’s <hi rend="i">Nativity Ode</hi> Designs” (3-40).
Florence Sandler presents a historical revision of some one-dimensional assumptions about the position of
Bishop Watson and Blake’s annotations in “‘Defending the Bible’: Blake, Paine, and the Bishop on
Atonement” (41-70). John E. Grant, one of the editors of the Clarendon edition of the <hi rend="i">Night
Thoughts</hi> water colors, is concerned with the Bible as a medium for Blake’s visual critique of Young in
“Jesus and the Powers That Be in Blake’s Designs for Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi>”
(71-115). Mary Lynn Johnson expands and particularizes (with some
<pb id="p25-19" n="19"/>
overlap) her earlier studies of Blake’s Bible illustrations (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 21 [1987-1988]: 58
[#67]; 23 [1989-1990]: 134 [#96]) in a study of “David’s Recognition of the Human Face of God in Blake’s
Designs for the Book of Psalms” (117-56). Mark Trevor Smith is “Striving with Blake’s Systems”
(157-78) in an essay that concentrates on “the Reuben episodes and the birth of Jesus, because these two
Bible allusions are the longest and most powerful examples . . . of the paradoxical combination of
system-smashing and system-constructing” (158) in <hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> Finally, Sheila A. Spector
gives a detailed account of “Blake as an Eighteenth-Century Hebraist” (179-229) in the intellectual and
social context of eighteenth-century Hebraism. In this continuation of her earlier work on the subject (see
<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 18 [1984-1985]: 105 [#100]; 22 [1988-1989]: 49 [#117]; 23 [1988-1989]: 140 [#153]; and
#180, below), the author explores Blake’s knowledge of Hebrew and contemporary Hebrew linguistics. Spector
finds that in our conclusions about both his “correct” and his “incorrect” use of the language “we
must be extremely cautious” (213) before deciding about the poet’s possible, and possibly consistent,
intentions.</p>

            <p>—The much disputed attribution of the design and the two lines of doggerel on the “Felpham
Rummer” to William Blake “cannot be accepted at face value. The history of the rummer, the technical and
artistic characteristics of the engravings on it, and the relationship between these images and Blake’s life
and known works all need careful consideration” (90). And this is exactly what is given to each of these
questions in the present article. As a result, Essick is able to sum up his findings about this “further
testimony to the range of [Blake’s] graphic inventiveness” in saying that the “preponderance of the
evidence indicates that the Felpham Rummer was inscribed and decorated by William Blake. The arguments for its
being a memorial to Blake’s mental condition in 1803 by a third party, or a forgery . . . are not
sustainable. . . . The authorship of the couplet remains the only vexing question” (100).</p>

Language Notes</hi> 27.3 (1990): 27-33.</p>
            <p>—The article briefly documents Blake’s artistic relationship, both visual and verbal, with
the fictional author of the <hi rend="i">Iliad</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Odyssey</hi> (27-28); it then turns
to the question which edition of these epics and—more specifically—which copy Blake had used (28). Next,
Essick supplies a detailed description of a copy of Chapman’s translation of the <hi rend="i">Iliad</hi>
(published c. 1611) that is bound with an early issue of Chapman’s <hi rend="i">Odyssey</hi> translation (c.
1614), which has a Linnell provenance, and has recently been added to the author’s collection (29-31). This
in turn enables Essick—though he remains “far from certain” (31)—to present what is at least “a good
candidate” for Blake’s working copy of Homer, “with considerable circumstantial evidence in its favor”
(32). Linnell’s portrait drawing of George Chapman that is pasted to the inside front cover of this volume
has since been reproduced by Essick as fig. 17 in his latest “Marketplace” report (see 
<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 24 [1990-1991]: 235 [for which read 19]).</p>
            <p>88. Essick, Robert N. “William Blake’s <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, Plate 51.” 
<hi rend="i">Art Bulletin of Victoria</hi> 31 (1990): 20-25.</p>
            <p>—The author carefully describes the loose impression of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 51 at
Melbourne and the impression from the same plate which is part of copy E in the Mellon collection. Essick
refers to the Linnell provenance of the impression now in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria,
to the fact that Blake has numbered this print “51” (which sets it apart from the separate impression
formerly in the collection of Sir Geoffrey Keynes), and to the basic printing colors (orange was used in the
Melbourne impression, black for copy E). He then examines the color of the framing lines and compares
Blake’s hand-tinting of both impressions which are here reproduced in color side-by-side. Further evidence
that the author is able to employ in his study was only recently supplied by Ted Gott’s discovery of an
“1820” watermark in the National Gallery’s impression (see #20, above). In conclusion, Essick
convincingly argues that the “compound of similarities and differences between the two prints at issue
strongly suggest that the [National] Gallery [of Victoria]’s example was originally produced for inclusion
in copy E and that the impression now part of that volume is a substitute.” This “substitution theory”
(24) is then placed into the larger context of Blake’s general—and “more than a little
cavalier”—attitude towards the “standards implicit in conventional book production” (25).</p>

Hölderlin.” <hi rend="i">Dissertation Abstracts International</hi> 51 (1990-1991): 157A. Princeton U.</p>
            <p>—“Poetry that identifies itself as visionary or inspired imitates forms of discourse
originating in Biblical and Classical literature while laying claim to a unique act of communication with the
reader. This study examines such poetry, primarily through the examples of William Blake and Friedrich
Hölderlin, to determine the relations it sets up between speaking subject, audience, and previous texts.”
At the center of Angela Esterhammer’s thesis are interpretations of these relationships in “Blake’s 
<hi rend="i">Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, and Hölderlin’s lyrics ‘Wie
wenn am Feiertage . . .,’ ‘Patmos,’ and ‘Griechenland’ [all of which] implicitly revise Genesis and
the mythology of creation while negotiating between the different modes of perception offered by seeing,
hearing, and reading.” The author has aimed “to clarify the properties of a hitherto vague tradition of
visionary poetry, to locate Blake and Hölderlin in a continuity extending from Milton to twentieth-century
writers . . ., and to suggest a productive avenue for collaboration between speech-act linguistics and
literary criticism.”</p>

P, 1990. 53-58. £22.50 cloth/£7.99 paper.</p>
            <p>—The Blake chapter is intended to document the “social Relations of the Romantic poets”
(51). It makes mention of the Johnson circle, considers “the financial arrangements under which these
writers actually lived in the 1790s” (53-54), refers to “the initial apparent unity of radical enthusiasm
for the Revolution” and its subsequent “fragmentation” (55), and finds (not surprisingly) that after
“the
<pb id="p25-20" n="20"/>
mid-1790s Blake’s work becomes more inaccessibly complex and private in its sources and symbolism. The sense
of a possible audience appears lost, and in this respect Blake’s career is consonant with those of many
London radicals” (56). This streamlined assumption will sound all too familiar to students of the ‘old’
historicism. The gap between text and “context” is reflected by the division of the book into three parts
with its neat separation of the “Hostorical Context” (7-50), the “Social Relations” of the authors
(51-64), and the “Literary Scene” (65-85). However, the “general readers” or the “undergraduate or
advanced level students” (ix) of the 1990s that are the intended audience of Everest’s introduction may
feel inclined to locate his approach with the ‘new’ historicism, which is hinted at by the author’s
acknowledging “a general influence from Professor [Marilyn] Butler’s work” (x) and by the stress he puts
on historical information.</p>

            <p>—Evetts-Secker describes desire as “both motive and means” (1) in Blake’s 
<hi rend="i">The Gates of Paradise</hi>, and she discusses the “consumation [sic] of desire” which “brings
death” as the “central experience” (3) for an understanding of “My Pretty Rose Tree.” “Though the
common notion is that man dies of longing, the poet strikingly insists that man dies only when he refuses
longing” (4).</p>

            <p>—Ferber analyses the “Preludium” to <hi rend="i">America</hi>, in order to reconstruct
the poet’s “idea, or ideal, of social revolution before anything resembling a crisis or conversion [to a
more private Christian faith] can be traced” (74). The author looks closely, for example, at the late
eighteenth-century meaning of such terms as “revolution” and “rebellion” (75), at the “persistent
and extensive [display] of astronomical and meteorological phenomena” (76) and at their link with political
events in Blake’s texts and designs, at the variant use of plots from the genre of “chivalric romance”
(79) in <hi rend="i">America</hi>, or at the implications of the poet’s use of the motif of a “conquest
and cultivation of a virgin land” (80). The myth of Orc and the Shadowy Female, as well as Blake’s idea of
the relation between revolutions and violence, are thus presented in a new light. Ferber returns to Blake’s

            <p>—For once, here is a publisher who has dared to commission a professional and renowned Blake
scholar to write a brief introduction to Blake’s poetry that is now published in a series of books primarily
aimed at classroom use. This decision, I feel, has paid off, and Ferber has achieved a lot in the compass of
only 129 pages. If Ferber’s introduction can be recommended with less of the qualifications that this type
of publication usually calls for, it is because his approach does <hi rend="i">not</hi> ignore or slight, by
offering some one-dimensional pat solution, the serious difficulties every reader of Blake is bound to
encounter. Rather, the author has put into practice a demand central to all critical thinking; therefore, he
sets out with an appropriate warning: “we find on the library shelves a mystical Blake, a neoplatonic Blake,
a gnostic Blake and a cabbalistic Blake, not to mention a materialist Blake who disliked mysticism,
neoplatonism, gnosticism and cabbalism; a radical and a conservative Blake, a heretical inner-light Protestant
and an orthodox Anglican; a Jungian and a Freudian Blake; a spokesman of patriarchal oppression and a herald
of women’s liberation; a retrograde mythologist of origins and a precursor of the post-structuralist
dissolution of all starting points.” Such a list is not altogether new, yet it is important to have it in a
book of this kind (and it may even be taken as a warning against some of the dangers I see inherent in other
publications listed and superficially criticized in the present checklist). Even more important, however, is
that the author writes with a clear sense that he himself (and just as I myself, or you yourself) is “not
exempt from having appropriated” Blake to his (my or your) “purposes” (viii). Realizing that all the
“Blake dictionaries, concordances, annotated editions and systematic interpretations” are as likely to
“intimidate” as to encourage the uninitiated student, that their effect may not all and always be “to
the good” (112), Ferber works from the following, supportive assumption: “Blake is difficult and remains
difficult, but not so difficult that a beginner cannot reach the essentials, and take great pleasure in
reaching them” (ix-x). It is this position, Ferber’s attempt not to “sound too certain or serene” and
“to indicate doubts, difficulties and disagreements among interpreters” (112) that I like in a book which
introduces its readers to <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> (1-18), <hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi>
(19-51), <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> (52-63), <hi rend="i">Visions</hi> and <hi rend="i">America</hi>

            <p>—This is a splendidly concise account of Blake’s (and our) need for a “counter-vision of
the Bible” (272) and of the “metaphorical framework” (277) that had shaped the conventional assumptions
concerning the nature of God, Man, the Creation, the Fall and Apocalypse. As always, the results of Frye’s
astonishing critical ability for the systematic explication and interpretation of the most complex literary
phenomena are almost too good to be true. <hi rend="i">Myth and Metaphor</hi> is “the eighth collection of
Northrop Frye’s essays,” and—alas!—the last to be published during his lifetime. With only a few
exceptions the papers that make up this new volume “began as public lectures” (xiii). “Blake’s
Bible” was previously unpublished and had been “presented as an address to the St. James Piccadilly Blake
Society, London, 2 June 1987” (xi). It comes as no surprise from this doyen of Blake scholarship that the
works of the poetartist are referred to in 16 out of the 24 essays selected by Denham. They treat such
subjects as “The Dialectic of Belief
<pb id="p25-21" n="21"/>
and Vision” (93-107), “The Responsibilities of the Critic” (124-40), “Literature as a Critique of Pure
Reason” (168-82), or “Literature and the Visual Arts” (183-95). The editor’s introduction supplies a
useful outline of “the major contexts in which the essays here might be placed” (xiv). It is much to be
lamented that Northrop Frye died only a few months after this volume had appeared in print. See also the

“the name of Blake [was seen] in letters of such vast size outside the Art Gallery” (1). Frye refers to
Coleridge’s distinction between fancy and imagination in an attempt to distinguish between “the levels of
illustration and illumination” (2) in Blake’s art and poetry. These two levels, after having been defined,
are then employed to structure a far-ranging and magisterial account of the position of the biblical paintings
in Blake’s thought. For another paper, read on the same occasion, see #50, above; obviously, the preceding

Literature in Transition 1880-1920</hi> 33 (1990): 5-28.</p>
            <p>—The “Mental Warfare” explored in this article is the mixture of admiration for and
criticism of Blake’s work found scattered through the writings of various members of the Bloomsbury group.
Roger Fry, of course, is discussed first (6-9), Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf follow (9-16), next come
Lytton Strachey and Leonard Woolf (16-20), and E. M. Forster’s references to Blake are discussed to round
off the study (20-24). A drawing by Doug Weston, commissioned to accompany this useful survey, shows Blake
surrounded by the Bloomsburians.</p>
            <p>100. Goslee, Nancy Moore. “Slavery and Sexual Character: Questioning the Master Trope in
Blake’s <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion.</hi>” <hi rend="i">ELH</hi> 57 (1990):
101-28.</p>
            <p>—After a brief summary of Blake’s three-part narrative in <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>, and
finding that the oppression Oothoon attacks in the final section “binds the daughters of Albion, not the
daughters of Africa or Antigua,” the author addresses the following questions: “Has she [i.e., Oothoon]
forgotten the horrors of black slavery in challenging the economics of the European marriage-market? Has Blake
made use of the rhetoric of the anti-slavery movement only in order to make it a special and hence subordinate
case of the oppression of women by male physical and institutional power? Has the discussion of visionary
perception in the middle of the poem shown the female victim a way out of her feelings of worthlessness after
the rape—or has it only confirmed that trap by blurring together the specific problems of race and gender,
by subordinating them to a paradoxically ‘universal’ metaphysical perspective?” (101). Goslee then seeks
for answers to these questions which, she thinks, are required “not only out of historical and literary
interest, but also out of our present need to understand the relationships among race, gender, society, and
subjective imaginative vision.” In doing so, she is well aware that this implies the risk of “destroying
an ideal image for our own romantic liberalism. . . . [It] seems more than ungenerous to attack his
synthesis” (102), and yet the deed must be done. Nancy Goslee’s critical procedure entails discussions of
all the more recent readings of <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>, but it is a critique of Hilton’s interpretation
in <hi rend="i">Unnam’d Forms</hi> (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 20 [1986-1987]: 82 [#105]) which supplies
the keynote: “Like Hilton, I propose to begin with an historically-based examination of the poem, and like
him I think that Oothoon’s rhetoric must not be read as fully consistent with Blake’s views. Yet I propose
to deconstruct not Oothoon, but the ‘master trope’ that subordinates actual differences in social
condition” (103). In conclusion, the author states that it is precisely Blake’s synthesis, his attempt to
arrive at an inclusiveness that merges “several conflicting pressures” of race, of gender, and of “an
enlarged definition of slavery that includes not only women but all humans whose liberty of desire and
imaginative vision is subordinated to a repressive religious and economic system,” which is to be held
responsible for turning the “primary evils” that are the subject of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters
of Albion</hi> into something “less vivid” (124). Maybe, however, it is not only “Oothoon’s repetition
of the hymnic conclusion to <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>” that “is ambiguous”
(125), but also the purpose and result of such critical analysis of poetic and pictorial synthesis. Goslee, in
any case, cannot be blamed for having been unaware of this critical risk of a neutralization of the poet’s
work.</p>

Magritte).” <hi rend="i">Iowa Review</hi> 19 (1989): 113-55.</p>
            <p>—The author is concerned with the evident “discrepancy between the qualities of the
pictorial and the verbal art” and argues that the “viewer who attempts to envision Blake’s ‘The
Tyger’ through any of [the] available mind-sets will find [her or his] pictorial expectations disappointed.
What I aim to show is that Blake provided a coordinated rather than a commensurate poem-with-picture. In
effect, all of Blake’s versions of this picture declare, without apology: This is not the Tyger imagined in
the poem” (113). Includes a useful bibliographic account of previous interpretations of the plate from the

Evanston, IL: Northwestern UP, 1989. $29.95 cloth/$12.95 paper.</p>
            <p>—This collection of the author’s essays includes (as chapters 11 and 12) reprints of his
“William Blake: Christ’s Body” (193-219), first published in the Keynes <hi rend="i">festschrift</hi> of
1973, and of “‘What Seems to Be: Is’: Blake’s Idea of God” (221-44), Hagstrum’s contribution to
the 1984 <hi rend="i">festschrift</hi> for Walter Jackson Bate. He there portrays “Blake in tortured
struggle ultimately fashioning an independent, fiery, and productive personality, not indeed against a
literary ancestor but more deeply against a religious ancestor, God, whom in the end he transforms into a
psychologically nuanced, humanly plausible, and artistically compelling father” (xii). In this book,
Hagstrum argues for “an inescapable continuity” of art and literature from 1660 to 1827, a continuity
which he sees as being “itself <hi rend="i">made up</hi> of contrast and conflict, often of an invigorating,
intense, and altogether fruitful variety.” Moreover, and “for both Johnsonian and Blakean reasons” (xi),
Hagstrum hopes that his reader “will find it illuminating and invigorating to ignore conventional curricular
and textbookish separations of the Romantic from the socalled Neoclassic and Augustan . . ., while at the same
time he confronts within each author discussed and each topic explored the inherent polarities and also the
consuming drive toward wholeness” (xii). Whether Hagstrum is writing about vision and the religious in the
eighteenth century, about vision and the visual (as “the imagistic, the pictorial” [xiv]), or about the
“distinctly erotic coloration” of the term sensibility, for him Blake always remains near at hand: “My
long absorption in the art and mythology of Blake has shown me that sexual energy was omnipresent, flowing
from word to design, design to word, and from one state of the human soul to another, being present with
conscious and corrupt perversity in Experience as well as being delicately and perhaps unconsciously present
in Innocence. It is also demonstrably present—vitally and centrally—even in the poet-painter’s
religion” (xvi). Even where he turns to the discussion of “the present taste for indeterminacy and radical
undecidability” (xvii) in current literary criticism—definitely not <hi rend="i">his</hi> taste—and of
“the dogma that language and its structures constitute a kind of fatality for writer and critic alike”
(xviii), Hagstrum will eventually single out the works of Blake to clarify his stance. Whether one agrees or
disagrees with the author, for the student of Blake the book as a whole has a lot to offer.</p>
            <p>107. Hamlyn, Robin. “Blake’s Fate at the Tate.” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 23 (1989-1990):
211-13.</p>
            <p>—Hamlyn offers an intelligent apology for the Tate’s decision to give up its former
“Blake Room” and to present, as part of the permanent exhibition, only a considerably smaller selection of
the artist’s works in Gallery 12. There, however, the display is to be changed “every six or eight
months” (212). Students of Blake will of course have access to the remainder of the Tate’s important Blake
holdings via the museum’s efficient Study Room at the Turner-Glore Gallery. It is to be regretted that this
article by a member of the gallery’s staff, while successfully calming down some partisan feelings inside
the “Blake community,” does not address the more general issues at stake. The undoing of the “Blake
Room” appears to be no more than the most obvious violation of the former, and by necessity always unstable,
equilibrium which used to guarantee the Tate’s proper functioning as <hi rend="i">both</hi> London’s main
public gallery for twentieth-century art <hi rend="i">and</hi> as the National Gallery of British Art. I
certainly rejoice to see the Tate’s collection of Pollock or Mark Rothko paintings exhibited to their best
advantage. Yet I still wonder whether and why the spatial price for this access to the additional exhibition
walls that have now been assigned to works of modern art really had to be paid by the historic British
collection. After the much-publicized and celebrated “new hang” at the Tate, this is presented in many of
the gallery’s larger rooms as if the museum officials had been attempting to create some eighteenth-century
period piece with paintings clustering on the walls in two or three rows on top of each other. I do not know
in which way the public at large has reacted to the “new display of the Collection” which was presented as
“Past, Present, Future” in 1990 (the Tate’s press office certainly told them that a new hang is also to
be considered a beautiful and an enhanced one). Being interested in the history of British painting (and quite
regardless whether my concern will be with Blake and his circle, with Barry, or Fuseli, or the
Pre-Raphaelites), I despaired when I found that in all too many cases the careful study of some of the
gallery’s historically most important paintings (if these happen to be still on view) has become more
difficult, if not virtually impossible, on account of their distance from the viewer, high up on the walls.
Blake’s works are generally on a small scale, and I guess that eventually we can all learn to live with
their new presentation at the Tate. The paintings for, say, Boydell’s Shakespeare Gallery are an entirely
different matter, and it is only here that the effects of the “new hang” on the research of the “Blake
community” become fully apparent. The Tate is not so much neglecting its duties as one of the most important
Blake collections in the world, but it seems to have forgotten about its responsibilities as the National
Gallery of British Art. The elimination of the former “Blake Room” therefore appears to be no more than a
symbolic act highlighting a tendency which threatens to seriously diminish the role of the Tate Gallery as the
single most important gallery for the study of the artistic traditions and the visual ambience that, 
<hi rend="i">inter alia</hi>, helped to shape (and now may help to understand) Blake’s art.</p>

            <p>—An account of the formation of the architect’s library which mentions, as “perhaps the

This refers to copy I-2 in the census of colored copies of the engravings in the Clarendon edition (ed. Grant,
Rose, and Tolley, 1980, p. 63) where its coloring was characterized as “generally dull.” The title page
for “Night the Third” is reproduced in color (pl. XII, 243) and I must say that to me, too, Soane’s copy
does not appear to be a likely candidate for the highly hypothetical copy from Blake’s workshop which might
have served as a model for Edwards’ professional colorists. Also, what is one to make of Harris’s mention
of Blake’s <hi rend="i">widow</hi> as a possible identification of the colorist of this copy? Obviously, and
maybe on account of the Tatham letter which is
<pb id="p25-23" n="23"/>
preserved with this copy, Harris assumes that after her husband’s death Catherine Blake may still have had a
stock of uncolored sheets from the 1797 publication ready at hand for coloring and subsequent sale. This is an
entirely new theory, I believe, but it will be hard to substantiate. Tatham’s letter of c. 1832, as reported
in the Clarendon edition, contains an offer to <hi rend="i">dispose</hi> of any Blakes that Soane may wish to
sell; however, there seems to be no mention in this letter of Tatham’s readiness to supply the architect and
collector with (freshly) colored works from the artist’s estate.</p>

            <p>—“A respectable canon seems to require all sorts of stories, including those that may cast
doubt on its validity (so to validate it more) by offering some kind of revelation of it or inscribing some
apocalyptic end, and including also a few stories that show the canon’s miraculous powers of openness to the
new, of saving what seemed lost. Our canon (such as and whatever it may be) seems in part to have answered
both requirements with the figure of William Blake” (134-35). The author traces the process of Blake’s
admission to this canon during the nineteenth century (see 135-41) and then turns to “our immediate
history” by adding “a consideration of what goals, what audience, <hi rend="i">what authority</hi> that
canon serves” (141). He maintains that the “high rate of interest in Blake” is due to the high
“‘semiotic potential’” (144) which characterizes Blake’s illuminated books, and at the same time he
asserts that “one cannot accept that Blake’s text has achieved its modernity by virtue of some private,
ahistorical commitment. It is, rather, the detailed reflection in that text of the social history, popular
tradition, and practical material relations of its time that makes it vital to our own concern with . . . mass
realities” (145).</p>

Enlightenment” on account of the role he played in the emergence of “‘typographic
self-reflexivity,’” a tradition which “links together instances where material signifiers—printed
type—draw attention to their material, printed status, and so call into question that central
epistemological question of how an ‘impression’ is made on the mind” (619).</p>

Religion.” <hi rend="i">Aligarh Critical Miscellany</hi> 1 (1988): 75-88.</p>
            <p>—In summing up Blake’s beliefs, Hirst refers to “formal contacts with the Anglican Church
. . ., his teenage views . . . were highly rebellious, at times politically radical as well as challenging
morally. [But then] came . . . an increasing disillusionment with contemporary Revolutionary movements. . . .
His contacts with [Swedenborgian followers] clearly also had important impacts [and the Greek Revival] made it
natural for Blake to draw upon Thomas Taylor’s Neo-Platonic presentation of Greek myths,. . . Hindu
mythology [did] make some impact,” and, of course, “Celtic and Norse mythologies also.” Yet all “still
rested upon a solid Christian basis” (85-86). While <hi rend="i">Prophet Against Empire</hi> still is very
definitely not among the sources for such an account, almost anything (else) goes. It seems as if some sort of
post-modernism by now has reached even the occult school of Blake scholarship. See also the subsequent

Position.” <hi rend="i">Aligarh Critical Miscellany</hi> 2 (1989): 186-202.</p>
            <p>—Offers yet another discussion of Blake’s reaction toward Swedenborg (188-91), William Law
(191-93), Böhme (193-96), Thomas Taylor (196), and Palmer’s High Church position (200), toward Greek as
well as Norse mythology (200). Convincingly concludes that there “is no doubt of [Blake’s] independence of
mind and refusal to accept any tight dogmatic creed. But his yearning for faith is equally evident and his
explorations into various systems of spiritual belief can be followed out to a considerable extent” (201).

experimented with a variety of approaches “to lure [science] pupils into the Blake circle” (25), sums up
her experience by saying that she has “come to expect less of [herself] as a pseudoscientist but found that
[she] can expect more of [her] students as readers of Blake.” Nowadays, she endeavors “to introduce
scientists to Blake’s <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> in ways that preserve the intellectual seriousness that the
students usually reserve for their chosen fields. By indicating a few points of contact of the sort [that is]
discussed here between thought processes essential to science and those engaged in a reading of Blake’s

            <p>—The author endeavors to solve an “apparent puzzle.” How does it happen that Blake was
drawn to the genre of the proverb, “traditionally the expressions of the prudent ‘wisdom of the many,’
of general truths that Blake often attacks”? Lansverk studies the Book of Proverbs, the 
<hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi>, the writings of Swedenborg, and “the proverbs in the prose of John
Milton, a prophet-poet whose use of proverbs is as paradoxical as Blake’s.” In these texts he finds
“important analogues of Blake’s Proverbs of Hell,” which then inform his “readings of Blake’s
works,” especially of the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Visions</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Four

they actually work against their form.” What is it then, that brothels are built of? Those interested in the

Freedom P, 1988. £2.00 paper.</p>
            <p>—While we “are no longer living in the blissful dawn which William Blake, William Godwin
and their fellow radicals experienced at the outbreak of the French Revolution,” and though the
“triumphant State has come to intrude itself into all aspects of society, into the innermost recesses of
everyday life,” there is,
<pb id="p25-25" n="25"/>
according to Marshall’s analysis of current world politics, still some hope for the “libertarian
alternative which offers a direct form of democracy.” And Blake, he feels, “speaks directly to this
growing libertarian movement” (9). It must have been the precepts of this movement which have governed the
process of selection for the material that was to be offered in this short monograph. Marshall’s account of
Blake’s “Life” (12-18), of the libertarian “Tradition” (18-20), of the dialectical nature of
Blake’s “Philosophy” (20-23), of his concept of “Nature” (23-25) and “Human Nature” (25-34), of
Blake’s political attitudes (34-37) and of his critique of “The State” (38-42), “The Church” (43-44)
and their combination in ideological “Mind-Forged Manacles” (44-50) has been custom tailored to suit the
author’s concluding opposition of “Existing Society” (51-54) and “Free Society” (55-67). On the two
final pages Marshall ends with a conclusion that is a message for the approaching “post-industrial
society” with its “free community of fully realized individuals” (67). The author has taken care to
repeat more or less this same “message” from page 9 onward, and in fact, throughout the book. What
Marshall wants his readers to believe is that Blake “is nothing like as difficult as his reputation might
suggest.” For that purpose the author has “discovered” for the uninitiated “the key” (9) to
Blake’s mythology; applying it to the treasure-vault, Marshall sifts out the phantom of Blake the anarchist
rebel. Personally, I sympathize much more with this figure than with the occultists’ Blake; as a
critic—and despite the partial truth I readily acknowledge to each side—I find both approaches wanting in
a similar way. In addition, I may be allowed to say that clearly, by streamlining Blake into just another
political pamphleteer of the crumbling left, an awful lot is lost (and even some of the best things that
Hazard Adams was able to incorporate into his “neo-Blakean Prolegomena” for a liberating approach toward
issues in modern education; see #39, above). Looking at art and reading poetry may and, I think, ought to help
in questioning one’s encrusted ideological prejudices, not to merely add some new affirmation to any given
creed. And that even if one’s political beliefs are as firmly rooted in the “libertarian tradition” as
Marshall’s unquestionably are. See also #189, below.</p>

<hi rend="i">European Romantic Review</hi> 1 (1990-1991): 75-90.</p>
            <p>—By reference to Coleridge, Edgar Allan Poe, Paul Valéry, Derrida, and Lipking the author
describes the romantic marginal notation as the advent of a new literary genre with its own canon (see 75-76).
In an examination of some of the “fourteen works known to be annotated by Blake” (76), McFarland then
attempts “to suggest rather than exhaustively to detail” (82) that, “curiously for Blake, but . . .
characteristically for marginalia as genre, . . . in these few books, and the even sparser notes in their
margins, the whole intellectual ethos of Blake stands revealed, if not in comprehensive detail then by
implication” (76). As “a synecdoche of good will toward Blake’s friend and sustainer” (80), i.e.
Fuseli, the Lavater annotations are contrasted with the “antithetic mode” of the attacks on Reynolds and
the “series of suspensions in mesothetis” (82-83) of Blake’s attitudes toward Swedenborg.</p>

            <p>—This slim volume contains a “Preface” (vii-xii), an “Introduction” (1-8), and four
chapters on Blake, Byron (38-64), Rossetti (65-95), and Pound (96-128), followed by the author’s conclusions
(129-34). It is full of suggestive insights and “originated as the series of four Clark Lectures . . . at
Trinity College, Cambridge, in February 1988” (xi). These “complete [a] project which I initiated eleven
years ago” (viii) with the study of romantic literature and ideology. Even today, Blake’s role remains
central in the investigations of McGann who, “out of Blake,” tries to show “how poetry is a form of
action rather than a form of representation, and a form of action for ‘Giving a body to Falshood that it may
be cast off for ever’ (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, 12: 13) . . . Blake’s work is important, in this
study, because it insists that poetry is not just a play or dance of language.” And its “importance for
the history of poetry during the past two hundred years” is seen by McGann to lie “exactly in the
resistance [Blake] maintained to the view that truth in poetry is ultimate goodness of fit.” Thus,
“Blake’s example sets the terms in which the present study has been cast” (ix, 4, and 6). McGann’s
attempt to show how poetry’s “acts of communication are transmitted in those codes of ideology (i.e.,
‘false consciousness’) which are deployed by poetry’s writers and readers” (ix) therefore begins with
a discussion of Blake’s preface to chapter one of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> and the physically mutilated
and “scarred discourse [preserved] as the opening of his text” (10). At the end of the chapter he points
out that, precisely because “much of its own message [has been] gouged from the plate [i.e., 
<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> 3]” (10), by “representing absence so dramatically, Blake admits the limits of his
work, admits the limits of imagination itself—in the end, even begins to <hi rend="i">imagine</hi> the
ideology of imagination” (36). After 11 years then, McGann’s critical project still makes absorbing
reading, and not least so because he consciously places his interpretation into the field where the
painter-poet’s own writings meet with “the three principal ‘lines’ of Blake criticism” (18) and the
various postulates attached to them.</p>

            <p>—McKeever uses “three texts—Byron’s <hi rend="i">Cain: A Mystery</hi>, Blake’s 
<hi rend="i">The Ghost of Abel</hi> and Coleridge’s ‘The Wanderings of Cain’—as a point of departure for
recasting the figure of the poet in the poets’ major works.” Each “respective poets’ interpretation
and revision of Cain’s biblical narrative” is here addressed “in light of ancient and late eighteenth
and early nineteenth century theological positions and assumptions specific to sacrifice and prayer, the
nature of God, the Fall and Original Sin, as well as literary concerns of the period. . . .” These materials
help the author to “explain how each of these writers construes Cain as a figure of the poet, the text as a
place of wandering, and wandering as a field of the imagination. . . . In each of these works the poets
demonstrate how various types of ‘sacrifices’ inherent in writing provide a landscape of silence against
and upon which a new discourse is constructed, only to be sacrificed in its turn. The poet, as a result, is
involved in a cycle of figuration and refiguration, writing and erasure, readability and unreadability, which
is constituted by a silent disjunction.”</p>

(1989-1990): 2909-10A. Texas Christain U.</p>
            <p>—Mead wants to show Blake’s “progression from the use of <hi rend="i">topoi</hi> to
dialectical oppositions for inventional devices in creating his poetry.” In order to do so, the author first
surveys the history of rhetorics and dialectical thinking, especially in the eighteenth century, before
turning to an analysis of “Blake’s four season poems from <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi>,” of
“the concept of dialectic and contraries in <hi rend="i">The [sic] Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi>
and <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>,” and a comparison of “the dialogues of 
<hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi> and <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> to those in Plato’s
<hi rend="i">Gorgias.</hi>” This comparison then “reveals examples of M. M. Bakhtin’s dialogic language
and Julia Kristeva’s nondisjunctive characters in <hi rend="i">Thel</hi>”—just slightly 
<hi rend="i">avant-la-lettre</hi>, and not really surprising in the work of a poet who (as should be understood by
now) anticipated just about everything that is and will be thought in the twentieth century (and, probably, in
centuries to come). The dissertation concludes “with a survey of inventional devices evident in Blake’s
poetry and possible avenues of further study.”</p>

<hi rend="i">South Atlantic Review</hi> 55.2 (1990): 15-31.</p>
            <p>—While acknowledging the important contribution made by typological interpretations to an
understanding of the <hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings, the author maintains that “exclusive reliance” on
this line of critical thinking “has obscured Blake’s presentation of Job’s three companions, reducing
their significance to mere unfeeling mockers, and losing the poignant sense in Blake’s own work that true
friends have betrayed Job.” Moskal’s essay therefore explores the “possibility that Blake may be
treating the companions in a more complex manner than has previously been noted.” It suggests that the 
<hi rend="i">Job</hi> engravings “may exemplify some of Blake’s conclusions . . . about the nature of
friendship and about the problem of discerning true friends despite their false conduct. Further, Blake’s
treatment of the three friends can fruitfully be seen in the light of his lifelong concern with mutual
forgiveness” (16). Using Blake’s distinction between states and individuals, the author examines the
“treatment of Job’s companions” in the engravings, addressing “Blake’s renewed motivation, in the
friendship of Linnell and others, to reevaluate the notion of friendship [that is, after his quarrels with
Hayley, Cromek, Stothard, etc.], and to test the rubric of states and individuals as a means to human
forgiveness” (20). For the general context of this article see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 23 (1989-1990):

            <p>—The author assumes that Blake as well as the English public of his times at large were well
aware of “Valmiki’s great epic,” and that therefore it “is not surprising . . . to find striking
parallels between concepts in Blake’s longer poems and the <hi rend="i">Ramayana</hi>” (211). These

            <p>—O’Flinn’s study guide to the reading and understanding of romantic poetry testifies to
the central position that at present (and on all levels of the study of British romanticism) are conceded to
the writings of Blake. The pages which the author has devoted to an exemplary reading of the “Nurse’s
Song” from <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (18-23) and of “The Clod &amp; the Pebble” from 
<hi rend="i">Experience</hi> (25-28) make up what “is perhaps the most important chapter in this book because in
it I have tried to offer a method for reading a lyric that will apply not just to Blake’s poems but also to
the lyrics of Wordsworth, Coleridge and Keats that . . . we shall be looking at in the following chapters.”
In doing so, O’Flinn has attempted to epitomize a “method” which “is designed to do two main things:
first, to provide the tools so that you can freely work on your own and are not condemned to reproduce the
opinions of others; and, second, to help you focus your study of a lyric on its main idea or feeling, giving
you in the end a clear view of the poem as a whole rather than a jumble of impressions” (30). O’Flinn’s
four-step method may indeed supply “a useful rule of thumb for directing” (16) inexperienced readers who
are preparing for an examination to a historically informed understanding of romantic poetry, and one will
appreciate the author’s insistence on an approach that “allows you to think freely for yourself” (29).
That much granted, some readers may still find it hard to put up with the chum-up tone that relentlessly marks

            <p>—The authors suggest a possible link between the “tears” of Blake’s stars and “a
well-known legend of the Perseid meteor shower . . . known as the ‘tears of St. Lawrence’” (192), and of
their “spears” with “the Great Fiery Meteor of August 18, 1783” (193). “The Tyger” is reproduced
from copy N in the Huntington, with a lot more red than in the original. The final paragraphs discuss Robert
and William Blake’s versions of “The Approach of Doom” (both illustrated) as “evidently visionary,”
yet “inspired by the historic bolide . . . with its luminous train” (194). See also the subsequent entry

            <p>—“This book began life as a doctoral dissertation” [vii], completed at the U of Adelaide
in 1985 (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 22 (1988-1989): 48 [#101]). It has since been revised, retaining its
fearfully symmetrical title. In a long introduction (1-33), Otto outlines earlier approaches (especially
Frye’s) to an understanding of “the voice of Blake’s poetry” (2); here he also gives an account of the
deconstructionist assumptions and the critical and terminological tools which he has used in his own effort to
“articulate” and “to give voice to what would otherwise remain mute and silent” (3). The ease (and
speed) with which Otto moves from the hermeneutics of Nietzsche to current methodological concepts of
deconstruction and back to seventeenth- or eighteenth-century philosophy and poetics is impressive to the
extent of intimidating the present reader. Otto radically challenges “the assumption held by the vast
majority of Blake critics that Blake’s apocalypse is a matter of perception and not a question of being”
(22), though he warns (as Blake himself might have done) against a simplistic attempt “to replace Frye’s
subordination of existence to perception with its mirror opposite” (24). Otto then explains why an
“investigation into the nature of Blake’s visionary construction and his visionary deconstruction is
therefore <hi rend="i">ipso facto</hi> an investigation into the character and identity of Los (loss)” (27),
and thus sets the theme for the chapters that follow. These are certainly good for intense and intellectually

IA: Iowa State UP, 1990. 141-60.</p>
            <p>—Peterfreund addresses Blake’s (and others’) “Problem with Prescriptive Thought”
(141-43), outlines the understanding of an “Homo corpusculans in the Eighteenth Century” (143-44), turns
to Blake’s understanding of language and its metaphors as “An Inspired ‘Stubborn Structure’”
(145-47), and then considers the poet’s “Ceaseless Mental Fight against Forgetfulness” (147-57). This
fight was meant to overcome the notion of “the void of Newtonian absolute space” (148) in an attempt “to
look within rather than without . . . to recognize the figurality of the ‘bodied forth’ world, as well as
to recognize the spiritual cause or origin of that figurality” (155).</p>

Control.” <hi rend="i">Studies in the Literary Imagination</hi> 22 (1989): 37-59.</p>
            <p>—The author discusses Blake’s emendations in “London,” treating the change from
“dirty” to “charter’d” and “the specific historical developments that provided him with a context
of response” (39), the meaning of “mark” and “marks,” the change from “german” to
“mindforg’d manacles” and the polysemous suggestiveness of the latter. Peterfreund unearths the
political and religious connotations of the standardization existing in Blake’s time and of the proposed
changes in these systems of weight and measure. He then skillfully uses this material to reconstruct a frame
of reference for Blake’s anti-authoritarian allusions to these mensurative standards.</p>

UP, 1990. 139-66.</p>
            <p>—The first part of this study pictures “an essentialist, totalizing metonomy” (140) as
“a figural strategy . . . that makes a totalizing form of reification possible” (141), and that functions
as the foundation for “the establishment of structures of authority in the name of the dominant ideology”
(142). Next, the author presents a couple of examples from the history of religion to show that “gnostic
texts . . . demonstrate how early and how astute gnosis in general, and gnosticism in particular, were in
responding to the metonymic move” (143). Using the example of Joseph Priestley and William Blake,
Peterfreund then demonstrates that “one particular ‘gnostic moment’ had a good deal to do with
establishing a dissenting position from which to mount a powerful critique of the dominant ideology of the
moment and the power relations underwritten by that ideology” (144). In his conclusion, he outlines the
“predisposing conditions . . . or defining characteristics” that he recognizes as active in each
“gnostic moment,” and which allow him to speak of the gnosticist critique of a given ideology as a
diachronic “cultural symptom” (154).</p>

not the author’s “purpose to make detailed pictorial comparisons for their own sake” as have been made
by the art historians (145, see also 140), that “Blake was not at all anti-Papist, rather the contrary, for
he admired the Roman Church as a theocracy” (155), and many other things they had not even dreamt of before.

in the mouths of Blake’s child speakers, means in themselves for pursuing a less coercive and one-sided
social discourse this side of utopia. Blake’s songs for and of children most directly engage the politics of
the age less in imaging forth a visionary or utopian alternative, than when they parody, dismantle, and
subvert a hegemonic discourse designed to impart a knowledge always purchased with the loss of power”

(1989): 33-44.</p>
            <p>—The author describes and analyses Blake’s ideas about an urban utopia. Contrasting
Blake’s Eden with his Jerusalem, the rural visions of the younger English romantics (see 33-34, 36, or 42)
with Blake’s insistence on a “preeminently social” millennium (33), Sanzo refutes the claims of the
“Gnostic school” of Blake scholarship (see 33-34, 37, or 43) in order to demonstrate the poet’s
commitment “to the task of involvement with the human culture and civilization which the city represented”
(35). For other discussions of Blake’s urban imagery (not referred to by Sanzo, and including one from a
member of the “Gnostic school”), see, e.g., <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 20 (1986-1987): 79 (#38), 82-83

International</hi> 50 (1989-1990): 2912A. U of Iowa.</p>
            <p>—Schock has studied the “representative works” and found (as others had before him) that
the “mythic figure of Satan looms large in the writing of Blake, Byron, and Shelley, and achieves prominence
in the work of many other . . . writers.” In order to understand this Satanic revival, Schock has examined
“the legacy of eighteenth-century English culture, in which the Devil lost authority as an adversarial
religious myth and rose to prominence as a heroic, humanized, and sublime figure.” In these “new or
renovated guises” Satan is made to act as “the image of an expanding consciousness, rebelling against his
limits and oppressed by the cosmic tyrant.” In Blake’s Orc—as he appears in <hi rend="i">The Marriage of
Heaven and Hell</hi>, in <hi rend="i">America</hi> and in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>—the author finds one of
the rare instances in which “the satanic figures . . . liberate and redeem,” while “all the others”
appear as more or less “unstable, ambiguous or negative mythic figures.” In conclusion, Schock states that
the “myth of Satan represents an abortive stage in the Romantic recovery of the projection of divinity and
in the revision of the story of redemption.” See also #67, above, as well as #232 and 248, below.</p>

            <p>—This dissertation “re-examines what have been commonplace prepositions for Blake
criticism.” Smith attempts “to show that, while we have agreed to place Los at the centre of Blake’s
anti-Cartesian argument, we have approached and expounded this argument with a critical discourse that is
shaped by, and, however unwittingly, promulgates the dualism of mind or imagination and nature. . . . we are
attributing to Blake the idea of an imagination-nature opposition, and interpreting his argument in terms
consistent with the assumptions of Cartesian discourse.” Not just Smith’s subject, Blake’s Los, but also
his argument appear to be closely related then to Peter Otto’s (for which see #153, above).</p>

            <p>—In his dissertation Sorensen attempts to demonstrate “that William Blake’s poetry
contains numerous significant, precise Gnostic ritual and mystic motifs, that Blake may have obtained his
knowledge of ritual initiation from Freemasonic sources, and that by means of the poetic genius he intuited
Gnostic motifs that scholars have become aware of only after Blake’s time.” To those who like myself feel
irritated by this news of a “Freemasonic” Blake from Washington State it will come as some relief to learn
that the author modestly hopes his “analysis will complement rather than replace other critical views
concerning Blake’s poetry.”</p>

(1989-1990): 1832A. U of Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>—In a very general way, one might feel that it is not without some justification that
Stemmler names as one of the lingering problems in the study of Blake “the lack of common interest, taste
and vocabulary among art and literary critics.” Arguing (from what seems to be an art historian’s
position, rather than the literary critic’s) “that knowledge of sources, content, and changes in forms and
iconography of a particular significant group of images, the image-cluster, is necessary for a full
interpretation,” she addresses this problem in a dissertation which obviously is intended as a case study.
“The image-cluster is comprised of the Silenus, sileni, satyrs and fauns. Traditional methods of art history
are used to investigate and track the pictorial and literary sources, form, iconography, and context of this
image-cluster. The image-cluster used on pages of <hi rend="i">Marriage, America, Jerusalem</hi> and 
<hi rend="i">Plates of Albion</hi> [sic] underlies some forms and the content of images and concepts of Blake’s
personifications Orc, Los and Albion.” This, certainly, is not expressed in the most elegant way. And though
it is a pity, I am convinced that such lingo (which is far removed from even the purplest prose of earlier
generations of art historians) cannot possibly be expected to serve its desired stimulatory purpose as the
“common

vocabulary” for literary critics and their colleagues in the art history departments. Nevertheless—and
being an art historian myself!—I do subscribe to a view that appears to be central to Stemmler’s argument:
“The visual images have their own language. . . . Pictorial evidence not only widens signification [of the
written text], but can provide weight on one side or another in the critical interpretations of Blake’s
major prophecies” (and <hi rend="i">vice versa</hi>). What seems truly inexplicable to me, however, is that
Stemmler wrote this more than a decade after the publication of a whole bundle of books and articles by
literary scholars such as Mitchell and Essick who have successfully demonstrated how the demarcation line
between the disciplines can be crossed without any loss of critical integrity. It is difficult to believe that
an author who has previously contributed to the pages of this journal and who is here attempting to reform
“Blakean criticism,” actually remains unaware of these studies. Mitchell’s study of 
<hi rend="i">Blake’s Composite Art</hi> or Essick’s investigations into the materials, elements and
hermeneutics of graphic meaning in Blake have long since achieved the status of tools that are absolutely
essential for the trade; and, together with some others, these authors have already gone a long way in the
direction that Joan K. Stemmler seems to have had in mind when completing her dissertation.</p>

            <p>—Stieg (whose name has erroneously been printed as “Steig” in the table of contents),
studies <hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi> in the light of eighteenth-century typology as “the exposure and implicit
denunciation of the false prophet” (273, see also 277). She proposes “biblical types,” in fact, a
conflation of “several biblical characters,” as “analogues” (276) that help understand Blake’s
intentions in creating a figure such as Tiriel. To buttress her thesis concerning the poet-painter’s
indebtedness to the biblical prophetic tradition, Stieg also draws on an examination of the “cursing gesture
made by Tiriel” (288) and various other figures in Blake’s oeuvre as an artist. The essay appears to be
the revised summary of about half of the author’s 1986 dissertation, for which see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>

Amsterdam, Neth.: Rodopi, 1989. f100.00 paper.</p>
            <p>—Tinkler-Villani’s study fills another gap in contextualizing Blake’s pictorial reaction
to Dante’s vision of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise by asking what “made poets and translators turn to
Dante and his <hi rend="i">Commedia</hi>” during “the eighteenth century and the first years of the
nineteenth.” The book attempts to shed “some light on the process by which Dante provided English poetry
with a mythology, and on the ways in which this mythology became intertwined with the Miltonic tradition in
English poetry” (1). To do so, Tinkler-Villani examines the theory and practice of eighteenth-century
translations in a case study of “Pope’s and Cowper’s Translations of Homer” (23-36); she then turns to
“Early References to Dante,” paying special attention to the Ugolino episode (37-58), and describes the
approach of “The Early Translators” (59-76), where she examines the important role played by the painter
and writer Jonathan Richardson. Hayley’s 1782 translation of the first three cantos of the “Inferno” is
here discussed in detail for the first time (77-106), and the second part of the book is devoted to the
English versions of the <hi rend="i">Commedia</hi> by Henry Boyd—whose “Historical Notes on Dante” were
annotated by Blake—and by Henry Francis Cary (123-238). Part III, though entitled “Integration into
English Poetry,” is almost entirely devoted to a discussion of Blake’s <hi rend="i">visual</hi>
“translations” of Dante. Following a “brief survey of Blake’s position in respect to the painters,
poets and translators who have played a part in the growth of Dante’s role in English poetry” (241), the
author first turns to the image of Ugolino and other Dantean echoes in <hi rend="i">The Marriage</hi>
(244-51), before discussing “Blake’s Portrait of Dante” that was painted for Hayley’s library
(251-58). A general exposition of “Blake’s Illustrations and Thought” (258-61) leads to a more detailed
examination of “Blake’s Illustrations for the <hi rend="i">Commedia</hi>” (261-88) and their position in
the process of integrating Dante’s epic into the Miltonic tradition. While Tinkler-Villani accepts Roe’s
and Klonsky’s studies as “the basic text” (261) for a critical discussion of Blake’s designs in pencil
and water color (here often referred to as “plates”), her study, too, participates in the current
revisioning of the hitherto accepted interpretative tradition that had been inaugurated by Yeats. Arguing from
a Dantesque position rather than from the stance offered by Roe or Klonsky, she comes close to some of the
conclusions that have recently been forwarded by David Fuller and Rodney Baine (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 23
(1989-1990): 131 [#73], and #47, above). “Blake’s illustrations to the <hi rend="i">Commedia</hi> are a
more faithful rendering of the original than people so far have acknowledged. A close look at the text of a
canto and, in particular, at a version of the text contemporary with Blake’s work (and particularly
Cary’s) shows that, in some of the instances where critics have assumed that Blake has deliberately departed
from the original, he was in fact following it quite closely” (285). Her compromise, which is more
diplomatic than it is radical, reads like this: “Blake produces a pictorial version of the 
<hi rend="i">Commedia</hi> which is, essentially, both an adequate rendering of the significance of the poem and
also a re-shaping of Dante’s narrative in terms of Blake’s own vision. . . . Blake achieved what so few
readers of Dante before him had managed to achieve—both a clear view of his own historical distance from
Dante, with Dante’s belief in the possibility of an ideal Church and State, and a clear view of the context
of eternity of the poem” (285-86). For additional discussions of Blake’s designs in illustration of the

            <p>—“Blake’s conception of the female as emanation, and especially of Jerusalem as the
highest form of love and liberty, is in many ways similar to the idea of woman as Shakti in classical Indian
thought” (193). Verma describes these similarities and finds that “the mythic constructs of Jerusalem and
Shakti are expressive of a pure and deep religious emotion, a mystical intuition in which the imagination not
only sees the concretized structure of reality but also verifies and sustains such a structure. To create
ideal perfection is to experience in the finite the infinite” (205). See also #148 and 177, above.</p>

Literature.” <hi rend="i">Studies in Philology</hi> 87 (1990): 246-59.</p>
            <p>—After briefly addressing Blake’s role in the “constant exploration, expansion, and
revision” of established literary genres during the late eighteenth century, Villalobos turns to the 
<hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> as a veritable “farrago of genres” (246). In an attempt to bring some order to the
text’s generic complexities, he then proposes to categorize the “Proverbs of Hell” as “wisdom
literature, or rather as a critique and parody of proverbial wisdom, a biblical genre that came under close
scrutiny in the years following the Puritan Interregnum” (247). To do so “contextually,” Villalobos has
studied “how eighteenth-century biblical critics interpreted Proverbs as the archetype of wisdom
literature” (248) and how they arrived at “a circular argument” (251) concerning the textual nature and
the religious function of the Book of Proverbs. In order to show how the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> can and
“should be seen as a satire, parody, and criticism of the so-called books of wisdom that were often
published in the seventeenth and eighteenth century” (258), he examines at some length the writings of
commentators on proverbial literature such as John Hutchinson, Matthew Poole, Thomas Scott and especially
Robert Lowth. They also supply the “contextual framework” (259) which allows the informed reader to “see
that the <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> is not as discursive or diffuse as it has been viewed for the last fifty
years” (259). For a complementary study of the function of proverbs in Blake’s writings see #130,

            <p>—This, I think, is an extremely important contribution to our knowledge of Blake’s
production techniques and the marketing of the illuminated books. While it is hard to single out one or two
basic “arguments” of the author, the article certainly raises some fundamental questions. Viscomi’s
investigation in the provenance of some of the illuminated books and his study of Blake’s technical
decisions and procedures combine to form an absorbing and heavily annotated narrative which is packed with
challenging hypotheses that, in my opinion, no one interested in an understanding of Blake’s choice of his
medium will want to pass by without further discussion.</p>

<hi rend="i">Dissertation Abstracts International</hi> 51 (1990-1991): 173A. Emory U.</p>
            <p>—Considering “the legacies of myth criticism” Wiebe asks for “a replacement of the
broad concept of Romantic mythopoesis, a concept of myth that works on a more limited scale. By thinking of
myth as a type of literature, as a mythopoem, rather than as a quality or essence that inhabits literary
works, it is possible to construct a model that has more efficacy for literary analysis. A mythopoem is
characterized by a world structure in which supernatural beings determine or in some way affect the human
world. . . . In Romantic poetry this mythic world structure is found in such works as Blake’s 
<hi rend="i">America: A Prophecy</hi> and Shelley’s <hi rend="i">Prometheus Unbound.</hi> Both of these works
create an urgency to interpret the supernatural
<pb id="p25-33" n="33"/>
beings as certain human principles or concepts, an urgency which is not present in other narratives involving
supernatural beings who are not encoded into this particular structure (for example, Blake’s 
<hi rend="i">French Revolution</hi> and Keats’s <hi rend="i">Hyperion</hi>).” In his conclusion Wiebe argues
that although the romantics “are interested in exploring intimations of the numinous, they stop short of
embodying these religious intuitions in the solid shapes of myth.”</p>

the composer of the music which accompanies the <hi rend="i">Masque.</hi> Since Wiles’s “study places
under one cover the multiple aspects of this eclectic masterwork” which was first “staged in 1931,” the

thinks that “we may, by focusing as does Nietzsche himself upon metaphor as the proper and necessary

Blake and Shelley, but also locate Nietzsche himself in the romanticism he too hastily rejects” (149). The

            <p>204. Youngquist, Paul [Bruce]. <hi rend="i">Madness and Blake’s Myth.</hi> University Park,
PA: Pennsylvania State UP, 1989 [i.e., 1990]. $24.95 cloth.</p>
            <p>—The author’s research was prompted by the observation that many of Blake’s “best
critics went out of their way to defend him against the charge of madness. Why this worry?” he asked
himself. “If it were so obvious that Blake was as sane as these critics ardently claimed, then why bother? .
. . Could it be that an artistic achievement as great as William Blake’s was born in the collision between a
sound mind and its pathology?” In addition, Youngquist found that Blake had “made madness a central
subject of his poetry” (vii), that he alone “allows the dynamics of mental distress to become a main
preoccupation of his poetry . . . Precisely because Blake made madness into myth, he avoided the fate of the
sensibility bards, but without resorting to the extreme mediations [in the representation of madness] of the
later Romantic poets” (viii). In this monograph then Youngquist seeks to discuss these two observations
which, he thinks, are intimately related to each other. In answering the questions raised by the theme of
madness in Blake’s life and work, Youngquist relies “upon a primarily empirical method for examining
Blake’s visionary poetry and experience” (ix), upon a “phenomenology of mental life” (2). This he
defines as opposed to sociohistorical as well as clinical methods. Examining the entire corpus of Blake’s
writings in an attempt to reevaluate “what that poetry is about,” the author throughout takes great pains
not to “incriminate the quality of Blake’s poetry” (13). And while he wants to demonstrate to his
readers “why Blake’s contemporaries dismissed him as mad,” he is careful in reassuring them that even
“if Blake’s biography reveals a potential for madness, nothing suggests that he ever lapsed into it, even
for a time” (16). Rather than to ignore both the contemporary references to Blake’s “madness” and the
functioning of madness as “a major subject” (3) in his “myth,” Youngquist wants readers of Blake to
“remember that his visionary art has its origin in visionary experience, which by contemporary standards
would be considered at least potentially pathological.” His study demonstrates how the “use Blake made of
such experience, turning it toward healthy ends through artistic activity,” can be seen as lending to his
work a “supreme importance [for] an understanding of the full range of human being. For madness confronts
our humanity with a profound challenge. Blake answers this challenge with a myth that defends against the
suffering it depicts” (168). There can be little doubt about the critical importance of the issues raised in
Youngquist’s book. And yet one may wish that the author had not only chided “certain post-structural and
Marxist methods of interpretation” for having “diminished the role of the artist in the act of creation”
(ix), but had also used some such critical method himself in order to investigate more thoroughly the
traditions behind his own epistemological criteria, especially that of “the norm of human experience.”
While Youngquist seems well aware that such a norm “is a slippery item” in <hi rend="i">any</hi> critical
context, and despite his references to Foucault’s <hi rend="i">Madness and Civilization</hi> or the insight
that the normative criteria he postulates are “not always identical with the historical,” he still goes
ahead in defining and in then employing “this human norm” (3-4) as a basis for his argument. One can only
wonder whether such a norm has <hi rend="i">ever</hi> been a historical reality at all, or whether the latter
has not always rendered the former obsolete, a void abstraction. For a related study, though with a distinctly
different approach to the theme of Blake’s “madness,” see #74, above.</p>

            <p>—Neither in scope nor in purpose can Denvir’s “Documentary History” (see also the
subsequent entry) match the riches presented in Dobai’s monumental four-volume account of the 
<hi rend="i">Kunstliteratur des Klassizismus und der Romantik in England</hi> that covers approximately the same
period between the years 1700 and 1840 (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 11 [1977-1978]: 106; 13 [1979-1980]:
93-94; 16 [1982-1983]: 118 [#186]; 20 [1986-1987]: 90 [#268]). However, saying this should not distract from
the usefulness and success of Denvir’s more modest endeavor. Arranged under headings such as “Fine Art and
Its Institutions,” “The Arts of Manufacture,” “Improving Public Taste,” “Patronage, Public and
Private,” or “Art, Design and the Machine,” readers will find a far-ranging selection from relevant
manuscript sources and published accounts. These will help the student to develop an understanding for the

centuries and will guide her or him

light to <hi rend="i">being in</hi> the light, to being seen by others, to recognition” (91). To address
this subject, Ferber draws upon the writings of Paine, Blake (90-91, 95-96, 102), Price, Burke,
Wollstonecraft, Gray, Wordsworth, and Hannah Arendt.</p>
            <p>209. Gage, John. “An Early Exhibition and the Politics of British Printmaking, 1800-1812.”
<hi rend="i">Print Quarterly</hi> 6 (1989): 123-39.</p>
            <p>—This study briefly refers to two early London print exhibitions, shown at the British School
in Berners Street during 1802-03 (126-28) and at W. B. Cooke’s house in Soho Square in 1821 (133). Most of
Gage’s article, however, is concerned with a descriptive account of John Landseer’s campaign for the
engravers’ academic recognition. This in itself is relevant to a proper understanding of Blake’s polemical
position in the quarrel over the status of engraving as one of the fine arts and over the hierarchy of
mezzotint work, the dotted manner, and line engraving. It is not surprising then to find that Gage’s
discussion of the “ideology which concerned the nature and function of the various categories of art, and,
within the engraving fraternity itself, a debate about style and technique” (134) ends in a critical
explication of William Sharp’s statement of 1810 and of Blake’s attack on the Chalcographic Society in his
“Public Address” (see 136-38). This discussion of Blake and the Chalcographic Society, well-informed as it
is, might still have profited from the materials published in Dennis Read’s article of 1981 on this same
subject (see <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 16 [1982-1983]: 115 [#108]). While effectively drawing on some hitherto
neglected material and on entries in the Yale edition of the Farington diary, the historical account as
presented by Gage had to remain a near copy of that provided by Celina Fox’s “The Engravers’ Battle for
Professional Recognition in Early Nineteenth Century London” (<hi rend="i">London Journal</hi> 2 [1976]:
3-31). I am afraid that it will soon be recounted for a third time in a forthcoming article by the compiler of
the present report that is similarly concerned with the battle’s ideological implications and which was
finished a few months before Gage’s study appeared in print.</p>

            <p>—In the space of a nutshell Gaull presents an interesting survey of “Romantic astronomy”
(35), ranging from Swedenborg to a Blakean finale (see 40-41). On a few pages the author covers the vast
territory of astronomy as a performing art during the second half of the eighteenth century (see 36-37), the
careers (and some of the major discoveries) of Carolyn and Sir William Herschel (see 37-38), romantic comets
and the extraterrestrial life debate (38), the nebula hypothesis and Erasmus Darwin’s popularization of
“what he believed was Herschel’s view of creation” (39) in <hi rend="i">The Botanic Garden</hi>, the
expansion of the sense of space and time (39-40), and the “silence and emptiness” (40) of the romantic
sky. All in all, this <hi rend="i">tour de force</hi> makes a useful addendum to the “Natural History” and
“Science” chapters in Gaull’s recent introduction on <hi rend="i">The Human Context</hi> of English
romanticism and is written with similar verve.</p>

G. Stonier. Just as in these earlier streamlined versions of John Thomas Smith’s 1828 text, the present
edition does not contain the Blake chapter (for this reason the 1929 and 1949 issues were not included in
Bentley 1977, which also ignored Edmund Gosse’s London 1894 edition of this important primary source for our
knowledge of Blake’s life and his working procedures). Yet even though it has here “been wisely decided to
excise the lives of artists . . . that have no direct bearing on Nollekens” (xiii), a decision which amounts
to no less than the suppression of pages 87-488 of volume 2 of the first edition, this reissue may still
function as a lively introduction to the artistic climate that Blake grew up and worked in.</p>

            <p>—As explained in a preface by G. E. Bentley, Jr., this is the first installment of a
serialized article on Du Roveray which is the result of research which Weinglass and he himself began as early
as 1979. The former’s biography of this important publisher of illustrations by Fuseli, Stothard, Hamilton,

bibliographical studies, including (as part III) “Du Roveray’s Artists and Engravers and the Engravers’

previously unpublished materials to describe Du Roveray’s acquaintance with those members of the Royal
Academy from whom he commissioned the illustrations for his books as well as his activities as a collector of
drawings and paintings (8-11).</p>

            <p>—This handy catalogue was published in conjunction with an exhibition organized by the Center
Gallery (24 Feb.-8 Apr. 1990). Visitors were able to examine Blake’s “Visionary Head of Canute” (9), two
of his engravings for Allen’s <hi rend="i">History of England</hi> and Stedman’s 
<hi rend="i">Narrative</hi> (39), and a copy of the 1808 <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> illustrations with a Fuseli
provenance that is now in the Paul Betz collection (42). Alongside these Blake items, Fuseli’s own painting
of a “Scene of Witches” and two of his drawings (20) were on show, accompanied by another drawing from the
Fuseli circle (21), which may have to be attributed to John Brown or the Master of the Giants (James
Jefferys?), and two Linnell plus one Palmer landscape (25 and 28).</p>

            <p>—Browne intended “to draw out some of the social commitments that underpin Erasmus
Darwin’s taxonomic poem” (593), and, as far as I can tell, she succeeded in elucidating the “vigorous
interplay between Darwin’s defense of Linnaeus, his commitment to evolutionary transformism, his thoughts
about plants, and wide-ranging views about society and progress” (594). Studying the poet-scientist’s
“idea of personification” (with references to Fuseli’s and Crewe’s frontispiece designs to 
<hi rend="i">The Botanic Garden</hi>) she not only finds that “Darwin’s
<pb id="p25-37" n="37"/>
pictures revealed that he believed only in nature, [alluding] to the possibility of a world without the
Christian church,” but also that in his writings “women were plainly seen as ‘natural’ beings, their
function being primarily reproductive, their behavior seen through a wide range of stereotypes that themselves
were presented as ‘natural’ roles” (621). While this hardly comes as a surprise, the detailed account
behind this conclusion is well worth the attention of anyone interested in “the ways in which gender and
views about gender relations were manifested in scientific practice” (594), at the time when Blake set out
to produce his <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion.</hi></p>

Wright’s portraits of Erasmus Darwin are discussed as #144-145, the engravings by Bromley and Smith as #P37

            <p>—A letter to the editor which—drawing on information in the Getty archives of sale

(New York, NY: Pantheon, for the Bollingen Foundation, 1962), this French translation of the Panofskys’
study of the “changing aspects of a mythic symbol” is bound to contain, as part of the final chapter, an
analysis of Flaxman’s pictorial interpretations of the myth of Pandora and her box. The most important of
these are, of course, Blake’s engravings after Flaxman’s designs in illustration of Hesiod’s

Troy, NY: Whitston Publishing, 1983. 15-37.</p>
            <p>—The first part of this second chapter of Allen’s book is devoted to an examination of
Goethe’s “Machtweiber” (15-24), while the second part discusses the use of erotic imagery in Fuseli’s
paintings as well as the painter’s attitude towards women in general (see 24-33). In the examples selected
from the works of Goethe and Fuseli, the author traces “a contribution to the synthesis of elements created
by later writers and artists. . . . [They all] provide some components of the femme fatale, they function as
prototypes for later forms. . . . The later image of the femme fatale is a combination of all the elements
suggested in these forms: danger, death, eros, beauty, demonism—and <hi rend="i">intent</hi> to destroy”
(33-34). However, Allen finds that while “Fuseli’s women are exaggeratedly erotic,” they are also
“prostitutes, or else victims of their own eroticism, mindless and will-less, more used by men than
destroying them” (33). Thus, as far as they concern the critical evaluation of Fuseli’s images, her
conclusions are downright antithetical to those of Kathleen Russo (see #251 and 252, below).</p>

Fuseli.” <hi rend="i">Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte</hi> 53 (1990): 89-106.</p>
            <p>—The article discusses (and reproduces in color) an oil sketch at the Art Institute of
Chicago which shows, on its recto, a color study for “The Oath of the Rütli,” and on its verso the
fragment of a female figure which is here interpreted as a representation of “Psyche.” The ingenious
author suggests that the material relationship between recto and verso is actually part of the artist’s
“meaning,” the “private” verso answering the “public” recto and <hi rend="i">vice versa.</hi> The
model for Bohrer’s entire argument is, of course, the similar neighborhood on the same canvas of Fuseli’s
“Nightmare” and the “Portrait of a Lady” at the Detroit Institute of Arts; there, the lady has often
been “identified” as Anna Landolt (with whom Fuseli had unhappily fallen in love during his last visit to
his home town). In consequence, it has been argued by Horst W. Janson (in an article first published in 1963
that has since assumed the position of the “standard” interpretation) that it is she whom Fuseli
“depicted” as the sleeping woman on the nightmarish recto while—in true voodoo fashion—projecting
himself into the role of the incubus. It is important and a real advance then that Bohrer, unlike Janson, does
accept the “public” status of at least half of the painter’s work in the oil sketch at Chicago. At least
one anonymous reader was so impressed by Bohrer’s simplistic opposition between public and private,
classicist and romantic modes of representation that she or he contributed an illustrated note on “Romantik
als Kehrseite der Klassik: J. H. Füssli” to the <hi rend="i">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</hi> (19 Sept.
1990: N3; signed “beil.”) which reviews Bohrer’s “convincing interpretation.”</p>

533. Exh. cat. Stockholm, Swed.: Nationalmuseum Stockholm, 1990.</p>
            <p>—From 10 Oct. 1990 until 6 Jan. 1991 visitors to the Nationalmuseum at Stockholm had a chance
to see a selection from the works of Fuseli (a few paintings and c. 80 works on paper from British, Swiss, and
Swedish collections) reunited with those of his Roman friend, the Swedish sculptor and draughtsman Johan
Tobias Sergel. Both exhibitions were accompanied by their own catalogue, and, in addition, the museum
organized a series of three lectures to introduce the two artists to the public. The Fuseli catalogue consists
of a general introduction (7-9), a biographical sketch (11-14), and a discussion of Fuseli’s imagery
(15-24), all by Cavalli-Björkman; these chapters are rounded out by a brief study of Fuseli’s drawings
(25-30), contributed by Ragnar von Holten, and an annotated list of the works on show (31-85) which has been
jointly compiled by Cavalli-Björkman and von Holten. Nancy Adler has translated Olle Granath’s
“Foreword” (5-6, 89) and offers a “Summary” of the introductory essays in English (90-95). There are
seven color plates and all the other paintings and drawings in the exhibition are reproduced in
monochrome.</p>

Berücksichtigung der Kunstlehre Füsslis.” M.A. thesis. U of Cologne, W. Ger., 1989.</p>
            <p>—An introduction, concerned with the position of British “literary painting” in the
eighteenth century and the history of Boydell’s Shakespeare Gallery, is followed by chapters on Fuseli’s
Roman sketches for a group of decorative paintings with figures from <hi rend="i">A Midsummer Night’s
Dream</hi>, on the painter’s reading and interpretation of Shakespeare, and on his conceptions of invention
and the imagination. These materials are then used to fuel the interpretation of form and content in those of
Fuseli’s compositions that have Titania, Oberon, Puck, and Bottom for their <hi rend="i">dramatis
personae.</hi> In a concluding section, the author attempts to describe the peculiar demands on the viewers
that are made by Fuseli’s treatments of Shakespearean characters, and to gauge the relation between
Fuseli’s interpretation of Shakespeare and popular literary tastes of the late eighteenth century. See also

the author takes another look at “The Nightmare.” Studying the picture’s context in the theory of the
sublime and its literary practice, Frommert attempts to reconstruct Fuseli’s artistic strategies, his
intentions, and the viewers’ response to the iconography and formal organization of the painting.</p>

            <p>—Item 1 in this catalogue is Fuseli’s oil sketch of the “Head of Satan” of c. 1790. It
is described by a lengthy quotation from Schiff’s catalogue raisonné, translated into English and revised
by Kashey only insofar as the material of the painted surface is concerned. When Schiff examined the painting
in the late 1960s it was “lined with canvas which . . . led to the conclusion that it was a canvas
fragment” that might have been cut from the lost painting of “Adam and Eve Discovered by Satan for the
First Time.” The work has since been restored, and during that process it has become clear that it actually
is an independent oil sketch for the head of Satan alone.</p>

M.A. thesis. U of Hamburg, W. Ger., 1989.</p>
            <p>—In order to define the intellectual and normative ambiguities of Fuseli’s graphic and
painterly exploration of the myth of Satan, Ollech first traces the iconographical tradition of the motif in
Christian art before turning to its Miltonic context in British eighteenth-century culture and to Fuseli’s
formal borrowings in antique art and from Michelangelo. The author then supplies a historical sketch of
Fuseli’s Milton Gallery which has Satan as its single most important character. This leads to a systematic
grouping of Fuseli’s numerous treatments of Satan as a hero caught up between the good and the bad, the
beautifully sublime and the horrific. In a second part, this unpublished M.A. thesis charts the intellectual,
ideological, social, and political contexts of Fuseli’s near 50 depictions of the figure of Satan by
reference to pre-romantic ethics and aesthetics, morals and politics. A chronologically arranged catalogue
documents the artist’s intense interest in this subject throughout his career. For other recent studies of
the same iconographical motif see #67, 174, and 232, above.</p>

            <p>—This is the revised version of a paper read at the 1988 Conference of German Art Historians
in Frankfort on the Main, and it concentrates on the implications of paintings and drawings such as
Reynolds’ and Fuseli’s “Ugolino” or West’s “Cave of Despair” for late eighteenth-century art
theory. The evidence of Blake’s letter in defense of Fuseli’s “Ugolino,” published in the 
<hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi>, 1 July 1806, is not mentioned by the author.</p>

of Greuze and Fuseli.” <hi rend="i">Woman’s Art Journal</hi> 8 (1987): 3-7.</p>
            <p>—Anyone familiar with the artist’s imagery will not be surprised to learn from Russo that
the “message conveyed by Fuseli’s paintings and drawings seems to contrast dramatically with the moral
messages and charmingly naive heroines of Rousseau and Greuze.” Similarly, however, it comes as no surprise
that the author, who seems to accept the characterization of Fuseli’s “misogyny” and of his sexual
obsessions as established in the work of Gert Schiff, sees Fuseli promoting “the same ideal and, in some
respects,” finds him encouraging “an even stricter code than his two contemporaries” (6). In Russo’s
view there is little room (or hope) for changes. Fuseli’s attitude towards women in his 1767 pamph-let on
Rousseau is basically the same as that in his interpretation of a scene from the <hi rend="i">Nibelungen</hi>,
executed in 1807; yet it is even worse of course, that “the powerful fantasy that captured the imaginations
and creative energies of these three famous 18th-century men long endured” (7). The present writer is not
quite convinced that the same “fantasy” is not with us any longer, and he doubts that despite “these
negative assessments” (7n25), Fuseli’s position can appear in a different light merely on account of
Wollstonecraft’s admiration for the painter as Russo seems to imply. But maybe Fuseli and his contemporaries
were the first to give “a body to Falshood that it may be cast off for ever” (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>
12: 13)? See also the subsequent entry and, for a different approach, #236, above.</p>

Contributions to the Study of Science Fiction and Fantasy 21. New York, NY: Greenwood P, 1986. 39-57.</p>
            <p>—The author is concerned with Fuseli’s “Nightmare” and “numerous other visions that
involve the same powerful, emotional approach to women and sex.” Russo states that many works by Fuseli
“pass from the realm of the erotic to that of the pornographic” (42), though no attempt is made to supply
either a modern or a historical definition for the erotic and the pornographic. She then turns to some brief
discussions of paintings and drawings by Blake (47) and Sergel (47-48), and by the Rococo artists Fragonard
(48-53), Greuze and Hogarth (53). Without much preliminary questioning of the representational status of these
examples of eighteenth-century “erotic art,” Russo concludes that once sex “is viewed as something
immoral and forbidden, its depiction requires and assumes a heightened tension and power. These complex
qualities ultimately find expression in fantasy, as the romanticized works of Fuseli, Blake, and Sergel
demonstrate” (56). See also the preceding entry and #236, above.</p>
            <p>253. Schaefer, Anita J. “The Shape of the Supernatural: Fuseli on Shakespeare.” 
<hi rend="i">Iowa State Journal of Research</hi> 56 (1981-1982): 49-56.</p>
            <p>—Schaefer’s short article derives from a paper read at a symposium concerned with
“Aspects in Renaissance Scholarship: Shakespeare and His Contemporaries” and held at Ames, Iowa in April
1981. On a few pages it reviews not Fuseli’s verbal, but visual comment “on” Shakespeare. The author
describes a few of Fuseli’s designs for the Boydell and Woodmason Shakespeare Galleries as interpretation,
not illustration, as “extremely inventive and only secondarily indicative of the script” (49). Schaefer is
fast to arrive at the following conclusions: “Fuseli’s imagination . . . owed little allegiance to
literary obligations in interpretations of supernatural themes. Fuseli deferred to fancy without much response
to formulaic prescriptions suggested by texts” (54). For this painter, she feels convinced, “anything was
allowable in his art; any notion could be shaped on canvas, the literary vehicle being medium for inspiration
rather than imitation. His inventiveness overshadowed any dutiful attention to character in [the] plays”
(55). In a conference paper, it may be permissible to ignore the earlier scholarly and critical literature on
a given subject. The author’s clear-cut statements, however, might have gained some weight if only she had
measured her own approximation of the distance between Fuseli’s “inventiveness” and his Shakespearean
subjects against what the artist himself had to say on the “Discrimination of Poetry and Painting,” on the
proper function of “imitation” in the process of “invention,” on “the moment of suspense, big with
the past, and pregnant with the future,” and on “the firm basis of the story, on its most important and
significant moments, or its principal actors,” in history painting. Though artists will seldom be their own
best interpreters, a critical examination of Fuseli’s lectures “On Invention” (not to speak of his
references to Shakespeare and the visual arts) would have helped to lend some historical credibility to
Schaefer’s subjective estimates. See John Knowles, <hi rend="i">The Life and Writings of Henry Fuseli</hi>,

            <p>—This dealer’s catalogue, published on the occasion of the Edinburgh Festival 1990,
describes and illustrates a selection of drawings by one of Fuseli’s friends and amateur pupils. Lock’s
indebtedness to Fuseli is evident in his choice of subject (Homer, Norse mythology, Shakespeare, etc.) and in
his attempt to invest his figures with something of Fuseli’s energy and eroticism. However, the stylistic
properties of Lock’s drawings reflect his lack of professional training in the arts. Students of Blake will
regret that Lock’s study of the “Laocoön” (#21) is not illustrated in Shackleton’s useful catalogue
which, to the best of my knowledge, is the first separate publication discussing the art of this interesting

her point when she terms this an “honorary membership,” she is certainly right in pointing out the very
limited influence of the few female members in the Academy). Kauffmann’s contacts and her friendships with
male colleagues such as Reynolds and West are, of course, discussed at some length. A catalogue raisonné

            <p>—This is a critical and annotated catalogue of Lips’s engravings that was published to

short Fuseli chapters may be the most interesting parts of the book. “Physiognomische Fragmente: Raffael,
Holbein, Rubens, Poussin—Mengs, West, Füßli” are discussed (111-22), and Lips’s outline engravings

Society 52 (1986). n.p. [London]: Walpole Society, 1988.</p>
            <p>—The entire 1986 volume of the Walpole Society’s annual is devoted to Sunderland’s
exhaustive treatment of the life and works of Mortimer. Besides a biographical account of Mortimer’s
professional career (1-118), it includes a catalogue raisonné of the artist’s drawings and paintings, and
of engravings and book illustrations by and after Mortimer (120-218). This is followed by a list of
“Doubtful and Wrong Attributions” (219-25), by a list of “Works Exhibited” at the Society of Artists
and the Royal Academy during the artist’s lifetime (226-30), by a transcription of Jane Mortimer’s sale
catalogue of 1808 (231-36), and by three indexes (237-54). Following the catalogues of the works of Fuseli,
West, Barry, and Palmer, Sunderland’s book (which, I believe, has been in gestation since the 1970s) now
fills another gap in our knowledge of the artistic climate in Britain during the years that saw the formation
of Blake’s personal style and iconography. The volume is lavishly illustrated with more than 400
reproductions which, however, occasionally are too small to serve any other purpose than that of an aid for
the user’s memory. Also, the catalogue entries are very often no more than brief notes, and the author’s
arguments for attributing a particular work to Mortimer, or for rejecting it from his oeuvre, are not
discussed. Sunderland’s approach is that of the old-fashioned connoisseur whose judgment is based on an
intimacy with the artist’s works that is not to be questioned and has no need for any attempt at a rational
explication of its intuitive insights. Where he finds what he feels is “weak draughtsmanship” (220),
“not altogether typical . . . pen work” (221), or “poor quality” (223), Sunderland is quick to reject
an earlier attribution and immediately thinks of contemporary copyists or followers of Mortimer. Though a
drawing may bear “a date of 1768, earlier than any of Mortimer’s dated drawings,” the connoisseur still
knows precisely what the artist’s work of this period must have looked like, and therefore he may state that
“the penwork is not sophisticated enough for Mortimer” (225). Of course, Sunderland may well be right in
rejecting each of these works; his method of attribution, however, has little resemblance to the requirements
of modern art historical scholarship. The “Doubtful and Wrong Attributions” pose another problem since
Sunderland’s list must needs be far from complete (as is the record of previous exhibitions, etc.). In the
new catalogue raisonné I have, for example, failed to trace six of the 114 items that had been assembled by
the late Benedict Nicolson for the 1968 Mortimer exhibition. Yet these minor criticisms are no more than the
quibbles of a notorious croaker who, all things considered, is also very grateful to Sunderland for his labor
of love. His persistence in the compilation of the catalogue and his introductory study of Mortimer’s
artistic development finally give access to the full range of the “Historical &amp; Poetical” art of a man
whose achievement and integrity Blake seems always to have held in high esteem.</p>

1990. £150.00/$275.00, 107 plates, unbound in cloth folders.</p>
            <p>—These are the very last of the facsimile plates and reproductions that were produced by
Trianon Press under the direction of the late Arnold Fawcus in 1978. An unknown but certainly very limited
number of sets has now been made available. The 107 plates in the present publication are accompanied by no
more than a checklist of titles, media, and (where appropriate) states. After the death of Fawcus, the
publication of a full text and commentary on the plates seemed both impossible and unnecessary to the
Trust’s executive committee because since 1978 (when these Palmer facsimiles were first announced by Trianon
Press) “further exhibitions and publications” have rendered the proposed texts “largely redundant”
(quoted from the advertisement in the <hi rend="i">Book Collector</hi> 39 [1990]). The quality of the plates
is uneven, some (especially those that are in fact illustrating Palmer’s etchings) are true facsimiles,
while others (especially some of the plates illustrating preparatory wash drawings and related paintings) are
no more than sadly marred reproductions on fine paper (see, e.g., pls. 2[e], 6[c], 12[h], IV, or XI[c]).
Nevertheless, since many of the artist’s annotated progress proofs for various of his plates are reproduced,
and since complete runs of Palmer’s etched works are not commonly represented in print rooms, this
publication may still function as a very valuable work of reference. Often, two or more states of a print are
represented; where available, Palmer’s variations on a given theme have been reproduced; one can follow the
artist’s working decisions in his marginal annotations; a final section supplies a collection of 11
portraits of Palmer (mostly by Richmond), and two (rather poorly executed) sample pages from his 1824
sketchbook to “illustrate Blake’s and Dürer’s influence” (iii). In addition to the facsimile plates,
36 numbered impressions from Palmer’s restored copper plate of “The Lonely Tower” have been printed to
accompany the deluxe copies of the present publication; these are now sold either separately at £150.00/$270
or, if ordered with the <hi rend="i">Complete Etchings</hi>, at £100.00/$180.</p>

<hi rend="i">Burlington Magazine</hi> 132 (1990): 795-96.</p>
            <p>—Palmer’s water color from a London private collection, here reproduced for the first time
(and in color), is described and, “because of the artist’s unusual astronomical accuracy” (795), dated
to 1858 (while Lister “dates it to 1859 without any justification” [795n1]). Also, and drawing on
Lister’s own edition of Palmer’s letters, Olson suggests that sometime between 1859 and 1861 the drawing
was in the possession of Alexander Gilchrist. The author concludes, rather unexceptionally, that with “this
water-colour, Samuel Palmer created a more visionary work in harmony with his earlier <hi rend="i">oeuvre</hi>
and joined the large group of nineteenth-century British artists who executed representations of comets, among
them William Blake and John Linnell, both friends and potent forces in Palmer’s art and life” (796).</p>

house was once the property of Richmond who had it “restored” by “his fellow Evangelical and
Academician, the church architect Ewan Christian.” Besides the changes that were introduced by the new owner
and his architect after 1870, Gradidge also discusses in brief “a delightful little glass engraving . . . of
a lounging figure with a sun or moon above, on one of the panes of a back bedroom window.” The author is
convinced that this “beautiful and surprising piece of glass” (125) must be considered Samuel Palmer’s
“Felpham Rummer.”</p>

            <p>—While Blake’s engraving of the Portland Vase is referred to only in passing (121),

            <p>—Though I have not yet seen these lavishly illustrated volumes myself (2289 illustrations in
black and white, plus 302 in color), I can—courtesy of Robert Essick—supply the following note on the
Blake-related materials in Reilly’s monumental history of “Messrs. Josiah Wedgwood &amp; Sons.” In
volume 2 (pls. 626-42) Reilly reproduces an unidentified copy of the catalogue engraved by Blake for Wedgwood.
Essick believes that the copy of the plate inscribed “Pl. 2” which is here reproduced (Reilly’s pl.
627), either is not by Blake at all, or has been entirely reengraved, with virtually all of Blake’s work
removed from it. The same volume offers a quotation from a letter of 1818, written by Josiah Wedgwood to some
“William Blake,” whom Reilly identifies with the poet-artist (see 39-40). This attribution ought to be
treated with the utmost care; Essick, who has studied the entire text of the document (which is now part of
the Wedgwood Archive at Keele University), tells me that it is “clearly addressed to a man of considerable
standing and possible influence who would seem the social equal of Wedgwood,” thus hardly to an isolated
reproductive engraver living, when Linnell first met him in 1818, “on the brink of real poverty.” For the
account of another somewhat dubious instance of Blake’s Wedgwood connection see #49, above.</p>

            <p>—It is Klein’s “contention . . . that Wollstonecraft employs prevailing middleclass
ideologies in order to forge a place for middle-class women, and that employment is ultimately a confirmation
rather than a denial of the dominant social structure.” If this “contention” is meant to buttress the
author’s conclusion about the revision of the more traditional notion concerning Wollstonecraft’s
radicalism and feminism, then the reader might want to pause for a moment. What exactly was “the dominant
social structure” when Wollstonecraft was writing? And did not the “middle-class ideologies” have a
socially progressive, rather than a reactionary, function in what was, after all, the <hi rend="i">ancien
regime</hi>? While the hypothesis of this dissertation may well have to be accepted for the reception of
Wollstonecraft’s teachings in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it could be argued, I think, that the
author’s irreverent but fashionably revisionist criticisms of Wollstonecraft have been made possible only by
hindsight, that historically they overlook the decisive role of “middle-class ideologies” in the shaping
of modern society (and, by-the-by, of modern feminism).</p>

            <p>—The Trianon Press Archive “includes manuscripts, proof copies, variant editions, design
work, correspondence, unpublished art works, maquettes, negatives, color decompositions, guide sheets and
stencils.” It was “acquired by UCSC in two massive shipments [from France] in 1983 and 1988,” and its
usefulness has already become apparent in recent bibliographical research (see #344, below). Some of these
materials were shown for the first time in an exhibition at the McHenry Library (5 Nov.-14 Dec. 1990).
Mirroring the history of the press itself and its close association with the William Blake Trust, facsimiles
of the illuminated books of Blake and materials used for their production were at the center of the show which
is here documented in a small, but finely printed exhibition handlist. An unsigned note on “Arnold Fawcus
and the Trianon Press” is followed by a “checklist of the published works of the Press” on four pages.
It was compiled by Julie Fawcus who, on the occasion of this exhibition, was honored by a special reception
and spoke on “The Trianon Press: A Triumph of Enthusiasm over Reason.” In addition, a series of four talks
was organized at McHenry Library (9 Nov.); it included a paper on “William Blake” by Mary Holmes.</p>

            <p>—“As the last years of Blake’s life were sweetened by the companionship of younger
artists, so must Kaethe Wolf’s last years have been lightened by the fellowship with Blake” (135). While
it cannot be said that this curious volume is making a contribution to Blake scholarship and criticism, it is
certainly packed with evidence for the “sweetening of life” that the artist’s and poet’s works have
afforded to “an extraordinarily vivacious, dedicated and fascinating” (xii) Blake enthusiast and Minister
of the Christian Community. Kaethe Wolf-Gumpold’s introduction to Blake’s life and work was first
published in 1964, and translated into English in 1969 (a new edition of this translation is announced in the
present book). In 1966, Wolf-Gumpold’s German translations of Blake’s lyrical poems, a project inspired by
Joseph Wicksteed, were published in Vienna. As Fletcher, a close friend of Wolf-Gumpold during the final years
of her life, explains in his introduction, it was a biographical manuscript originally written in German by
his coauthors which first made him think about a full-blown biography that was to reprint substantial extracts
from Wolf-Gumpold’s work on Blake. Fletcher writes about “William Blake as Portrayed in Kaethe Wolf’s
Book <hi rend="i">William Blake: Painter, Poet, Visionary</hi>” (1-20), Ernest and Johanna Rathgeber
describe “Her Discovery of William Blake” (see 43-51), and then a whole section of the book is devoted to
“William Blake.” It contains “Translated Extracts” from Wolf’s Blake book (63-65), “Reviews” of
the book (66-68), “Details” of the publication of her Blake translations (69), and the reprint of the
“Programme for the Celebration of the Bicentenary of William Blake at 7 Queens Terrace, Aberdeen, 1957”
(70-72); for some unknown reason an incomplete list of “William Blake Facsimile Publications” by the
Trianon Press is supplied (77-78), and the section closes with a note on “Benjamin Britten and William
Blake” (77-78). More references to Blake can be found in Wolf-Gumpold’s article “Frescoes in British
Cathedrals” (138-50), here reprinted from the October 1957 issue of the <hi rend="i">Christian Community
Journal</hi>; this is an erroneously titled celebration of Blake, concerned with “frescoes” only insofar
as readers are advised to use their imagination in order to “perceive with their mind’s eye on the bare
walls, in the most beautiful Cathedrals in this country, the illuminating pictures of William Blake”
(146-47). Most of the color plates in the book that are not in the anthroposophic crayon manner that is
typical of the followers of Steiner are reproductions of Blake’s paintings and prints (pls. 1-3, 6-7, 9, and
42-43) and of his portraits by Phillips and Tatham (pls.

5 and 8); in addition, there is a reproduction of D. P. Bliss’s drawing “Mrs. Blake,” in which the
artist is seen “sketching one of his visionary historical figures” (pl. 4).</p>

            <p>—Part IV of this collection of the author’s previously published essays is subtitled “Art
and Marxism.” It offers three chapters (originally published in 1983-85) that are devoted to an analysis of
the works of the poet, Marxist critic, and Blake scholar Jack Lindsay. Lindsay’s biography of William Blake
(1978) as the example of a “profoundly revolutionary artist” (142) is discussed by Smith as “probably
the best introduction to [Blake’s] life and art” (143). Lindsay’s indebtedness to the thought of Blake
and his approach to an understanding of the earlier poet is charted on 105-08, 130-33, 138-40. In the title
essay, Bernard Smith himself briefly comments on Blake’s “The Dance of Albion” (see 22-24) in the
context of a section on Adam Smith, Erasmus Darwin, Wright of Derby, “the new science and its industrial
child” (21).</p>

            <title>Corrigenda to Previous Checklists</title>
          </head>
          <p>Having either examined some of the items that had to be marked as “not seen” in previous
issues of this annual report, or having acquired additional information from secondary sources, which had not
been available to me when first listing the respective contributions to the scholarly literature concerned
with “Blake and His Circle,” I find that the following corrections are now called for:</p>
          <p>21#157: delete the asterisk and change the date of publication to read 1986.</p>
          <p>23#2: delete the asterisk—and see the review of this generally fine facsimile in an awful
binding which is listed as #367, above.</p>
          <p>23#4: delete the asterisk and, instead of “n.d.,” read 1988; the book’s price is c. $30.00.
As in the Keynes edition of 1975, it is the Fitzwilliam’s copy H of <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and
Hell</hi> that is reproduced in this Swedish pseudo-facsimile which, however, is <hi rend="i">not</hi> the
facsimile of a facsimile as I had suspected. Furthermore, Robert Essick tells me that he disagrees with Morton
Paley’s first impressions over the quality of the reproductions. Though the plates have been printed on
glossy paper, he finds them rather less marred than in the Oxford University Press version. After examining a
copy myself, I find several reasons to agree with Essick’s descriptive and evaluative statements concerning
the merits of this publication. Especially, it is Blake’s application of gold in copy H that is rendered
much more convincingly here than in the 1975 OUP or Prestel editions. However, readers should also turn to
Gunnel Tottie’s and Morton Paley’s account in the review listed as #424, above. This complains about the
“color values” that are seen as “<hi rend="i">generally</hi> untrue” (210; italics mine). I certainly
sympathize with the demands for enhanced “fidelity of reproduction” that inform such a statement. However,
this is a matter of standards, and it is only fair to observe that the book does not claim to be a
“facsimile” in the true sense, and that it sells at a relatively moderate price.</p>
          <p>23#40: the phrasing for Briganti’s lengthy title had to be corrected on the phone; this
resulted in a fairly evident typographical error; a space, of course, has to be inserted between
“dilinearsi” and “di una struttura.”</p>
          <p>23#49: delete asterisk and add the following information: “Ed. and trans. Francis Bourcier;
with a new introduction by François Rivière.” None of the original illustrations appear in this French
edition (which seems to have been conceived for its Chestertonian rather than its Blakean interest).</p>
          <p>23#107: I was suspicious about this entry right from the start; it now ought to be deleted from
the checklist. When I finally saw a copy of Lenne’s book, it was too late to cancel the entry, and it was
therefore preserved as the hidden joke of last year’s compilation. The author is neither concerned with
William Blake, nor with John Hamilton Mortimer, but with the heroes of a comic strip series.</p>
          <p>23#148: upon ordering a copy of this new edition of Saurat’s book, my French bookdealer sent me
a copy of the first edition (still available at F 110.00!). The Petit reprint, though listed in 
<hi rend="i">Les livres disponibles</hi>, may well be a ghost then.</p>
          <p>23#158: transpose the author’s initials to read “L. J.” rather than “J. L.”</p>
          <p>23#170: the final sentence of my annotation is certainly not true—Tom Minnick and myself had
actually listed Waxler’s essay at the earliest possible date, i.e., as #128 in the checklist for 
<hi rend="i">Blake’s</hi> volume 16; therefore, this entry is no more than a reduplication.</p>
          <p>23#234: <hi rend="i">Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society</hi> ought to have been
set in italics.</p>
          <p>23#245: delete asterisk; as early as 1986 this illustrated survey of Swedenborg’s life and work
was published “to mark the three hundredth anniversary in 1988 of the birth of Emanuel Swedenborg”—thus
a visionary publication in a sense. In paper covers the booklet sells at £5.25.</p>
          <p>23#265: delete asterisk; the book’s first chapter (1-17) is concerned with “The Myth of
Poetry: Beginnings and Blake.”</p>
          <p>23#311: the cross-reference ought to read “[22#44],” instead of “[22#144].”</p>
          <p>23#326(4): still not seen, but author’s name may have to be corrected to read Willard
Spiegelmann.</p>
          <p>23#368: <hi rend="i">Comparative Literature</hi> ought to have been set in italics.</p>
          <p>23#369(4): still not seen; however, according to <hi rend="i">RMB for 1988</hi> (1989), this
review may appear on pages 187-88 rather than on 186-87 as had been stated in last year’s checklist.</p>
          <p>23#397(4): delete asterisk; the reviewer’s full name is Timothy Baker Shutt.</p>
