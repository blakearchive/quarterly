                    <p>Bucknell is now offering a student-initiated course on Blake. Last fall two students
decided they wanted to study Blake’s poetry more systematically than they had been able to do on their own.
They approached ten other students and seven faculty members—four in the English Department, two in the
History Department, and one in the Philosophy Department—all of whom agreed to participate in a
semester-length seminar. The students, who are receiving credit for an Independent Projects course in the
English Department, have handled the administration and organization of the course. The faculty members, who
are receiving no teaching credit for the course, are learning to appreciate, among other things, the ironies
of the first of the Proverbs of Hell: “In seed time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy.”</p>
