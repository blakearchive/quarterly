			<title>The following emendations have been made to all issues in this digital
				edition:</title>
		</head>
		<p>Whenever possible, the halftone images that appeared in the print edition of 
			<hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> have been replaced with 
			full-color JPEG images color-corrected by the editors and staff of the 
			William Blake Archive. Where color images are not available, halftone images 
			from the print journal have been scanned and incorporated into this digital edition.</p>
		<p>When an image that appears in this digital edition of <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated
				Quarterly</hi> also appears in the William Blake Archive, the image caption includes
			a link to the relevant digital edition at www.blakearchive.org.</p>
		<p>Most images in the print edition include location designations: “above,” “below,” “facing
			page,” etc. In this digital edition all images appear inline and centered, with captions
			immediately beneath the images. Location designations have thus been removed.</p>
		<p>The print edition often included cover images of books reviewed. In most cases these
			images have not been retained in this digital edition.</p>
		<p>Advertisements that appeared in the print edition have not been reproduced in this
			digital edition.</p>
		<p>Notes which appeared as footnotes or endnotes in the print edition have been rendered as
			marginal notes in this digital edition.</p>
		<p>In the print edition, an entire issue is a unit, with frontmatter and articles
			occasionally overlapping one another. The digital edition has divided issues into
			individual articles, with table of contents and frontmatter separate. Occasionally the
			digital edition separates overlapping material, such that an article may (for instance)
			appear to skip pages because the intervening pages were filled with other articles.</p>
		<p>In the print edition, some tables of contents list multiple entries on a single line. In
			many cases, line breaks have been added between entries for ease of navigation.</p>
		<p>In the print edition, words are sometimes split and hyphenated at line breaks or page
			breaks. In the digital edition, the word is represented undivided and without a hyphen,
			appearing before the page break if split at a page break.</p>
		<p>Some characters have been standardized. Where a straight double quotation mark (") has
			been used to represent inches, seconds, or “ditto,” it has been changed to the double
			prime symbol (″), the standard ditto mark and symbol for inches or seconds. In all other
			cases, straight double quotation marks ("") have been changed to curved double quotation
			marks (“”). Where a straight apostrophe (') has been used to represent feet or minutes,
			it has been changed to the prime symbol (′), the standard symbol for feet or minutes. In
			all other cases, straight apostrophes (') and straight single quotation marks ('') have
			been changed to curved apostrophes (’) and curved single quotation marks (‘’). Double
			hyphens used as dashes (--) have been changed to em dashes (—). Where a lowercase X (x)
			has been used as a dimension sign, it has been changed to the standard dimension sign
			(×).</p>
		<p>The editors of this digital edition have made no effort to confirm the accuracy of URLs,
			email addresses, or mailing addresses, which have been reproduced just as they appeared
			in the print edition and may be incorrect or out of date.</p>
