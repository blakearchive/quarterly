          <p>Convenor: Michael Phillips</p>
          <p>“The Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies, in the historic King’s Manor in the city of York,
is offering this new oneyear MA program featuring a core course on William Blake which also incorporates an
introduction to the major archives in Great Britain for primary research in the eighteenth century. A wide
selection of optional courses in the long eighteenth century is also offered to supplement this new MA. The
program is also available over two years to parttime students.</p>
          <p>“Blake is the central figure of the core course, as poet, painter and printmaker and as
publisher of his own works. In this regard emphasis is upon the immediate cultural and historical
circumstances that affected the creation and publication of his works. This includes study of the response in
Britain to the French Revolution and its aftermath, especially the era of the anti-Jacobin Terror and the
crisis it occasioned in the history of civil liberty.</p>
          <p>“A feature of this new MA is its introduction to the principal archives in Britain for original
research in the eighteenth century including collections of Blake and his contemporaries. Time will also be
spent in a printmaking studio to see and practice first hand how Blake’s works were produced.</p>
          <p>“For a brochure and full descriptions of the Centre’s MA and doctoral programs, write or
email Clare Bond at The Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies, University of York, The King’s Manor, York
Y01 7EP, England; email cecsl.york.ac.uk. Our website, http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/cecs gives full details
