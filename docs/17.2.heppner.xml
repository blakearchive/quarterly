          <p>In a letter to Dr. Trusler of 16 August 1799, Blake writes that “I find more &amp; more my
Style of Designing is a Species by itself.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n1"
type="note">1</ref> The context of that remark is Blake’s description of the process by which he starts from
a text or subject, in this case Trusler’s request for a painting to illustrate Malevolence, and arrives at a
finished design. This essay is an exploration of that process as it reveals itself in a watercolor Blake drew
for his friendly patron Thomas Butts in or around 1805, <hi rend="i">The Woman Taken in Adultery</hi>, now in
the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (illus. 1). I have chosen this particular design both because it originates in
a well-known text, and because it shows a text about to be inscribed into the design itself; it thus offers a
rich field for an exploration of the multiple relationships between text and design in Blake’s practice as
an inventor of significant images. <note id="n1"><hi rend="s">1</hi> G. Keynes, ed., <hi rend="i">The Complete

          <p>The design known as <hi rend="i">The Woman Taken in Adultery</hi> has no title that can be traced
to Blake, and is not referred to in the artist’s accounts with Butts, but obviously illustrates the story
told in John 8:1-11, which I quote here in the Authorized text:
<list type="ordered">
	<item><p><label>1</label> Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</p></item>
	<item><p><label>2</label> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came
unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</p></item>
	<item><p><label>3</label> And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when
they had set her in the midst,</p></item>
	<item><p><label>4</label> They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very
act.</p></item>
	<item><p><label>5</label> Now Moses in the Law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest
thou?</p></item>
	<item><p><label>6</label> This they said tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped
down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</p></item>
	<item><p><label>7</label> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He
that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</p></item>
	<item><p><label>8</label> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</p></item>
	<item><p><label>9</label> And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by
one, beginning at the oldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the
midst.</p></item>
	<item><p><label>10</label> When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her,
Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</p></item>
	<item><p><label>11</label> She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go,
and sin no more.</p></item>
</list></p>
          <p>This apparently simple story has in fact a rather complex structure: everyone involved in it is
on trial in one way or another. The intent of the scribes and Pharisees in setting up the situation is to
tempt Jesus “that they might have to accuse him,” the accusation of the woman being an attempt to trap
Jesus into direct confrontation with the Mosaic Law. Jesus’s challenge to the accusers can be construed as
the <hi rend="i">peripeteia</hi> in his own trial, by virtue of which he is freed and the accusers in turn
become the accused, leaving “convicted by their own conscience.” The words of Jesus to the woman define
the moment of <hi rend="i">peripeteia</hi> in the third trial, that of the woman, which is effectively
declared a mistrial by the failure of anyone to appear in the roles of accuser or judge. Not surprisingly,
these two dramatic moments of reversal become the focal points in the iconographic history of the episode, as
Louis Réau suggests when he sums up that history as consisting of two main branches, one showing Jesus
bending down to write the words “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her,” and
the second showing the woman kneeling in tears before an upright Jesus.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n2" type="note">2</ref> The development of this complex history is worth looking at in
some detail. <note id="n2"><hi rend="s">2</hi> Louis Réau, <hi rend="i">Iconographie de l’art
chrétien</hi>, II.ii (Paris: Presses universitaires de France, 1957), 324-25. I have found no full-scale
treatment of the iconography of the theme, but there is a useful discussion in Otto Schmitt, 
<hi rend="i">Reallexikon zur Deutschen Kunst-Geschichte</hi>, IV (Stuttgart: Alfred Druckenmueller Verlag, 1958),
columns 792-803. Also useful for lists of versions of the theme are Gertrud Schiller, <hi rend="i">Iconography
of Christian Art</hi>, trans. Janet Seligman, I (London: Lund Humphries, 1971), 160-61, and Andor Pigler, 
<hi rend="i">Barockthemen</hi> (Budapest: Verlag der Ungarischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1956), I,
309-14.</note></p>
          <p>The first known European versions, which follow a few very early Syro-Egyptian pyxes, fall into
one or other of the two patterns described by Réau. An example of the first is the Codex Aureus of c. 870
which shows Jesus bowing before the woman and pointing at the words “Si Quis Sine Peccato.” An example of
the second is a fresco of c. 800 at Müstair which shows Jesus seated and pointing upwards with one hand while
with the other he blesses and forgives the woman. A little later come several versions which illustrate both
key moments in the narrative. Some do this by means of distinct and successive images, while a mosaic at
Monreale of c. 1190, though presenting only one image, combines both episodes: Jesus looks down and points
with one hand to the ground in allusion to his written words, while with the other he absolves the woman.</p>
          <p>The subject is rare in Gothic art, and makes a substantial return only with Michael Pacher’s
altar painting of 1481, which has similarities with the Monreale
<pb id="p17-45" n="45"/>
fresco just described. The episode is then taken up by other artists, with Titian, Rocco Marconi, and Lucas
Cranach (illus. 2) all painting versions early in the sixteenth century. The last two follow Titian in showing
the participants in relative closeup, allowing detailed observation of facial expressions; the focus of
interest shifts from the level of theology to that of human debate.</p>
          <p>This balanced and humane perspective is soon replaced by more overtly dramatic structures. Giulio
Romano, for instance, in a painting which Blake probably saw, reproduced here in an engraving by Diana Ghisi
(illus. 3),<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n3" type="note">3</ref> shows Jesus and the woman
in a moment of quiet and tender communion, visually isolated by two sinuous columns from the accusers who rush
away on both sides in animated, angry discussion, and threaten to trample the overlooked beggars in their
path. Tintoretto went even further in the direction of heightening the visual drama. In one of his versions he
has added the naked and youthful respondent, who is dragged in by a figure who must be the wronged wife;
opposite the respondent is a kneeling and naked older man, probably the wronged husband; in between stands the
richly attired adulteress. <note id="n3"><hi rend="s">3</hi> The design is said to be 
“<hi rend="i">D’après Jules Romain</hi>” in A. Bartsch, <hi rend="i">Le Peintre Graveur</hi>, XV (Leipzig:
J.A. Barth, 1867), 434, but it is not referred to in F. Hartt, <hi rend="i">Giulio Romano</hi>, 2 vols. (New
Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1958). It is presumably the painting that Blake would have seen at the Truchsessian
Gallery—see M.D. Paley, “The Truchsessian Gallery Revisited,” <hi rend="i">SiR</hi>, 16 (1977),
168.</note></p>
          <p>The decrees of the Council of Trent, made known during the years up to and including 1563,
demanded a clarity and faithfulness to the text which ensured that there would be no repetition of
Tintoretto’s nude respondent. These demands may well be reflected in the striking grisaille painted by
Pieter Bruegel in 1565, reproduced here from an engraving by P. Perret dated 1579 (illus. 4).<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> This returns to the early tradition of showing
Jesus writing on the ground the words “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone,” but
the words are now in the vernacular. As Jesus writes he is watched by a wonderful variety of faces that belong
to apostles, soldiers, and working people. The new message has become available to all, but many hurry by in
pursuit of their daily lives. <note id="n4"><hi rend="s">4</hi> Bruegel has been identified as everything from
Catholic to Anabaptist, but was most probably Catholic in the vein of Erasmus; see, e.g., W. Stechow, 
<hi rend="i">Pieter Bruegel The Elder</hi> (NY: Abrams, 1968), and B. Claessens and J. Rousseau, <hi rend="i">Our
Bruegel</hi> (Antwerp: Mercatorfonds, 1969). For this engraving, see H.A. Klein, <hi rend="i">Graphic Worlds
of Peter Bruegel The Elder</hi> (NY: Dover, 1963), pp. 271-72.</note></p>
          <p>The decrees of the Council of Trent are also reflected in the allegorical treatment by
Allessandro Allori, which mirrors the human interaction between Jesus and the woman by showing an angel
descending with a pair of scales and a sword, representing the justice of God’s Law, while a 
<hi rend="i">putto</hi> seizes the angel’s sword hand to represent love and mercy controlling mere justice.
Another sober version is that by Agostino Carracci, made at the very end of the sixteenth century and
reproduced here from an engraving by Blake’s business rival, Bartolozzi (illus. 5). The atmosphere is one of
deep thought, in which texts are pointed at and brought to bear upon the patiently standing woman. This battle
of texts will find distant echoes in Blake’s version, as we shall see.</p>
          <p>In the seventeenth century there is a Rubens based on the version by Titian, and a magnificent
Rembrandt which is unique in its approach to the story (illus. 6). Here the human figures are dwarfed by the
setting, which carries much of the significance of the design. The central conflict is between Jesus, barefoot
and dressed in a simple smock, and the High Priest of the Temple, resplendent in a huge throne raised in a
dazzle of gold high above the floor where Jesus dispenses his new and different morality.<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n5" type="note">5</ref> I think Blake, in an appropriate mood, might
have admired the basic invention, but the emphasis on the setting itself is quite alien to Blake’s art.
<note id="n5"><hi rend="s">5</hi> For the suggestion that Rembrandt in this painting was influenced by
Mennonite doctrine, see Jakob Rosenberg, <hi rend="i">Rembrandt</hi> (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1948),
I, 109-12, and the further references there which suggest, very tentatively, a possible link between Rembrandt
and Boehme.</note></p>
          <p>In another, more central seventeenth century tradition, stands Poussin’s version (illus. 7,
reproduced from an engraving by F. Chereau). The critics of the later part of the century described history
painting by comparing it with “a Tragedy or Epick Poem,”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n6" type="note">6</ref> and there is indeed a theatrical aspect to Poussin’s painting. The
architectural setting could almost be a stage set with a perspective backdrop<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> if it were not for the strong lighting from the left, and all
the figures, with one exception, are well to the front. The moment chosen is the <hi rend="i">peripeteia</hi>
in which the accusers retreat before the challenge of Jesus’s written words, and the visual drama of the
scene lies in the contrast between the serenity of Jesus, who points to both the woman and his new text, and
the angular gestures and angry brows of the would-be accusers. In the middle distance, in the charged space
between Jesus and the adulteress stands a woman with her baby, calm and unexplained, setting up a resonant
tension between the relationships created by the dramatic situation and those created by juxtaposition on the
surface of the painting. <note id="n6"><hi rend="s">6</hi> See R. W. Lee, <hi rend="i">Ut Pictura Poesis: The
Humanistic Theory of Painting</hi> (NY: Norton, 1967), p. 16, for comments by Bellori. The brief quotation
comes from Shaftesbury’s <hi rend="i">Notes of the Historical Draught or Tablature of the Judgment of
Hercules</hi> (1713), excerpted in E.G. Holt, ed., <hi rend="i">A Documentary History of Art</hi>, II (Garden
City, NY: Doubleday Anchor, 1958), p. 258.</note>
	<note id="n7"><hi rend="s">7</hi> Cf. the comments by A. Blunt, <hi rend="i">Nicolas Poussin</hi> (NY:
Pantheon, 1967), p. 260.</note></p>
          <p>The episode was common in eighteenth century painting, often in softened forms. D. Tiepolo gives
a spacious architectural setting to the animated soldiers and accusers, some of whom have upraised arms, while
ominous stones lie nearby. But his handling of Jesus and the woman is uncomfortably sweet when compared with
Poussin’s rendering. In the third quarter of the century, J.C. Seekatz, B. Altomonte, and U. Gandolfi all
show Jesus stooping down to write before the woman, who in the versions of Seekatz and Gandolfi is half naked
and has her head turned away in repentant shame. In these versions there is a shift towards a sentimental
treatment of the story of the fallen woman which is reminiscent of the episode between Mr. Harley and the
harlot in Mackenzie’s <hi rend="i">The Man of Feeling.</hi></p>
          <p>This overview takes us up to Blake’s time, though there is one more version, almost exactly
contemporary with Blake, that I shall discuss later in this essay. One can perhaps summarize the iconographic
history of the episode by suggesting a general shift from doctrine to drama to sentiment. Somewhere in the
period pointed at by the second of these terms Richardson commented on the episode in some detail, and that
commentary affords a useful bridge between iconographic history and a consideration of just how Blake went
about inventing his own version of the story.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Richardson included an analysis of the episode in his discussion of “Invention” in
<hi rend="i">An Essay on the Theory of Painting.</hi><supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n8"
type="note">8</ref> This analysis offers an excellent approach to the manner in which the period understood
the term. He does not mention any specific names, but would appear to have such versions as those by Carracci
and Poussin in mind. Richardson discusses the story to illustrate the argument that the painter of histories
must choose “<hi rend="i">one single point of Time</hi>,”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n9" type="note">9</ref> and shows an acute awareness of the role of narrative in history painting. The
development of the argument makes it clear that he is interested in dramatic expressiveness rather than
theological implication. <note id="n8"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Jonathan Richardson, <hi rend="i">An Essay on the
Theory of Painting</hi>, with note by W. Woodfield (1725; facsim. rpt. Menston, Yorkshire: Scolar, 1971), pp.
53-55. The essay was first published in 1715; the facsimile is of the second edition. There is a similar
analysis of the possible versions of an episode in Shaftesbury’s <hi rend="i">Notion of the Historical
Draught or Tablature of the Judgment of Hercules</hi>: see E. G. Holt, <hi rend="i">A Documentary History of
Art</hi>, II, 249-50.</note>
	<note id="n9"><hi rend="s">9</hi> Richardson, p. 53.</note></p>
          <p>Richardson’s analysis proposes four points at which the story could be intersected in order to
afford a possible subject for the painter. The first is the act of “the Scribes and Pharisees accusing her
[the woman] to our Lord”; this is rejected because it makes the Scribes and Pharisees, and not Jesus, into
the chief actors. The second possible moment is that showing “our Lord writing on the Ground,” but that
also is rejected, because “stooping down, and writing on the Ground makes not so graceful, and noble an
Appearance as even the Former would have done”; Richardson wants a noble hero involved in an expressive and
decorous action. The fourth possible moment is that of the pronouncement of Jesus’s “Absolution, 
<hi rend="i">Go thy way, Sin no more.</hi>” This would give him his decorous action—he calls it “the
principal Action, and of the most Dignity in the whole Story”—but this moment is rejected because it would
show only Jesus and the woman: “the Scene would be disfurnished.”</p>
          <p>This leaves the third possible moment, “Jesus pronouncing the last of the Words, 
<hi rend="i">Let him that is among you without Sin cast the first Stone at her</hi>,” and this is the moment
Richardson recommends to the painter, on the grounds that Jesus is at that moment the principal actor, and in
a dignified posture. In addition, the choice of this moment gives an opportunity for a rich and varied display
of both expressive faces, since the accusers are “asham’d, Vex’d, Confounded,” while the accused shows
“Hope, and Joy,” and also of expressive posture as the accusers disperse, “some being in Profile, some
Fore-right, and some with their Backs turn’d. . . . ” It is evident from this analysis that Richardson
sees history painting as a kind of frozen drama, and the vocabulary of the theatre—“Action,”
“Actors,” “Vigorous Moments,” “Scene”—pervades the whole account. It is the conflict of
personalities, and the varied expressive gestures that arise from the conflict, that Richardson sees as the
source of energy and interest.</p>
          <p>Richardson’s essay was reprinted several times during the eighteenth century, was widely read,
and influenced such major figures as Hogarth, Lessing, Reynolds, and Benjamin West.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n10" type="note">10</ref> It can be taken as both summing up a tradition of history
painting as it had developed by 1715, and as outlining values and methods for the succeeding period. There is
no specific evidence that Blake read it, but given its availability and the nature of Blake’s interests it
is very likely that he did, though he obviously did not follow its prescriptions. Before turning to Blake’s
<hi rend="i">The Woman Taken in Adultery</hi>, however, I shall look at one more version of the episode, one
almost contemporary with Blake’s. <note id="n10"><hi rend="s">10</hi> See Richardson, “Note” by R.
Woodfield, n.p.</note></p>
          <p>This version was painted by W. Artaud for Macklin, and presumably displayed by him in his
Poets’ Gallery; it was published in his Bible in 1800 in the form of an engraving by P. Thomson dated 1794
(illus. 8).<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n11" type="note">11</ref> Blake shows a painful
awareness of Macklin’s projects: “I was alive &amp; in health &amp; with the same Talents I now have all
the time of Boydell’s, Macklin’s, Bowyer’s, &amp; other Great Works. I was known by them &amp; was
looked upon by them as Incapable of Employment in those Works” (letter to Hayley, 11 Dec. 1805, K 862).
Blake must have seen Artaud’s design, probably in both its painted and engraved forms, and one can think of
Blake’s Bible paintings for Butts as a kind of personal challenge to Macklin’s Bible, a project which he
had not been invited to join as either designer or engraver. <note id="n11"><hi rend="s">11</hi> On Macklin,
see T.S.R. Boase, “Macklin and Bowyer,” <hi rend="i">JWCI</hi>, 26 (1963), 148-77. For a brief general
overview, see C.M. Kauffmann, <hi rend="i">The Bible in British Art 10th to 20th Centuries</hi>, Exhibition
Catalogue (London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1977).</note></p>
          <p>It is almost possible to imagine Artaud as Blake’s spectre or <hi rend="i">alter ego</hi>, an
image of the moderately successful history and portrait painter that Blake might have become if he had gone to
Italy in the 1780s and had ruthlessly and totally suppressed the poet and creator that he was.<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n12" type="note">12</ref> But Artaud no doubt had his own substantial
and rather pedestrian existence. <note id="n12"><hi rend="s">12</hi> See <hi rend="i">DNB.</hi> Artaud was
active 1776-1822. He was primarily a portrait painter; he first exhibited in the Academy in 1780, as did
Blake. He sent portraits there in 1784 and 1786, won a gold medal for a picture from <hi rend="i">Paradise
Lost</hi>, and in 1795 won a travelling studentship. He did portraits of, among others, Bartolozzi and
Priestley. The parallels are almost as striking as the differences, and it is hard to believe that Blake never
came across him.</note></p>
          <p>Artaud’s design is obviously indebted to Poussin’s, and chooses the same moment—not quite
Richardson’s, but nevertheless a moment in which Jesus is clearly the principal actor. Artaud’s Jesus has
already written his challenge on the ground, and now stands gesturing towards the woman with an open right
hand while indicating his text with the left. Artaud, like Poussin, places a woman with a baby in the space
between Jesus and the adulteress, and again like Poussin he shows the accusers in a wide variety of positions,
as if to illustrate Richardson’s words, “some being in Profile, some Foreright, and some with their Backs
turn’d. . . . ”</p>
          <p>Despite the relationship, however, Artaud’s design leaves an impression very different from
that made by the earlier painter’s version. Poussin’s strong, angular, theatrical gestures have been
softened and rounded, and Artaud’s Jesus and woman in particular have a sentimentality that accords with
Boase’s comment on the illustrations in the Macklin Bible taken as a group: “The century of the novel and
of the rise of romantic as opposed to classical drama has not been without its effect, and the Biblical heroes
and heroines are touched by the new tradition of Pamela and Clarissa, of Garrick and Mrs. Siddons.”<supplied

at the mechanical level of perspective there are serious defects in the handling of the flagstones. The design
is now of interest only because it shows how a very mediocre painter exactly contemporary with Blake
visualized the episode in the light of the tradition of history painting as he received and interpreted it,
and throws into strong relief the fundamentally different aesthetic which shaped Blake’s design.

          <p>If we turn now to look at Blake’s watercolor against the background formed by the versions
discussed above and by Richardson’s analysis of the painterly possibilities of the subject, we are
immediately struck by the absence of most of the usual expressive elements. The bareness is most noticeable at
the level of setting and costume. The often rich and ornate architecture of the temple has been simplified to
the bare indication of a low, massive arch. The costumes are highly generalized; the accuser on the right has
a hood slung back over his garment, but apart from that detail the robes are very simple, though varied in
color. Jesus and the woman wear equally plain robes, both clear white to stand out against the colored robes
of the accusers.</p>
          <p>There is a corresponding simplification of the dramatic elements of the scene: no onlookers, no
sulking respondents or angry husbands, not even the usual soldiers standing as embodiments of the physical
power of the law. Jesus and the woman have remarkably impassive faces, and surprisingly similar
features—large eyes seen in profile, strongly curved eyebrows, long straight noses. No other post-medieval
version known to me approaches the visual simplicity of Blake’s.</p>
          <p>There are only two groups of figures in the design, the defeated accusers, and Jesus with the
woman. The accusers are visible only from the back, and apart from the color of the robes little attempt has
been made to differentiate them; indeed, the similarly uplifted heels of both the central and right hand
figures suggest the repetition of a single movement. The possibilities for dramatic and expressive variety
have not been exploited. Bindman calls this “undifferentiated mass of humanity . . . one of Blake’s most
original ideas,”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n14" type="note">14</ref> and the
originality lies precisely in the refusal to apply the art of invention as it was usually understood.

          <p>One effect of these separate but identical retreating backs is to emphasize the sense of John’s
statement that

</figure>
the accusers left “convicted by their own conscience.” They turn away from us into their own world. John
emphasizes their inward-turned isolation by saying that they “went out one by one”; Blake’s figures are
isolated by their virtual identity with each other, which short-circuits the animated conversation and
interaction typical of previous versions of the scene.</p>
          <p>The unanimous flight of the accusers also emphasizes the power of the words that Jesus has just
uttered; their effect has obviously been irresistible and universal. These words were, we must assume, “He
that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.” In most previous versions these words
start a debate; here they produce an immediate conviction of sin. The accusers have become the self-condemned
in a <hi rend="i">peripeteia</hi> more sharply focused than in any other version, though Giulio Romano’s
approaches it. Blake has designed his painting to pay tribute to the power of Jesus’s words to return people
to their true selves, rather than to display his own power to differentiate shades of response.</p>
          <p>The woman’s hair is disheveled and her breast bare to remind us that she “was taken in
adultery, in the very act.” Many previous versions show her making some gesture towards modestly covering
her bosom, and many show her with head lowered or averted in shame and repentance. In Blake’s version, she
stands with upright dignity, and makes no gesture towards covering her bared breast. Despite her
half-nakedness and disheveled hair, she stands with grace and strength. Her strongly physical presence implies
a sexuality not yet obliterated by shame and remorse.</p>
          <p>Blake shows her with wrists bound behind her back, and he is the only painter I know of to do
this. This detail increases her apparent helplessness, and makes her release more obviously dependent upon the
act of another. But it also almost forces her to stand upright, and prevents her from covering her body. The
woman is thus in a state which combines bondage and helplessness with freedom and defiance. She is in a
no-man’s land between life and death; her would-be accusers have fled, and with them the threat of immediate
death, but she is still bound. She looks at Jesus’s hand with steady concentration,
<pb id="p17-50" n="50"/>
waiting for the words that will release her into life.</p>
          <p>Blake has shown Jesus in the act of beginning to write with his finger on the ground. This is a
common enough moment to choose for illustration, as the historical survey above has shown, but again there are
unusual elements in Blake’s handling of the figure. Bruegel and various eighteenth-century painters had
shown Jesus lowering himself onto one knee in order to write. But no painter known to me had, since the ninth
century, shown Jesus simply bending from the waist to write. As a moment’s trial will show, Blake’s Jesus
is doing something rather difficult, despite the apparent ease of the gesture. He has, like the woman, an
almost athletic physical presence; the painting comes near to implying that such bodily strength and grace are
alone sufficient to deflect accusation.</p>
          <p>Jesus’s face, again like the woman’s, shows a calm concentration upon the act he is about to
perform. Emotion, even pity, would be misplaced: it is imaginative understanding that is needed. Once again
Blake bypasses

an opportunity for a display of invention as traditionally understood in favor of total concentration upon the
essential situation.</p>
          <p>Having looked at the individual figures, we should now consider the moment and situation defined
by Blake’s design. That design is unique in ways that become apparent when it is placed against the
background of previous versions, and those are in turn set in the context of theological commentary on the
episode. I shall focus on the act of writing on the ground, which forms the central action of Blake’s
design.</p>
          <p>Theological commentary offered a wide variety of interpretations of this act. Ambrose and
Augustine suggested that the act of writing on the ground was an allusion to Jeremiah 17:13, “O Lord, the
hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the
earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters.” In this interpretation, to write
on the earth is to write words that will be quickly washed away. Jerome suggested that Jesus
<pb id="p17-51" n="51"/>
wrote down the sins of the accusers, and this became a fairly popular interpretation.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n15" type="note">15</ref>

II (NY: Seabury Press, 1980), p. 165. There was serious doubt about the status and position of the episode,
but the Council of Trent affirmed its canonicity in 1546 by making no special declaration about it; see E.C.
Hoskyns, ed. F.N. Davey, <hi rend="i">The Fourth Gospel</hi> (London: Faber, 1940) II, 673-85.</note></p>
          <p>Another tradition of commentary on the passage held that Jesus did not in fact write words at
all, that the act of putting his finger to the dust expressed simply a postponement of decision, or a refusal
to be caught in a dilemma. Various versions of this appear in the Protestant reformers; Luther’s commentary
implies that the act of appearing to write in fact represented a refusal of communication,<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n16" type="note">16</ref> while Calvin is explicit that Jesus wrote
nothing at all: “By this gesture casting down his eyes He showed that He despised them. Those who suppose

          <p>Most of these interpretations pose obvious difficulties for a painter. The Jeremiah text needs to
be written in full and interpreted for its relevance to become apparent. Jerome’s suggestion would demand a
fairly long and legible text to be intelligible to a viewer. The attempt to illustrate the interpretations of
Luther and Calvin would raise the problem that we shall soon face in pushing towards a

</figure>
fuller interpretation of Blake’s design: is Jesus, with his finger in the dust, about to write something or
not, and if so, what?</p>
          <p>In order to avoid these problems, and to create an immediately intelligible image, most painters
who focused their design on this moment in the narrative made it clear, in one way or another, that Jesus did
write words, and that the words were simply a written repetition of the spoken “He that is without sin among
you, let him first cast a stone at her.” Artists such as the illustrator of the Codex Aureus, and Bruegel,
accomplished this by making the words clearly legible. Richardson, in discussing invention, recognized 
<hi rend="i">“plain Writing”</hi> as <hi rend="i">“one way of Expression more”</hi> in the painter’s
collection of tricks.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n18" type="note">18</ref>

          <p>Other painters, such as Poussin and Artaud, identified
<pb id="p17-52" n="52"/>
the words Jesus had written by means of an orchestration of the gestures of Jesus and the responses of the
accusers. This translation of illegible or inaudible words into visible and intelligible gestures is another
painter’s device listed and illustrated by Richardson under the general heading “kinds of 
<hi rend="i">Artificial Expressions indulg’d to Painters, and practis’d by them, because of the Disadvantage
of their Art in that particular, in Comparison of Words.</hi>”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref

          <p>Painters thus had two recognized ways of indicating the text that Jesus wrote on the ground.
Those painters who chose to focus their rendering of the woman taken in adultery on the moment when Jesus
speaks to the woman had no real choice but to translate the words into gesture, and the usual path was to show
Jesus making the sign of absolution. This is not in fact what John writes; in his account Jesus simply
refrains from condemnation. But painters can only articulate theology as far as they can render it
visible.</p>
          <p>The most striking fact about Blake’s painting, when looked at in this perspective, is that it
implies two texts rather than the one that is usual. He shows the accusers fleeing in a way that makes it
clear that they have already heard the challenge “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a
stone at her”; the words are clearly visible in their effects. But Jesus is shown about to write a text on
the ground, with the women as the only possible witness. He is therefore presumably not merely about to repeat
in written form the words he has just spoken, words which would be quite inappropriate if imagined as
addressed to the woman.</p>
          <p>Since Blake has shown Jesus at just the moment before the first letter becomes visible, it is
just possible to imagine Luther’s or Calvin’s nontexts, but again those were forms of rhetoric addressed
to the accusers, and we assume from Jesus’s gesture that he is in fact about to write something. It could
conceivably be a written rehearsal of the words spoken to the woman in John’s account, but that seems
awkward and unlikely, particularly in view of John’s statement that Jesus initiated the exchange after he
“had lifted up himself.” We must imagine a new, nonbiblical text, the general sense of which is clear, but
the exact form of which is left deliberately open. The vortex of potential verbal meaning which opens from
Jesus’s finger must be realized and fleshed out in our own imaginations. Blake’s view of the Bible was
that it consisted of “poetry inspired,” and that “Milton’s Paradise Lost is as true as Genesis, or
Exodus” (E 607). It follows that we can, if up to the job, imagine words for Jesus to write to the woman
that are as “true” as the words John describes Jesus as having spoken.</p>
          <p>We can also turn to Blake’s other treatments of the episode. The first is the brief comment in
<hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> that Jesus turned away “the law from the woman taken in
adultery” (E 42). <hi rend="i">The Everlasting Gospel</hi> gives a later and fuller version, which totally
rethinks and rewords the story. Blake there accepts the traditional identification of the woman as Mary
Magdalen, of which there is no evidence in the painting. He also uses both of Jesus’s texts, in modified
versions: the “breath of God” says, among other things, “Nor may the sinner cast one stone” and, a
little later, asks “Has no Man Condemned thee / . . . then what is he / Who shall Accuse thee” (E 513). It
is notable in this version of the story that Jesus speaks rather than writes; as Blake well knew, Jesus was a
speaker of “parables to the Blind” (E 516) rather than a writer of texts.</p>
          <p>In fact, this is the only episode in the gospels in which Jesus is described as writing; in
general, his was an oral message, and this is reflected in <hi rend="i">The Everlasting Gospel</hi>, where
Jesus puts aside the Law of Moses, visible in “The Ancient Heavens . . . / Writ with Curses from Pole to
Pole” (E 512) and then commands “Sinais trumpets cease to roar / Cease finger of God to write” (E
513).</p>
          <p>The opposition Blake posits between Jesus and Moses in this episode exists implicity in the
gospel narrative, as many theologians recognized. It points directly to the relevance of Blake’s painting of
<hi rend="i">God Writing Upon the Tables of the Covenant</hi> (illus. 9), which was executed at about the same
time as <hi rend="i">The Woman Taken in Adultery</hi>, and whose relationship to the latter has been noted by
several commentators.</p>
          <p>In the <hi rend="i">Covenant</hi> design, God is shown standing in huge power, with white hair,
over the tiny, crouching figure of Moses. He is in the act of writing the decalogue, the foundation of the
Mosaic code referred to by the accusers in John’s story. This moment is also traditionally the origin of the
associated arts of writing and engraving, as Blake knew. The letter that God has already written appears to be
a “Yod,”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n20" type="note">20</ref> the first letter of his
name, Jehovah. The formalization of a code binding on others is always seen by Blake as an act of the
Selfhood, here of “Jehovah Elohim The I Am of the Oaks of Albion” (E 549). 
<note id="n20"><hi rend="s">20</hi> See S. Foster Damon, <hi rend="i">A Blake Dictionary</hi>, With a New Index by M. Eaves
(Boulder: Shambhala, 1979), under “Moses,” “Angel of the Divine Presence,” and “Yod.”</note></p>
          <p>The Jesus of <hi rend="i">The Woman Taken in Adultery</hi>, by contrast, has the red hair of
imaginative energy, as so often in these Bible illustrations, and bows his body in a gesture which, despite
its graceful strength, would have been interpreted by Richardson as ignoble, as a sacrifice of postural
decorum. That may indeed be part of the meaning of the gesture for Blake—a sacrifice of selfhood that is
perhaps a low-key version of the final sacrifice anticipated by Mary’s questions in <hi rend="i">The
Everlasting Gospel</hi>: “And canst thou die that I may live / And canst thou Pity &amp; forgive” (E 514).
Morton Paley seems to imply this in summing up the contrast: “The Old Testament God has his back to us;
Jesus bows in a graceful arc before the accused adulteress.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref

          <pb id="p17-54" n="54"/>
          <p>The meaning of Jesus’s gesture is thus complex. There is first of all the implicit meaning of
the gesture itself as a sacrifice of selfhood, a not standing upon decorum in the presence of a transgressor.
And there is the potential meaning of the invisible words that are about to be written, which we have in some
manner to realize in and for ourselves. The two forms of meaning are profoundly interconnected: because Jesus
does not need to stand upon his postural dignity, does not need to maintain a visible Selfhood, he is able to
write words that will release the woman from the accusation of sin, whatever precisely those words will
be.</p>
          <p>By choosing just that moment when Jesus is about to write, but has not yet written one letter,
Blake makes it possible to give the gesture yet further significance. The voice that Mary hears in 
<hi rend="i">The Everlasting Gospel</hi> commands “Cease finger of God to write” (E 513), and perhaps one can
understand Jesus as not writing, even as erasing a previous text. The act can then be interpreted as

</figure>
the giving out of a new and uncodified covenant to cancel the written codes that define transgression. It is
the written word that holds the woman in bondage rather than the cord on her wrists, and her release depends
upon words that do not define or limit. The words that Jesus speaks to the woman in John are nearly all
questions or negatives—it is the fact that no man condemns her, including Jesus, that frees her—and the
total absence of written words in the design seems the visible symbol of an act which is in essence a
refraining from action. The paradox of words that occupy the center of the design, but are as yet unwritten,
is a key part of its total meaning.</p>

          <p>Several points that I wish to emphasize in concluding this analysis of <hi rend="i">The Woman
Taken in Adultery</hi> will go some of the way towards defining his “Style of Designing” as it operates
within this picture, and by implication others also.</p>
          <p>In the basic invention of the design, the strategy adopted to make a story visible, the most
striking feature is Blake’s decision to show both halves of the episode, and to allow them to coexist
relatively independently. Of the
<pb id="p17-55" n="55"/>
other versions I have discussed, Romano’s comes closest to Blake’s in showing both the fleeing accusers
and Jesus together with the woman, and it is worth exploring the differences that lie behind the
resemblance.</p>
          <p>In Romano’s design, the two columns of the temple are used to define the separate spaces of the
two actions, flight and absolution, which take place simultaneously in the present tense. The spoken words of
Jesus that motivated the flight are clearly in the past, but the flight itself is fully present to us in this
moment, with a variety of gesture and expression that fills much of the design with its activity. Similarly,
the gesture of absolution that Jesus extends to the modestly repentant woman is present and completely
intelligible in itself. The artist has changed aspects of John’s account, converting “one by one” into a
noisy rush and substituting a visible gesture for Jesus’s words to the woman; the changes have the effect of
minimizing the degree to which the intelligibility of the visible action depends upon a viewer’s recall of
the originating text.</p>
          <p>In Blake’s design, the flight of the accusers is not so much an immediately intelligible
activity (not a single face or hand is visible) as a testimony to the overwhelming power of the words Jesus is
understood to have spoken in the moment preceding the one we see. Analogously, the pointing finger of Jesus is
a gesture whose meaning is only partly visible in this moment; its meaning can only find fulfillment in the
words we must imagine are about to be written, which will define the relationship between Jesus and the woman.
Blake has not aimed so much at creating images that are immediately present and intelligible as at creating
vivid signs that point to the power of words that lie outside the temporal and spatial framework of the
design.</p>
          <p>These invisible words are the real motivating powers of the whole design. In fact the syntax of
the design, the interconnections that bind the separate figures together, are verbal rather than visual; the
figures do not look at each other, but exist in their own separate spaces, with the partial exception of the
woman, who watches Jesus’s finger for the words that are about to flow.</p>
          <p>There are two points at issue here. One is the question, much discussed in the eighteenth
century, of which exact moment in an episode history painters should choose to illustrate. The consensus was
that they should take that moment that best reflects both the past and the future in a pregnant
present.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n22" type="note">22</ref> That is a possible
interpretation of what both Romano and Blake have done, but both painters seem to have shaped their designs to
encompass the whole incident rather than to provide only a snapshot of one critical moment. The French Academy
defended the right of a history painter to take the freedom enjoyed by a dramatist “de joindre ensemble
plusieurs évenemens arrivez en divers temps pour en faire une seule action,”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n23" type="note">23</ref> and Blake seems to have done just this, though it is very
unlikely that he knew of this particular discussion. But certainly he understood history painting as something
more than the photograph of a moment in a theater. <note id="n22"><hi rend="s">22</hi> See N. Bryson,

a design. On this point Fuseli has some comments which are relevant enough to quote here. In Lecture IV Fuseli
attacks those “Subjects which cannot in their whole compass be brought before the eye, which appeal for the
best part of their meaning to the erudition of the spectator and the refinements of sentimental enthusiasm. 
. . . ”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n24" type="note">24</ref> He discusses several
paintings, including Raphael’s cartoon of the <hi rend="i">Donation of the Keys to St. Peter</hi>, which he
criticizes for being dependent upon a verbally based allegory, and Poussin’s <hi rend="i">Exposition of
Infant Moses on the Nile.</hi> Fuseli complains of the latter that “not one circumstance is omitted that
could contribute to explain the meaning of the whole; but the repulsive subject completely baffled the
painter’s endeavour to show the <hi rend="i">real</hi> motive of the action. We cannot penetrate the 
<hi rend="i">cause</hi> that forces these people to expose the child on the river, and hence our sympathy and
participation languish. . . .”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n25" type="note">25</ref>

          <p>This criticism, whether valid or not, is one that would apply to many of Blake’s paintings, and
ironically a similar complaint was made about one of Fuseli’s own paintings when an anonymous critic writing
about his <hi rend="i">Count Ugolino</hi> claimed to be unable to find the original story in Fuseli’s
picture: “Ugolino has the appearance of a man who, having in a fit of phrenzy destroyed the young female who
lies across his knees, has just returned to a sense of reason and remorse at the act which he has perpetrated.
. . . By this material error, that of the professed story, as it were, being not only imperfectly narrated,
but absolutely untold, the artist has entirely lost the passion he must have intended to enforce. . .
.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n26" type="note">26</ref> Blake came to Fuseli’s
defense, arguing among other things that “the critic must be a fool who has not read Dante, and who does not
know a boy from a girl” (E 705). <note id="n26"><hi rend="s">26</hi><hi rend="i"> Bell’s Weekly

          <p>This comment implies that for Blake the text illustrated was an integral part of a design, an
essential portion of the total context of information within which the design functioned. There is indeed some
evidence that Blake wrote out the relevant texts for his Bible illustrations, though there is not a consensus
of opinion on the point.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n27" type="note">27</ref> But whether
or not Blake himself actually wrote out the texts, their presence was assumed.

          <p>So far I have been considering the basic issues of invention, the overall disposition of the
story. If we turn to aspects of Blake’s practice in designing that have more to do with style, other issues
come to the fore. The most significant can be summed up by the word simplification. In omitting all that might
have appeared merely picturesque or distractingly expressive, Blake seems to be following a conscious decision
which he referred to in a letter to Butts of 22 November 1802; after citing Reynolds on
<pb id="p17-56" n="56"/>
the inferiority of the picturesque, Blake writes “I have now proved that the parts of the art which I
neglected to display in those little pictures &amp; drawings which I had the pleasure &amp; profit to do for
you, are incompatible with the designs” (K 814). The areas in which Blake has “neglected to display”
obvious artistry include color, facial expressiveness, and perspective, under which term we can include
architectural detail. These latter areas deserve some discussion.</p>
          <p>It is a striking feature of Blake’s <hi rend="i">The Woman Taken in Adultery</hi> that no face
visible in it shows any explicit emotion, and no face is turned towards us. One can contrast this with
Bryson’s characterization of Le Brun: “In his arrangement of battle scenes there is hardly a head which
does not turn in some way towards the viewer, to display fully its readable surface. . . . ”<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n28" type="note">28</ref> Blake claimed that the painter could
represent accurately expressive figures, and argued this both on his own behalf (“the Hands &amp; Feet . . .
the Lineaments of the Countenances they are all descriptive of Character” [<hi rend="i">VLJ</hi>, E 550]),
and in defense of Raphael against the doubts of Reynolds: “If Reynolds could not see. variety of Character
in Rafael Others Can” (annotations to Reynolds, E 642).<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n29"
type="note">29</ref> But in practice the expressions in Blake’s designs are by no means always clearly
readable, and the two passages just cited may contain a clue. In both Blake uses the word “Character,”
though Reynolds is talking about the impossibility of “the expression of a mixed passion.” Blake seems not
be have drawn a strong distinction between physiognomy and pathognomy: the passions exhibited reveal the true
character, and thus exist in an uneasy space between the reflection of a permanent state and the response to
the ever-changing moment caught in the design. This ambiguity of function reduces their power to help us in
the act of interpretation. <note id="n28"><hi rend="s">28</hi> N. Bryson, <hi rend="i">Word and Image</hi>, p.
37.</note>
	<note id="n29"><hi rend="s">29</hi> Reynolds almost certainly had in mind, among other possible works,
Benjamin Ralph, <hi rend="i">The School of Raphael; or, the student’s guide to expression in historical
painting</hi> (London, 1759).</note></p>
          <p>Expressiveness is not of course limited to the face; as Mitchell notes, “the expressiveness of
the human figure tends, for Blake, to be diffused throughout the body, rather than focused primarily in the
face.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n30" type="note">30</ref> There is much truth in that
statement, and I have said something above about what is communicated by the stances of Jesus and the woman.
But both figures are totally focused on the text which is about to appear, and their expressiveness depends
partly upon our ability to provide that text. <note id="n30"><hi rend="s">30</hi> W.J.T. Mitchell, 
<hi rend="i">Blake’s Composite Art</hi> (Princeton: Princeton Univ, Press, 1978), p. 26.</note></p>
          <p>If we turn to Blake’s overall handling of space in this design we find a comparable lack of
specific visual information. There is very little sense of real depth; the architectural setting, simplified
to an undecorated column and connecting arches, runs parallel to the picture frame, so that it contributes
little to the articulation of the space of the action. The area above the heads of the accusers has been left
virtually blank, and even the floor of the temple, which is used in so many paintings to provide information
on depth and directionality, is here left completely empty, waiting to be articulated into the semantic space
of language rather than into architectural and dimensional meaning.</p>
          <p>Bryson describes perspective as “The great guarantee of irrelevance,” as the “instituting
into the image [of] a permanent threshold of semantic neutrality”; the exact knowledge of how figures are
located in space “is precisely irrelevance and excess, the guarantee of the realism and the authentication
of the real.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n31" type="note">31</ref> Blake’s painting
contains astonishingly little excess information of that sort. Even the clues that come from the lighting do
not help us to reconstruct a quasidimensional space in which the action is represented as taking place: the
shadow under the foot of the central accuser suggests a light coming from above and to the right, but the
shadow cast by the woman implies a light coming from the left, while the hand of Jesus casts no shadow at all.
<note id="n31"><hi rend="s">31</hi> Bryson, <hi rend="i">Word and Image</hi>, p. 12.</note></p>
          <p>These clues seem to point to the haloed head of Jesus as the primary source of light in the
design, and it is appropriate that it is a human figure which, through the power of light, largely determines
the visual space in which the action takes place, just as it is a human act of signifying which gives meaning
to the action. It is the emanations of humanity that define space here rather than architectural
perspective.</p>
          <p>Again a reference to Fuseli will sharpen our sense of just what Blake is doing. Fuseli writes
that “All minute detail tends to destroy terrour, as all minute ornament, grandeur.”<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n32" type="note">32</ref> Later, Fuseli suggests that “Whatever
connects the individual with the elements . . . , is an instrument of sublimity,” and that the spatial
analogy of this is to give “the principal figure the command of the horizon”: in the case of Macbeth,
“place him on a ridge, his down-dashed eye absorbed by the murky abyss; surround the horrid vision with
darkness, exclude its limits, and shear its light to glimpses.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n33" type="note">33</ref> The notion of sublimity here is obviously related to Burkean categories, and
sees the manipulation of elemental forces and perspective as ways of browbeating the viewer into an almost
physical submission: painting as a form of bullying. <note id="n32"><hi rend="s">32</hi> Fuseli, 
<hi rend="i">Lectures</hi>, p. 109.</note>
	<note id="n33"><hi rend="s">33</hi><hi rend="i"> Life and Writings of Henry Fuseli</hi>, II,
225-26.</note></p>
          <p>Blake’s notion of the sublime is very different: “The Beauty proper for sublime art, is
lineaments, or forms and features that are capable of being the receptacles of intellect” 
(<hi rend="i">Descriptive Catalogue</hi>, E 535). In a lighter tone, Blake wrote a little verse:
<q>
Nature &amp; Art in this together Suit<lb/>
What is Most Grand is always most Minute<lb/>
Rubens thinks Tables Chairs &amp; Stools are Grand<lb/>
But Rafael thinks a Head a foot a hand (E 505)
</q>
The focus of these statements is very clear: it is the human power to signify that is the basis for the
sublime, not the sensory properties of the material world. The function of art is not to overpower the senses
but to stimulate the imaginative intellect, and that for Blake is the true “Sublime of the Bible” (E
94).</p>
          <p>This idea of the sublime as constituted by the power of human expressiveness is related to one of

of Blake’s quarrel with Reynolds, that of particularity. This quarrel begins in Discourse I, when Reynolds
writes that Raphael, after seeing the Sistine Chapel, went from “a dry, Gothick, and even insipid manner,
which attends to the minute accidental discriminations of particular and individual objects . . . [to] that
grand style of painting, which improves partial representation by the general and invariable ideas of
nature.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n34" type="note">34</ref> Blake responded to this
in the margin with “Minute Discrimination is not Accidental All Sublimity is founded on Minute
Discrimination” (E 632). Reynolds is talking about Raphael’s style in representing all three-dimensional
objects, as is clear from a latter passage;<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n35"
type="note">35</ref> Blake is really talking about the discrimination of character, as several of the
citations above make clear. The two are not talking about the same thing.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n36" type="note">36</ref>

	<note id="n36"><hi rend="s">36</hi> H. Adams discusses some of the ways in which Blake is unfair to Reynolds,

(Bloomington and London: Indiana Univ. Press, 1978), pp. 128-44. He does not deal at length with Discourse IV,
or with the particular point at issue here.</note></p>
          <p>We can perhaps discern an underlying uneasiness in Blake’s handling of the role of “minute
accidental discriminations” in art. When he is defending Raphael against Reynolds, he says that “The Man
who can say that Rafael knew not the smaller beauties of the Art ought to be Contemned” (E 642-43), implying
that even these smaller beauties have their function. When he defends himself before Butts, he accepts
Reynold’s argument that “Variety of Tints &amp; Forms” is an inferior excellence incompatible with
“the Grand Style,” and claims that he deliberately “neglected to display” these “parts of the art”
(E 690). The decision may have been a conscious one, but Blake sounds less than completely convinced. Bindman,
in spite of singling out <hi rend="i">The Woman Taken in Adultery</hi> for praise, says that pictorially the
group of designs dealing with the the life of Christ is the least interesting part of Blake’s Bible
illustrations,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n37" type="note">37</ref> and Blake may have
had a sense that he could have done better by Butts. <note id="n37"><hi rend="s">37</hi> Bindman, 
<hi rend="i">Blake as an Artist</hi>, p. 143.</note></p>
          <p>The fact is that there is a problematic thinness of visual information in <hi rend="i">The Woman
Taken in Adultery</hi>, and this is true both of the setting, costumes, and other “smaller beauties,” and
of the figures themselves, who borrow some of their expressiveness from our understanding of the drama they
enact. Bindman has speculated that the watercolor illustrations of the Bible made for Butts by Blake were
“intended not to be hung on a wall but to be either bound in a volume or interleaved in a large Bible,”
and Essick has made a similar suggestion.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n38"
type="note">38</ref> This seems very probable; these designs work best when seen as imaginative commentaries
upon a text, and it may well be that Blake thought of them as a personal response to Macklin’s Bible, as
illustrations to be bound together with a folio copy. <note id="n38"><hi rend="s">38</hi> Bindman, 
<hi rend="i">Blake as an Artist</hi>, p. 144, and R.N. Essick, rev. of Butlin, <hi rend="i">The Paintings and
Drawings of William Blake</hi>, p. 43.</note></p>
          <p>Such a strong connection with a text can give a sense of intellectual depth and resonance to a
design. But it can also lead to a feeling that the design has not fully cut the umbilical cord which still
holds it attached to language. This problem seems inherent in the notion of the sublime as created by human
hands and faces seen specifically as the agents of the activity of signifying, and Blake seems increasingly to
have felt the need to accompany his designs with written commentary, as in the entries in <hi rend="i">A
Descriptive Catalogue</hi> and the account of <hi rend="i">A Vision of The Last Judgment.</hi> This seems a
tacit recognition that such visual images are not quite self-sufficient, that they point in a variety of ways
to an underlying text which provides the semantic relationships that shape the meaning of the visual images.
Blake was most certainly “both Poet &amp; Painter,” but the “&amp;” must be understood as implying
that the Painter cannot be separated from the Poet any more than the Poet can be from the Painter.</p>
