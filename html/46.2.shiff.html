<p class="title">Blake’s Hebrew Calligraphy</p>
<p class="byline">By Abraham Samuel Shiff</p>

studies in the Master of Arts in Liberal Studies Program, the Graduate Center,
City University of New York. Another paper, <em>Blake’s Priestly Blessing: God
Blesses Job</em>, is forthcoming in <em>Blake</em>. He has also published on
Shakespeare.</p>
</div>
<div id="text">
<p>The exhibition at the Morgan Library and Museum of William Blake’s World:
“A New Heaven Is Begun” (Sept. 2009–Jan. 2010) <span class="notecall">provided
an opportunity to examine closely Blake’s Hebrew calligraphy.</span><span class="sidenote">I
am indebted to Anna Lou Ashby, Andrew W. Mellon Curator of the Morgan Library
and Museum, for her encouragement and advice, and for being my authority for
facts and information pertaining to Blake.</span> <span class="notecall">Three
works in the exhibition (see illus. <a href="#2.1">2.1</a>, <a href="#3.1">3.1</a>,
and <a href="#3.6">3.6</a>)</span><span class="sidenote">This paper examines the
three works for Blake’s use of Hebrew characters as calligraphy. Additional
works (from the Morgan and elsewhere) are described when helpful for the analysis.<br>
The paper is not a survey of all of Blake’s use of Hebrew. For the 
literature examining his use of Hebrew (mystical or otherwise), see 
Spector,
“Blake as an Eighteenth-Century Hebraist” and “Blake’s Graphic Use of 
Hebrew,” Cheskin, Paice, and their bibliographies.</span> contain errors in forming Hebrew
characters; some are deliberate to create clever visual illusions.</p>
<p>For clarity, several conventions are adopted for this article:<br>
1. Images: Items from the Morgan are cited by accession number, and if exhibited
also by exhibition number. <span class="notecall">The exhibited images are viewable
on the museum’s web site &lt;﻿<a href="http://www.themorgan.org/collections/works/blake" target="_blank">http://www.themorgan.org/collections/works/blake</a>﻿&gt;.</span><span class="sidenote">Click
on “Begin exhibition.” The images are numbered from 1 through 92. They are in
color and may be manipulated for magnification.</span><br>
2. Hebrew alphabet: For the convenience of readers without any knowledge of Hebrew,
a numeric code is used (see <a href="#serif">table 1</a>).<br>
For example, English is read from left to right.<br>
The first four characters of the English alphabet are<br>
A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D.<br>
In contrast, Hebrew is read from right to left.<br>
The first four characters of the Hebrew alphabet are<br>
<span lang="he">&nbsp;א&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ב&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ג&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ד</span>‎.
The encoded Hebrew becomes<br>
04-03-02-01.<br>
Some letters of the Hebrew alphabet change shape when located at the end of a
word. The code “f” identifies a final character. For example, the four-letter
English word “amen” is the three-letter Hebrew word “<span lang="he">אמן</span>‎” that
encodes as<br>
<span lang="he">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;א&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ן</span>‎<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14f-13-01, where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14f indicates that the last letter
of the word is character<br>
“<span lang="he">נ</span>‎” (14) written in its final
form, which is<br>
“<span lang="he">ן</span>‎” (14f).</p>

<a name="1.1" id="1.1"></a>
<p>When Blake illustrated Edward Young’s <em>Night Thoughts</em> (1797), he included
an image of God holding a scroll with Hebrew characters (illus. 1.1). <a name="1.1" id="1.1"></a>

</div>
These apparent words align with the right margin, as they should. They do not
appear to form legible words, however, but to be scrambled for visual effect.
Most surprising is that the letters are in reverse—wrongly engraved. Even
though letters “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎ (01) are reversed,
they are drawn in classical Hebrew-style serif. In later drawings and engravings,
Blake adopts an “N” shape for letter “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎ (01).
Serif Hebrew letters are composed of segments drawn broad and narrow, as seen
in <a href="#serif">table 1</a>. <span class="notecall">Here Blake made the broad elements, which are usually solid, in outline, as if hollow. In doing so, he may be mimicking
a popular Hebrew lexicon that used “hollow” letters as a teaching guide (illus.
1.3).</span><span class="sidenote">John Parkhurst designed his Hebrew and English
lexicon to teach Hebrew, as the title explains: <em>… Adapted to the Use
of Learners, and of Those</em> [self-taught students] <em>Who Have Not the Benefit
of a Master</em>. Illus. 1.3 is from the 1762 edition; later editions were published
in 1778, 1792, and 1799, and all four are viewable in <a href="http://find.galegroup.com/ecco" target="_blank"><em>Eighteenth
Century Collections Online</em></a> (<em>ECCO</em>). Each edition has a section
on Hebrew grammar containing hollow letters. In a footnote, Parkhurst instructs
the student: “If the Reader will take the trouble to colour the <em>hollow</em> letters
with <em>red</em> ink, in this and the following examples, he will make the Examples
still more clear and distinct; and indeed this may be no unprofitable exercise
to a Beginner” (1762, <em>ECCO</em> image 17; 1778, 45; 1792, 22; 1799, 24).
For examples of hollow letters, examine the grammar section pages following the
instruction. The last three editions also contain a chart with a title implying
it is a writing guide (1778, <em>ECCO</em> image 38; 1792, 15; 1799, 17), but
which actually portrays fragmented and distorted letters, as if to be a guide to <em>reading</em> print made by battered type. Blake may have used
the fragments as models for some of his graffiti-like Hebrew characters, though
it is only speculation that he saw and emulated Parkhurst’s lexicon. Illus. 1.3
is an enlarged portion of a verb conjugation table (1762, <em>ECCO</em> image
19). Copies of Parkhurst may be seen in <a href="http://books.google.com/" target="_blank"><em>Google
Books</em></a>.</span>

Beyond any doubt, Blake uses the classical serif style, but this is not proof
that he had command of the Hebrew language. Of the competence perceivable in
the composition, H. M. Margoliouth notes, <span class="notecall">“[Blake] seems
to have been <em>provided</em> with some Hebrew, perhaps not very legible, of
which he made a muddle” (emphasis mine).</span><span class="sidenote"><a name="Margoliouth" id="Margoliouth"></a>“A
Hebraist tells me … there are two Hebrew words, meaning ‘hereafter pain’
and referring to ‘Awful Eternity! offended Queen!’, which are fairly correct. … Here
he [Blake] seems to have been provided with some Hebrew, perhaps not very legible,
of which he made a muddle” (Margoliouth 49).</span>
<p><span class="notecall">Hebrew words written without the diacritical symbols
that indicate vowels can be ambiguous and challenging to translate.</span><span class="sidenote">I
thank Ari Cohen for his insightful assistance with this translation.</span> Fortunately,
the context is known. On the left side of the block of text, between the first
and second lines, Blake penciled an “X” (visible in <a href="#1.4">illus.
1.4</a>) <span class="notecall">identifying the words that he chose to illustrate:</span><span class="sidenote">See
Young, <em>Night Thoughts</em> (Folio Society), commentary vol., xviii.</span>
</p><blockquote>TIME was! ETERNITY now reigns alone!<br>
Awful Eternity! offended Queen!</blockquote>
The offended queen is the crowned woman. She points upwards towards eternity
while holding a book with Hebrew words—<span class="notecall">a metaphor
for God</span><span class="sidenote">For Blake, God is eternal and awe inspiring. He associates Hebrew with God (see illus. <a href="#1.1">1.1</a>, <a href="#3.1">3.1</a>, <a href="#3.6">3.6</a>,
and <a href="#3.7">3.7</a>).</span>—and standing triumphantly on the face
and throat of two vanquished figures—<span class="notecall">a metaphor
for time.</span><span class="sidenote">Blake often depicts death in <em>Night
Thoughts</em> by two different figures. One has a shaven head, sometimes with
just a topknot, as drawn here. The other is an aged man with flowing hair and
beard. In this composition, he uses both to represent time that brings death
to all living beings. Blake uses well-known representations for death and time:
see Quarles, “Book 3. Emblemes,” 181, and “Hierogliph VI,” 23.</span> Mindful
of the context, we may now attempt a translation.
<p>At first glance, there are two words, one on each page of the open book. <span class="notecall">Actually,
this is a phrase of three words spread over the two pages.</span><span class="sidenote">Blake
uses the same composition in placing a Hebrew slogan in a Job drawing (see the
analysis of <a href="#3.1">illus. 3.1</a>, below).</span> We begin with the right
page, as Hebrew is read from right to left. Parse the letters into two words,
each of three letters. The rightmost word, “<span lang="he">ריב</span>”‎ <span style="white-space: nowrap">(__02-10-20__)</span>,
means “strife.” Next is “<span lang="he">אחר</span>”‎ <span style="white-space: nowrap">(__20-08-01__)</span>,
which translates to “after.”<br>
The left page contains one word. Finding a meaningful translation consistent
with the theme requires three manipulations to correct errors typical of a neophyte
Hebraist. As written, “<span lang="he">כאם</span>”‎ <span style="white-space: nowrap">(__13f-01-11__)</span> translates
to “as a mother.” Clearly, this is contextually inappropriate.<br>
(1) <span class="notecall">Replace the “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎ (01)
with “<span lang="he">ע</span>”‎ (16), as both have the
English sound of A.</span><span class="sidenote">The two consonants, “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎ (01)
and “<span lang="he">ע</span>”‎ (16), have the same pronunciation
in the Ashkenazi and Sephardi dialects. Neophytes to Hebrew often use one for
the other. (Interestingly, the dialect spoken by Jews from Yemen maintains a
tradition of different pronunciations for the two consonants.)</span><br>
(2) Replace the “<span lang="he">ם</span>”‎ (13f), which
has the English sound of M, with the near identically shaped “<span lang="he">ס</span>”‎ (15),
which has the English sound of S. The word becomes “<span lang="he">כעס</span>”‎ <span style="white-space: nowrap">(__15-16-11__)</span>, <span class="notecall">meaning
“anger.”</span><span class="sidenote">The Hebraist quoted by Margoliouth (see <a href="#Margoliouth">note</a> above)
stopped at this point.</span> This is still not contextually acceptable. Another
correction is possible.<br>
(3) <span class="notecall">Replace the “<span lang="he">ס</span>”‎ (15)
with the same-sounding “<span lang="he">ת</span>”‎ (22).</span><span class="sidenote">In
both the Sephardi and Ashkenazi dialects “<span lang="he">ס</span>”‎ (15)
has the S sound. Not so with “<span lang="he">ת</span>”‎ (22)
(see next note).</span> <span class="notecall">In the Ashkenazi dialect spoken
by Jews in Blake’s London who originated from Germanic and East European regions,
the “<span lang="he">ת</span>”‎ (22) is pronounced S
as in “sav” (and not T as in “tav,” as indicated in <a href="#serif">table 1</a>).</span><span class="sidenote">In
the Sephardi dialect, today prevalent in Israel, “<span lang="he">ת</span>”‎
 (22)
is pronounced as T, as in “tav,” with or without the diacritical mark 
dagesh, especially
when a word ends with this letter. (The dagesh symbol is a dot placed in
 the
center of a letter: Microsoft Word, symbol chart, Times New Roman font, 
Unicode hexadecimal representation 05BC.) In the Ashkenazi dialect 
spoken in Germanic lands and central
Europe—and today by those trained in this tradition, as was the 
author—the
rule for pronouncing the diacritical mark is observed, thus “<span lang="he">ת</span>”‎ as
S, as in “sav,” and “<span lang="he">תּ</span>”‎ as T, as in “tav.” For example,
the word “Sabbath” is written “<span lang="he">שבת</span>”‎ <span style="white-space: nowrap">(__22-02-21__)</span>,
pronounced by the Sephardi speaker as shah-baht and by the Ashkenazi as shah-bahs.<br>
<a href="#serif">Table 1</a> conforms to the Microsoft Office Word 
symbol chart’s convention for assigning English names to Hebrew 
characters. The Times New Roman font, Unicode hexadecimal representation
 05EA
is assigned to “<span lang="he">ת</span>”‎ and is labeled
“Hebrew letter tav.” FB4A is assigned to “<span lang="he">תּ</span>”‎ and
is labeled “Hebrew letter tav with dagesh.” It is obvious that whoever 
assigned the English labels for the “sav” and “tav” used the Sephardi 
dialect.<br>
For a linguist’s explanation, see Bar-Adon, chapter 6, “On Some Basic Differences
between the Ashkenazi and the Sephardi Traditions of Pronunciation,” 27-30.</span> To
conceptualize this third and necessary correction, the Ashkenazi pronunciation
is critical. Make this change, and the word becomes “<span lang="he">כעת</span>”‎ <span style="white-space: nowrap">(__22-16-11__)</span>,
meaning “as time.”<br>
<span class="notecall">Together, the Hebrew phrase may be translated:</span><span class="sidenote">The
impression given by the phrase is that it is a simplistic translation of the
English “Time, as after the strife,” literally replacing each English word with
a Hebrew equivalent, one by one, working from left to right as English is written
and read, instead of creating a Hebrew translation from the sense of the English.</span>
</p><div class="Hebrew"><span lang="he">ריב&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אחר&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כעת</span>‎<br>
As time, after strife</div>
The image portrays the offended queen pointing to eternity triumphant over vanquished <em>time,
after strife</em> has concluded.
<p>Blake had another opportunity to include Hebrew characters in <em>Night Thoughts</em> (illus.
1.5). That image illustrates an incident described in Daniel chapter 5, where
strange words appear on a wall to announce the impending doom of the startled
and alarmed King Belshazzar. The complete slogan is MENE, MENE, TEKEL UPHARSIN
(Daniel 5.25). In the engraving, however, Blake uses a few faintly drawn English
characters to represent the slogan, instead of Hebrew letters.

</div>
<p>One may infer that Blake was not in command of the Hebrew alphabet in 1797,
because in <em>Night Thoughts</em> he uses Hebrew-like graffiti mixed with actual
letters (although reversed) and Hebrew words with apparent errors. In 1803 he
writes to his brother, declaring that he was then first learning Hebrew—“am
now learning my Hebrew”—and demonstrating the first three letters of the
alphabet: “<span lang="he">אבג</span>”‎ <span style="white-space: nowrap">(__03-02-01__)</span> (illus.
1.6). <a name="1.6" id="1.6"></a>
</p><div class="illus"><img src="541.jpg" alt="Detail of letter of 30 January 1803" height="196" width="575">

images 5-8 (the Hebrew is in image 8).</div>
</div>
He also writes, “I go on Merrily with my Greek &amp; Latin … I read Greek as
fluently as an Oxford scholar &amp; the Testament is my chief master ….” It is
tempting to speculate that Blake in later works forms the Hebrew “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎ (01)
as the Greek letter “nu” (N) because he studied Greek and read the
Septuagint. The use of the N-shape must be deliberate, because we have here evidence
of his ability to form the “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎ (01)
in its classical shape from the letter of 1803 and in the earlier <em>Night Thoughts</em> engraving
and drawing.
<p>To support an argument advanced later, I here make note of the variety of
errors in publishing the Hebrew characters that Blake wrote to his brother (see <a href="#1.6">illus.
1.6</a>); <span class="notecall">some of these errors have been brought to the
attention of Blake scholars by Arnold Cheskin.</span><span class="sidenote">See

his rightmost letter. In Hebrew, the traditional full stop (period) may be a
single diamond subscript, or two diamonds one above the other (as in a colon).
Since Hebrew is read from right to left, the full stop would properly be placed
to the left of the leftmost letter. Did the typesetter intend the letter “<span style="color: #F00" lang="he">י</span>”‎ (<span style="color: #F00">10</span>)

<p>We next consider a drawing from the Passion cycle: <em>Christ Nailed to the
Cross: The Third Hour</em> (illus. 2.1). Behind the head of Christ is a person
with Hebrew on his costume in two places: over the forehead on the miter, and
on the hem of the robe draped over the left forearm. <a name="2.1" id="2.1"></a>

The right word is the tetragrammaton and the left translates as “I,” for the
two-word phrase <span class="notecall">“I am the Lord.”</span><span class="sidenote">I
am indebted to Ari Cohen for this suggestion.</span> Literally interpreted, this
would have the high priest proclaim himself to be God—<span class="notecall">certainly
not a Jewish theological concept, but blasphemy, as Blake would have known.</span><span class="sidenote">Did
Blake use this opportunity to slur the high priest? Spector explains: “Although
difficult for someone of the twentieth century to comprehend, the most significant
aspect of eighteenth-century Christian Hebraism was its anti-Semitism” (“Blake
as an Eighteenth-Century Hebraist” 180). See also Alexander Gilchrist, <em>Life
of William Blake, “Pictor Ignotus”</em> : “Though at one with
Paine, Godwin, Fuseli, and the others [of his circle], as to politics, he was
a rebel to their theological or anti-theological tenets. Himself a heretic among
the orthodox, here among the infidels he was a saint, and staunchly defended
Christianity—the spirit of it—against these strangely assorted disputants”
(1: 94). Gilchrist does not report details of the theological debates. Any discussion
about Christianity would necessarily draw upon its Judaic roots.</span> <span class="notecall">Alternatively,
perhaps Blake wrote “<span lang="he">ל</span>”‎ (12)
instead of “<span lang="he">י</span>”‎ (10) as the right
ambiguous letter</span><span class="sidenote">See the comment on <a href="#3.2a">illus.
3.2a</a> on the manner in which Blake forms the letter “<span lang="he">ל</span>”‎ (12).
Note that the line that Blake drew is as dense as the adjacent letter, and may
not be what appears at first glance as the edge of the plate.</span> in an attempt
to have the right word represent (as a contraction) “to the Lord.” <span class="notecall">Literally
translated, the phrase becomes the awkward “I am to the Lord.”</span><span class="sidenote">A
third suggestion is that the apparent “<span lang="he">ג</span>”‎ (03)
is actually a poorly executed “<span lang="he">ב</span>”‎ (02),
making the left word “<span lang="he">אבי</span>”‎ <span style="white-space: nowrap">(__10-02-01__)</span>,
which means “my father.” The slogan would then read “The Lord my
father.” However, Blake’s obvious error demonstrated in <a href="#3.2e">illus.
3.2e</a> makes this possibility unlikely. I am indebted to Carin and Ben Dachs
for this suggestion.</span>
<p>If we set aside consideration of any theological purpose that Blake had in
mind in writing this slogan, it appears to represent the same theme as in <em>Job’s
Evil Dreams</em> (<a href="#3.1">illus. 3.1</a>). There, Satan points to the
slogan “Your God gave from heaven,” which is Blake’s way of depicting
God’s authority and permission to test Job, with Satan as his agent. Blake may
here be assigning to the high priest the role of a satanic-like agent of God
in the crucifixion. Whatever the purpose, Blake uses the high priest’s vestments
as a slogan board, just as he makes use of the tablets of the Ten Commandments
in the Job drawing.
</p><p>I now consider the second slogan. The high priest wears a robe with a string
of characters on the hem draped over his left forearm (illus. 2.3). The monograph
in the <em>Encyclopaedia Judaica</em> (see <a href="#vestments">note</a> above)
describes and illustrates the priestly vestments, as specified in the Bible:
there is no robe, nor are there embroidered characters. For Blake, the hem appears
to be yet another convenient call-out or balloon space to place one more slogan,
although this slogan is not obvious. The words at the start and end are incomplete,
as if lost in the folds of the robe, and some characters are ambiguous. One word
is distinct, however: “<span lang="he">צור</span>”‎ <span style="white-space: nowrap">(__20-06-18__)</span>,
which translates to “rock.”
</p><div class="illus"><img src="445.jpg" height="241" width="500">
<div>2.3. <em>Christ Nailed to the Cross: The Third Hour</em>. The high priest’s
robe, with the hem enlarged and rotated.</div>
</div>
This suggests that Blake was depicting a common phrase, recognizable from just
the segment visible. If the phrase was from the Old Testament, a Hebrew Bible
concordance should identify it. <span class="notecall">A concordance search yielded
thirty-eight entries for the word “<span lang="he">צור</span>”‎ <span style="white-space: nowrap">(__20-06-18__)</span> and
fourteen for “<span lang="he">צורי</span>”‎ <span style="white-space: nowrap">(__10-20-06-18__)</span>, “my
rock.”</span><span class="sidenote">Wachsman 1602-03.</span> No match was found.<br>
The <em><a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/" target="_blank">William Blake Archive</a></em> suggests
that the slogan on the hem is an abstract representation of the phylactery worn
on the left arm during certain <span class="notecall">Jewish prayer services.</span><span class="sidenote">In
e-mail correspondence dated 7 March 2010, the <em>Blake Archive</em> graciously
provided an advance draft of an editorial note suggesting the phylactery theory: “The
Hebrew letters are written vertically, bottom to top, on the priest’s cloak
where it falls below his left arm, possibly as an unconventional substitute for
the phylactery conventionally worn on the left arm.”
The complete note is now published; see the <em><a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/" target="_blank">William
Blake Archive</a></em>, Drawings and Paintings, Water Color Drawings, Illustrations
to the Bible, object 33, editors’ note on line 02.</span> The wearing of
phylacteries is a biblical command (Deuteronomy 6.8) as a devotional reminder
during prayer of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. <span class="notecall">The
phylactery contains passages from the Bible: Deuteronomy 6.4-9 and 11.13-21,
and Exodus 13.1-16.</span><span class="sidenote">P. Birnbaum 5n-6n.</span> No
sentence there contains the word “<span lang="he">צור</span>”‎ <span style="white-space: nowrap">(__20-06-18__)</span>,
which Blake depicts so clearly and centrally. Perhaps he quotes from the New
Testament, or from some commentary, or one of his own works, translating the
words into Hebrew.
<p class="subtitle">3. Job Series</p>
<p>We next examine <em>Job’s Evil Dreams</em>, one of the twenty-one drawings
for the Thomas Butts Job series, which contains eight Hebrew words (illus. 3.1). <a name="3.1" id="3.1"></a>

</div>
In the upper center background, partly obscured by Satan’s cloven-hoofed leg
and the snake coiled around his torso, there is a representation of the Ten Commandments
on two conjoined tablets, with Hebrew in sans-serif characters. Blake wrote the
letters sans serif in his typical flowing manner. Serif offers certain visual
clues to identify one letter from another that are lost in sans serif, thus demanding
great caution in forming the letters. <span class="notecall">Even if we allow
for artistic liberties, he formed many incorrectly.</span><span class="sidenote">Spector
argues that “since Blake <em>probably</em> had a Hebrew text before him as he
worked [on <em>Job’s Evil Dreams</em>], had he wished, he could have reproduced
this source [the Ten Commandments] exactly. The picture’s irregularities,
then, are <em>probably</em> deliberate rather than accidental” (“Blake as an
Eighteenth-Century Hebraist” 201; emphasis mine). Having thus dismissed consideration
that Blake made errors, Spector hypothesizes his rationale for drawing as he
did.</span> Of course, he was in the early stages of his Hebrew studies at this
time, if indeed he continued to study much beyond the 1803 date of the letter
to his brother (<a href="#1.6">illus. 1.6</a>).
<p>The crucial contextual guide to recognizing the letters that Blake 
wrote is the words of the Ten Commandments as given in Exodus 20.2-14. 
Although the commandments
vary in wordiness in the biblical text, tradition represents each with 
two words.
Tradition also places five two-word representations on each of the two 
tablets

<div class="footnotes"><a href="#fra1" name="fna1" id="fna1">a</a>. God is known
by many names in the Bible. Those who strictly adhere to the third commandment,
“Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain,” use traditional euphemisms
in writing and speaking. “Lord thy God” is an example of an English-language
euphemism. The Greek tetragrammaton, literally the four letters, is another,
as is the numeric coding scheme used in this paper.<br>
When Hebrew is written or spoken, the traditional euphemism is to substitute
letters. For the tetragrammaton, the four-letter word “<span lang="he">יקוק</span>”‎,
which is not a name of God (and codes as <span style="white-space: nowrap">__19-06-19-10__</span>), is
written or pronounced. The euphemism adopted by this paper to avoid substituting
Hebrew letters in writing any of God’s names simply is not to write a word. Each
letter stands alone.<br>
<a href="#frb1" name="fnb1" id="fnb1">b</a>. Exodus 20.13 contains four commandments,
the sixth through the ninth. The sixth to eighth are sentences of two words,
while the ninth is a sentence of five words.</div>
</div>
<p>Illus. 3.2 shows Blake’s tablets enlarged. If we bear in mind that Hebrew
is written and read from right to left, the right tablet (to the viewer) should
contain five two-word representations of the first through fifth commandments.
Blake’s has only one word. The left tablet should begin with the sixth commandment.

eighth are the third and fourth lines, respectively.

<p>My analysis of the calligraphy begins with the left tablet, setting aside
the first line, which will be discussed last. Blake depicts on the second line
the two-word convention for the sixth commandment, “Thou shalt not kill” (illus.

Letter “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎ (01) shows two overlaid

was drawn first and then overlaid by the correct stroke (illus. 3.2a1-2). At
the instant of drawing the letter, Blake demonstrates ambivalence. The obvious
confusion with forming the first letter of the alphabet indicates that at the
time of creating the Job series he was not a practiced writer of Hebrew.

on left tablet, second line.</div>
</div>
Analysis of nearly every other letter reinforces this impression. Letter “<span lang="he">ת</span>”‎ (22)
is distorted. Properly formed, it contains four segments: a top horizontal stroke,
an attached vertical stroke descending on the right side, and a vertical stroke
descending on the left side with a small additional horizontal stroke at the
base turning away from the body of the letter (consider a leg with an attached
foot). In sans serif, the foot is the only visual indicator that it is not
the similar “<span lang="he">ח</span>”‎ (08). Blake drew
both vertical strokes with feet attached. Is this artistic embellishment at the
expense of legibility or confusion over how to form the letter?<br>
Letter “<span lang="he">צ</span>”‎ (18) is curious. At
first glance, it appears to be the expected <span lang="he">צ</span>‎-shape.
However, when the image is magnified, Blake’s ambiguity becomes obvious. It appears
to be a distorted “<span lang="he">ע</span>”‎ (16). <a name="3.2a3" id="3.2a3"></a>The
stick figures below (illus. 3.2a3) demonstrate how the letters differ in construction.<br>

to meet with the rightmost end of a horizontal base. A short diagonal from the
upper right touches the long diagonal near midpoint. Letter “<span lang="he">ע</span>”‎ (16)
does not have a horizontal base. The long diagonal descends from the upper right
and then angles acutely to the lower left. A shorter diagonal line begins upper
left and descends at an angle towards the right until it meets the long diagonal
coursing to the left. <span class="notecall">Compare the stick figures for letters “<span lang="he">צ</span>”‎ (18)

</p><p>The third line, of two words, is the seventh commandment: “Thou shalt not
commit adultery” (illus. 3.2b). Blake wrote:

<div>3.2b. <em>Job’s Evil Dreams</em>. Left tablet, third line.</div>
</div>
The letter “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎ (01) is twice
used. Careful comparison of the “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎s
demonstrates that the right instance is reversed, while the left is properly
formed. Blake often reverses this letter, which has three elements: an angled
stroke that runs from the upper left to the bottom right and two vertical strokes
of uneven sizes joined to each side of the angled stroke. Blake uses the “N”
shape drawn sans serif. The reversed letter is perfectly recognizable because
of the three elements, but the ambiguity in the proper presentation of the first
letter of the Hebrew alphabet in this line is glaringly obvious.<br>
Letter “<span lang="he">נ</span>”‎ (14) is distorted
almost to the point of confusion. When properly drawn, the top horizontal segment
is shorter than the bottom. With the two horizontal strokes identical, it may
be confused with sans-serif letters “<span lang="he">ב</span>”‎ (02)
and “<span lang="he">כ</span>”‎ (11); with the base angled
down towards the left, there is room for confusion with “<span lang="he">ג</span>”‎ (03).
From the context, “<span lang="he">נ</span>”‎ (14) is
the intended letter. Here, and in examples to follow, Blake shows a propensity
to slant what should be a horizontal baseline.
<p>The eighth commandment, “Thou shalt not steal,” is line four (illus. 3.2c).
There Blake wrote a fragment of a word with distorted letters, the end of the
second word of the commandment.

From context, the partial character “?” in illus. 3.2c must be “<span lang="he">ת</span>”‎ (22),
and the “<span lang="he">כ</span>”‎ (11) is a distorted “<span lang="he">ג</span>”‎ (03)
whose lower-right extension is truncated, apparently by artistic design because
of the overflowing edge of Satan’s garment. Nevertheless, the apparent “<span lang="he">ו</span>”‎ (06)
is a distorted “<span lang="he">נ</span>”‎ (14), and
the last letter, which appears to be “<span lang="he">נ</span>”‎ (14),
is actually a poorly executed “<span lang="he">ב</span>”‎ (02).<br>
The ninth and tenth commandments are not depicted.
<p>Before we consider the first line of the left tablet, it is necessary to analyze
the single word on the right tablet, which appears immediately beneath Satan’s
outstretched, pointing hand (illus. 3.2d). Blake wrote four letters:
</p><div class="illus"><img src="455.jpg" height="227" width="500">
<div>3.2d. <em>Job’s Evil Dreams</em>. Right tablet, line of text.</div>
</div>
The first letter (reading from right to left) is certainly “<span lang="he">ש</span>”‎ (21),
even though when examined under magnification it is hesitatingly drawn, and the
center vertical segment, which should angle downwards to the left, is angled
towards the right.<br>
At first glance, the second letter appears to be “<span lang="he">ם</span>”‎ (13f),
obviously an error because “<span lang="he">ם</span>”‎ is
a final letter. From context, it cannot be the very similar “<span lang="he">ס</span>”‎ (15).
Blake intended “<span lang="he">מ</span>”‎ (13).<br>
The last letter, “<span lang="he">ח</span>”‎ (08), shows
a hesitatingly drawn line at its base when magnified, as if Blake was indecisive
about the bottom, which, if closed, converts the apparent “<span lang="he">ח</span>”‎ (08)
to “<span lang="he">ם</span>”‎ (13f).<br>
The corrections yield
<div class="extract"><img src="516.jpg" height="34" width="132"></div>
<!--<div class="Hebrew"><span lang="he" style="letter-spacing: 15px">&nbsp;&#1513;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;</span><br />

which translates into the word “heaven.” There is no such word, however, in the
two-word abbreviations of any of the first five commandments. As will be made
clear below, Blake has written “heaven” for another purpose. <a name="3.2e" id="3.2e"></a>
<p>For the left tablet’s topmost line (illus. 3.2e), Blake wrote:

To correct his calligraphy, we replace the “<span lang="he">ח</span>”‎ (08)
with the similar “<span lang="he">ה</span>”‎ (05), <span class="notecall">the
poorly shaped “<span lang="he">ף</span>”‎ (17f)</span><span class="sidenote">What
I describe as a poorly shaped “<span lang="he">ף</span>”‎ (17f)
Spector perceives to be a “<span lang="he">ך</span>”‎ (11f)
with a vowel point (qamats) shaped like a “┬” under the top horizontal stroke
(Microsoft Word, Times New Roman font, Unicode hexadecimal representation 05B8). First,
and especially in sans serif, it is the small dangling appendage attached to
and hanging from the left edge of the top horizontal stroke that differentiates
the “<span lang="he">ף</span>”‎ (17f) from the “<span lang="he">ך</span>”‎ (11f),
and it is this appendage that Blake apparently misplaced and mangled. Second,
a vowel point must stand apart: no portion should touch any part of the letter.
The assumed vowel is attached to the letter, as the magnified drawing clearly
shows. Therefore, it is part of the letter and not a vowel point. Third, observe
the letter’s vertical stroke bifurcated at its bottom where it should be a single
line in both the “<span lang="he">ף</span>”‎ (17f) and “<span lang="he">ך</span>”‎ (11f).
This is just another poorly formed letter. Further, it is usual for multiple
letters in a word to be vowelled, when vowels are used at all (although, as Spector
points out, there are exceptions). See “Blake’s Graphic Use of Hebrew” 69.</span> with
the similar “<span lang="he">ך</span>”‎ (11f), the clearly
formed “<span lang="he">ג</span>”‎ (03) with the very
similar “<span lang="he">נ</span>”‎ (14), and the last
letter of the second word, “<span lang="he">ג</span>”‎ (03),
with “<span lang="he">נ</span>”‎ (14) in its final form, “<span lang="he">ן</span>”‎ (14f).<br>

With artistic license, Blake actually wrote a three-word slogan across the two
tablets. Beginning with the lone word on the right tablet, and continuing with
the two words at the top of the left tablet, the slogan translates into the almost
grammatically correct phrase “Your God gave [gives] from heaven.” <span class="notecall">Blake
precisely depicts the plain text of the Bible—Satan declares his authorization
to inflict tribulations on Job by pointing to the tablets of the Ten Commandments,
which represent God.</span><a name="challenge" id="challenge"></a><span class="sidenote">He
graphically portrays the literal story told in the first two chapters of Job
(the authorization is indicated in italics). Satan challenges God: “‘But
put forth <em>Thy hand</em> now, and touch all that he hath, surely he will blaspheme
Thee to Thy face.’ And the Lord said unto Satan: ‘<em>Behold, all that he hath
is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand</em>’” (Job 1.11-12
[Soncino edition]). In the plain text we read of Satan, as God’s “hand,” killing
every person belonging to Job, sparing only those who are more useful as tormentors
if kept alive, and destroying his wealth (flocks and herds of animals). Job withstands
the challenge. Satan returns to God for more authority: “And the Lord said unto
Satan: ‘… he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou didst move <em>Me
against him</em>, to destroy him without cause.’ And Satan answered the Lord,
and said: ‘… But put forth <em>Thy hand</em> now, and touch his bone and
his flesh, surely he will blaspheme Thee to Thy face.’ And the Lord said unto
Satan: ‘<em>Behold he is in thy hand; only spare his life</em>.’ So Satan went
forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole
of his foot even unto his crown” (2.3-7).<br>
The plain text makes it clear that Satan does nothing of his own volition, without
God’s permission and authority. First, God grants Satan permission to test Job,
and sets a limit—you may not touch him physically. Thereafter, God extends
that authority to permit physical torment, with a new limit—you may not
kill him. Satan is the “hand” put forth as God’s authorized agent. Blake graphically
portrays the story by showing Satan pointing towards the source of Job’s travail,
God, metaphorically represented by the tablets of the Ten Commandments.</span> He
then adds imagery not in the Bible—Satan points to his assistants who inflict
the <span class="notecall">tormenting nightmare.</span><span class="sidenote">In <em>Illustrations
of the Book of Job</em>, plate numbered 11 (<a href="#3.4">illus 3.4</a>), Blake describes in a
title line what he engraved (emphasis in italics): “Satan himself is transformed
into an <em>Angel</em> of Light &amp; his Ministers into <em>Ministers of Righteousness</em>.”
As a footnote, Blake quotes Job 7.14: “With Dreams upon my bed thou
scarest me &amp; affrightest me with Visions” (the Soncino edition has
“Then Thou scarest me with dreams, And terrifiest me through visions”). In this
lament, “thou” refers to God, not to Satan.</span> Blake deliberately
made the slogan appear to be a commandment—a visual illusion.<br>
<p>Later, when Blake prepared a set of the Job drawings for John Linnell, he
did not attempt to duplicate this ambitious use of Hebrew (illus. 3.3).

<p>In <em>Illustrations of the Book of Job</em>, only two plates have Hebrew,
each with two words. The first is the title page (illus. 3.5), in which artistically
embellished serif characters reflect the style of the English letters. Although
this license causes a distortion to the base of one letter, no ambiguity results
because the letter remains distinct and the context is unmistakable. The word
on the right translates as “book” and that on the left as “Job,” for “Job’s Book,”

Extended to the right beyond the vertical stroke, the baseline matches that of
letter “<span lang="he">ב</span>”‎ (02). This is improper,
because the extension is a feature unique to “<span lang="he">ב</span>”‎ (02)
to differentiate it from the similar “<span lang="he">כ</span>”‎ (11),
especially in sans serif. This may be artistic license, or not understanding
the import of the flourish. It is also possible that Blake mimics a style not
used today (see the discussion of <a href="#3.6.2j">illus. 3.6.2j</a>, below). He uses the “N” shape for “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎ (01).<br>

The left word is the tetragrammaton, which Blake apparently used to represent
the English words “Divine Presence,” although the Hebrew is usually translated
as “Lord” (and commonly transliterated as “Jehovah”). The three-letter right
word is problematic, because it translates as “king,” not “angel.” The two-word
phrase, if considered alone, is not a problem (“Lord the King” or “Jehovah the
King”). If Blake intended the Hebrew to represent “The Angel of the Divine Presence,”
however, he should have engraved the four-letter word for “angel,” which contains
the three letters used for “king”:

<p>Before we consider the riddle that is wrapped in this enigma of Blake’s calligraphy,
observe carefully the letter “<span lang="he">מ</span>”‎ (13).
For whatever reason, Blake here uses a cursive form of the letter. Curiously,
he is not consistent, because the letter “<span lang="he">ל</span>”‎ (12)
remains serif. Compare his letters for “king” (illus. 3.6.2) to the same word
from a twentieth-century book whose type is set in cursive (illus. 3.6.2a).

Again, none matches, for two reasons: first, Blake has an embellished flat base
extending to the right, and second, he has suppressed the protruding small stroke
that should be on the upper-left portion of the letter pointing upwards. He is
doing something different.<br>

</div>
Exaggerated ornamentation embellishes all letters in this unusual serif-style
typeface. It is possible that Blake knew and mimicked this style because his
letter “<span lang="he">פ</span>”‎ (17) in illus. 3.5.1
has the same extension of the baseline towards the right as the character in
illus. 3.6.2j. Nonetheless, Blake’s “<span lang="he">מ</span>”‎ (13)
significantly differs from illus. 3.6.2i.
<p>There is yet one more comparison to make. Christian D. Ginsburg (1831–1914)
was born in Poland a few years after Blake died and received a traditional Jewish
religious education. <span class="notecall">After emigrating to England as a
young man in 1846, he converted to Christianity, entered the circle of the London
Christian Hebraists, and eventually became a noted biblical scholar.</span><span class="sidenote">For
a biographical sketch of Ginsburg, see Bloch 583n.</span> Although the word in
illus. 3.6.2k was written some five decades after Blake died, it may be compared
with Blake’s style because Ginsburg studied Hebrew when a child, making him a
virtual contemporary. The five-letter word translates as “in the wilderness.”
It was selected because the letter “<span lang="he">ב</span>”‎ (02)
appears twice, with the right instance adjacent to the letter “<span lang="he">מ</span>”‎ (13).
Lastly, I place Blake’s and Ginsburg’s “king” side by side in illus. 3.6.2l.

</div>
Without question, Ginsburg was a skilled Hebraist who knew how to form Hebrew
characters. Not so Blake. <span class="notecall">The impression given by the
comparison is that Blake engraved “<span lang="he">ב</span>”‎ (02)
instead of the intended “<span lang="he">מ</span>”‎ (13).</span><span class="sidenote">Examination

<p>The next step of the analysis compares the <em>Job</em> plate (<a href="#3.6">illus.
3.6</a>) with another famous work by Blake, the <em>Laocoön</em> (illus. 3.7),
which has the same slogan, “The Angel of the Divine Presence.” <a name="3.7" id="3.7"></a>

<a name="3.7a" id="3.7a"></a>Blake incorporated Hebrew four times in the <em>Laocoön</em>.
A two-letter name for God, in perfectly formed serif letters, is at bottom left

<div class="illus"><img src="476.jpg" height="90" width="570"> </div>
<a name="3.7b" id="3.7b"></a>In the upper left is the Hebrew for Jesus, <span class="notecall">with two letters reversed (illus.

The letter “<span lang="he">ו</span>”‎ (06) functions as a vowel indicator. With the vowel omitted, the three letters <span style="white-space: nowrap">__16-21-10__</span>  mean “to save, to deliver,” as defined in Parkhurst’s lexicon (Parkhurst, 1762, <em>ECCO</em>
 image 157). Blake may be using the Hebrew to represent the concept of 
Christ as savior. However, he may have intended the actual name of 
Christ, because the Protestant theologians of his era promoted the study
 of Hebrew without vowels (points), a concept expressed in the full 
title of Parkhurst’s lexicon (see <a href="#Parkhurst">Works Cited</a> and Parkhurst, 1762, <em>ECCO</em> image 1).</span>

the tetragrammaton on the left, and “angel” on the right, but with a reversed “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎ (01)
and a nearly cursive “<span lang="he">מ</span>”‎ (13).
<div class="illus"><img src="479.jpg" height="180" width="500"> </div>
<p>Finally, with all the above in mind, it is now possible to consider (a) the
riddle posed by Blake’s misspelling “angel” in the <em>Job</em> plate by
omitting letter “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎ (01) when
he has it correct in the <em>Laocoön</em>; and (b) the enigma of the reversed
letter “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎ (01) in a word that
is so prominently and centrally displayed in the <em>Laocoön</em>.<br>
I begin by quoting Spector as representative of the scholarly discourse:
</p><blockquote>Blake’s work is <em>full of such inconsistencies</em>, not only within
single drawings, but among individual drawings as well. For example, at the top
of “The Laocoön” is the heading “The Angel of the Divine Presence,” followed
by a corrupt Hebrew version in which the <em>alef</em> [letter “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎ (01)]
of the word “angel” is reversed …. In contrast, the identical phrase heads
the … Job illustration, but here, Blake omits the <em>alef</em> entirely, leaving
us with … the Hebrew word for “king”…. <em>If we assume</em> that Blake did not
simply forget to include the <em>alef</em>, especially since he knew the word,
then <em>we must conclude that the corruption was deliberate</em>, <span class="notecall">though
the explanation for the alteration may defy our powers of analysis.</span><span class="sidenote">Spector,
“Blake as an Eighteenth-Century Hebraist” 202. Emphasis mine, except for the
word “<em>alef</em>.” See also 225n40.</span></blockquote>
The truth is sometimes to be found in the simplest theory (Occam’s razor). <span class="notecall">It
may be, as G. E. Bentley, Jr., suggests, that Blake made errors when doing Hebrew.</span><span class="sidenote">Bentley, <em>William
Blake’s Writings</em> 1: 664n.</span> How this could have occurred is suggested
in <span class="notecall">a letter by John Linnell where we learn that the “borders
[of the <em>Job</em> plates] were an afterthought, and designed as well as engraved
upon the copper <em>without a previous drawing</em>” (emphasis mine).</span><span class="sidenote">Bentley, <em>The
Stranger from Paradise</em> 396.</span> Because Blake worked on the <em>Job</em> borders
extemporaneously, it is possible that he did the same when adding words to the <em>Laocoön</em> plate. <span class="notecall">Rosamund
Paice so argues.</span><span class="sidenote">Paice argues that the words were
added late in Blake’s life: “The uneven spacing, and the mistakes, of the surrounding
text suggest that it probably was scratched and/or engraved straight into the
plate. … This suspicion is supported by the fact that the inscriptions
(including the signature line) appear to have been cut with a graver, and not
etched” (57).</span> This may be the cause of the errors—surely, Blake
was capable of human mistakes, no different from the many editors who attempt to reproduce his “ABC” “<span lang="he">אבג</span>‎” (see <a href="#errors">table 2</a>). However, for those who cannot accept fallibility in Blake, I propose
a more elaborate and speculative explanation.
<p>Who is, and where is, the angel in the two engravings? <span class="notecall">The
answer is obvious in the <em>Job</em> plate (<a href="#3.6">illus. 3.6</a>),
where Satan is front and center.</span><span class="sidenote">Blake places Satan
centrally in every <em>Job</em> engraving in which he appears.</span> What could
be more evident? Now examine the <em>Laocoön</em> (<a href="#3.7">illus. 3.7</a>).
How is Satan depicted? He is clearly off to the side, entangled and helpless
in the coils of Lilith, and identified as one of the two children of God (<a href="#3.7a">illus.
3.7a</a>). <span class="notecall">Here, he is a minor character in the composition,
unlabeled.</span><span class="sidenote">Lilith is labeled (<a href="#3.7c">illus.
3.7c</a>), but Satan and Adam are not.</span> Consider the four figures, as Blake
perceives them: God is not an angel—God is the creator; Lilith is a demon,
certainly no angel; Adam is a man, also not an angel; Satan is the angel. Now
examine the placement of the slogan (<a href="#3.7d">illus. 3.7d</a>). It is
not over the head of whichever of the two “sons” represents Satan, but directly
above God, as it is in the <em>Job</em> engraving (<a href="#3.6">illus. 3.6</a>).
Blake placed the English above the Hebrew, and the Hebrew above God, in both.
Why above God, when it clearly refers to an angel, which could only be Satan?
The answer, I suggest, is to consider that the Hebrew refers not to Satan at
all, but only to God.</p>
<p>We now consider the illusion in each engraving. <span class="notecall">The <em>Job</em> engravings
were published in 1826, and, by current judgment, the<em> Laocoön</em> is dated
afterwards.</span><span class="sidenote">For the history of the <em>Laocoön</em> and
an analysis of the imagery, see Essick, <em>Separate Plates</em> xxvii, 98-101. However, for the most recent scholarship on its dating, see the <em><a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/">William
Blake Archive</a></em>, which assigns a print date after the <em>Job</em>: “The
central image of the statue may have been executed as early as c. 1815 …. The
inscribed texts surrounding the statue were almost certainly added at a much
later date, c. 1826-27.” “Print Date: c. 1826-27” (Illuminated Books, <em>Laocoön</em>,
introduction and copy information for copy B, accessed 8 March 2010). Bentley
dates it “1826?” (<em>The Stranger from Paradise</em> 463).</span><br>
<em>Job</em>: A person whose primary language is English will instinctively read
from top left to bottom right, and on encountering the phrase “The Angel of the
Divine Presence” will probably assume that the words immediately below are a
Hebrew translation. The Hebraist will form the same assumption, then immediately
realize upon reading the Hebrew that it has a different interpretation:
</p><div class="extract"><img src="519.jpg" height="56" width="215"></div>
<!--<div class="Hebrew"><span lang="he" style="letter-spacing: 15px">&nbsp;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;&nbsp;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span><br />
&#8206; &#95;&#95;05-06-05-10&#95;&#95;11f-12-13&#95;&#95;<br />
LORD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KING</div>-->
The Hebraist, expecting the equivalent of the English “The Angel of the Divine
Presence,” instead perceives “Lord the King” (or “Jehovah the King”) and will
be confounded. The meaning becomes clear, however, if the Hebrew phrase is associated
with the image of God (“Lord the King”) immediately below, and not with Satan,
as implied by the word “angel” in the slogan above.<br>
<p>In this plate (<a href="#3.6">illus. 3.6</a>), Blake depicts three lines from
the biblical plain text. <span class="notecall">Job 1.6, quoted in small letters
at the very bottom of the plate,</span><span class="sidenote">As Blake engraves
it: “There was a day when the Sons of God came to present themselves before the
Lord &amp; Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord.”</span> sets
the stage. We see two parallel scenes: Heaven above, Earth below. In Heaven,
a radiant God sits enthroned, an open book in his lap, attended by the “Sons
of God,” all in contemplative study. <span class="notecall">On Earth, duplicating
the heavenly tableau, a righteous Job with book in hand converses with angels,
surrounded by his family, all in contemplative study.</span><span class="sidenote">The
heavenly scene is in Job 1.6. Blake includes the earthly scene because of Job
1.8.</span> God calls Satan to account for his whereabouts; the latter replies
that he was traveling the world <span class="notecall">(1.7: “And the Lord said
unto Satan: ‘Whence comest thou?’ Then Satan answered the Lord, and said: ‘From
going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it’”).</span><span class="sidenote">Soncino
edition.</span> Blake depicts this by showing a pensive God looking at Satan,
who is in mid-stride. Next, in Job 1.8, God asks Satan: <span class="notecall">“Hast
thou considered My servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a whole-hearted
and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil?”</span><span class="sidenote">Soncino
edition.</span> Blake shows this by words and image: the words are in an arc
at the top of the plate, <span class="notecall">and the image shows God pointing
down towards Job.</span><span class="sidenote">Thereafter, in Job 1.9-12, Satan
issues the challenge that God should test Job, and God authorizes Satan to so
do (see <a href="#challenge">note</a> above).</span> He further emphasizes God
by engraving phrases above and below that refer to God in one manner or another.
The composition of this plate, therefore, has God at the top and Job, a mortal
on Earth, necessarily at the bottom. Only midpoint remains for Satan. Blake does
not place Satan there because of his prominence and importance, but because of
compositional demands. Satan is subordinate to God, who is paramount, and the
focus is on God’s role in the Job story. This is the context necessary to understand
the Hebrew slogan.
</p><p>Now we consider the three central title lines. All are about God. In an arc,
Blake engraved “Hast thou considered my Servant Job,” the question posed by God.
The second line identifies whom it is that God is addressing (see <a href="#3.4">illus.
3.4</a>, describing Satan as an “Angel”).
The third, in Hebrew, labels the image of God. Associating Hebrew with God is
not a new theme for Blake; three decades earlier, in <em>Night Thoughts</em>,
he shows God with a scroll of Hebrew letters (see <a href="#1.1">illus. 1.1</a>),
and the Hebrew slogan on the open book represents God, to whose heavenly realm the triumphant queen points (see <a href="#1.4">illus. 1.4</a>).<br>
The perception of a wrong translation is just an illusion caused by considering
only the second and third lines without the overall context. It matters not if
Blake deliberately or inadvertently created the illusion. If deliberate, the
English reference to an angel would be a red herring to mislead the Hebraist.
If inadvertent, we may imagine Blake’s surprise when a Hebraist complained that
he erred because the Hebrew for “angel” (<span lang="he">מלאך</span>‎)
is misspelled. Whichever, it is an illusion of a translation. By the overall
context, Blake intended “king” (<span lang="he">מלך</span>‎),
and that is what we see.</p>
<p><em>Laocoön</em>: The Hebrew words with the largest letters act as a headline
or banner to attract the eye. The non-Hebraist, for whom the words convey no
meaning, will probably assume that the Hebrew is the equivalent of the English
engraved immediately above: “The Angel of the Divine Presence.” The Hebraist
will immediately understand the two Hebrew words as a phrase to mean “The Lord’s
Angel” (or “Jehovah’s Angel”), a translation perfectly consistent with the English.
</p><div class="extract"><img src="520.jpg" height="56" width="248"></div>
<!--<div class="Hebrew"><span lang="he" style="letter-spacing: 15px">&nbsp;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498;&nbsp;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span><br />

LORD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANGEL</div>-->
However, the Hebraist will simultaneously recognize that something is wrong,
because the “<span lang="he">א</span>”‎ (01) is reversed.
The reversal is a clue. Upon deliberately reconsidering the word with the offending
letter deleted, the Hebraist will suddenly perceive “king” (<span lang="he">מלך</span>‎)
in place of “angel” (<span lang="he">מלאך</span>‎).
The translation becomes “Lord, the King,” a title consistent with the central
figure of the <em>Laocoön</em>, whom Blake conceptualizes to be a representation
of God.<br>
Spector supposes that Blake could not have erred because he knew the Hebrew words
for “angel” and “king” (“Blake as an Eighteenth-Century Hebraist” 202). If not
by error, then he did it for a purpose. I offer two suggestions for the reversed
letter in the <em>Laocoön</em>. Perhaps Blake intended the Hebrew to convey a
double meaning: “angel,” as a translation of the English slogan above,
and “king,” as a label for the image below. It could, however, be
another red herring to reinforce the illusion of a translation. Ignore the offending
reversed letter, and the word becomes “king.” <span class="notecall">The critical
concept is to recognize that the Hebrew banner is immediately above God, not
above Satan, just as we see in the <em>Job</em>.</span><span class="sidenote">Linnell
studied Greek and Hebrew; his biographer, Alfred Thomas Story, tells of his learning
Hebrew (and Greek) after conversion to the Baptist communion in 1812 in order
to study the Bible. His teacher was Thomas Palmer, his future father-in-law,
described as having “a good knowledge of Hebrew.” Story is of the opinion that “[Linnell]
does not appear to have carried his studies very far … at that time, and they
were probably soon relinquished.” In 1843, he resumed serious study and gained
a degree of competence (Story vol. 1, ch. 5; vol. 2, ch. 7). On the relationship
between Blake and Linnell, Story says: “A similarity of thought between the two
men soon led to a very close intimacy between them, and they remained fast friends
until the death of the elder closed as kindly a chapter of friendship as is anywhere
to be met with in the annals of art or literature” (vol. 1, ch. 12).<br>
The modern revision of Story’s biography by Linnell’s great-grandson offers this
comment about Linnell’s meeting Blake for the first time on 24 June 1818: “The
two men seem to have taken to each other at once. Linnell was then twenty-six
and Blake sixty-one. Their friendship lasted until Blake’s death, ten years later
in 1827. Linnell was obviously fascinated by this man whose art and writings
reflected so strongly a special image of God. He was surprised to discover that
Blake too had learned Greek and Hebrew, and this immediately put their discussions
about religion on a special footing” (D. Linnell 53).<br>
The implication of all this is that at the time that Blake was engraving the <em>Job</em> and
the <em>Laocoön</em> Hebrew slogans, Linnell had some command of Hebrew (the
extent of which is unknown). One may suspect that they discussed the Hebrew as
work on the plates progressed. If discussions did occur, and if Linnell understood
the difference in the Hebrew spelling of “king” and “angel,” then
what Blake engraved was for a purpose. In the absence of documentary evidence,
however, the vetting of Blake’s Hebrew by Linnell remains just an enticing speculation.</span><br>
Blake’s motive for introducing Hebrew wordplays into his art is argued in a forthcoming
paper, <em>Blake’s Priestly Blessing: God Blesses Job</em>.
<p class="subtitle">Conclusion</p>
<p>These few samples of Blake’s Hebrew calligraphy may not be statistically representative
or relevant. Considered in and of themselves, the images from the period before
1803 indicate a lack of command over the written character. Although the Butts
watercolors demonstrate Blake’s great artistic mastery, they do not demonstrate
mastery of the Hebrew alphabet. The Hebrew words from
the <em>Job</em> and <em>Laocoön</em> engravings are properly formed, but imply
a confusion in the spelling of the words “angel”
and “king,” if not part of a deliberate illusion. Blake may also
be distorting Hebrew characters for an ulterior purpose in support of a personal
theology. His graphic representations of Hebrew show only what the eye can see,
and tell no tale of how they came into being. If these specimens are typical
of Blake’s written Hebrew, however, then they may be a measure of his command
of the language.</p>
