      <td class="body">I remember being introduced to a senior scholar 
at a summer Huntington Library lawn party a generation ago and his 
inquiring politely, “Well, what’s your angle?” Stephen Dedalus’s inner 
panic to “say something” flashed to Steelyard the Lawgiver’s <em>Island in the Moon</em>
 reassurance that “every person has a something” as I fumbled to come up
 with a dissertation abstract. Those more than thirty years past rise 
again in contemplating the analogous age differences between the two 
sets of contributors to this <em>Romantic Circles</em> electronic 
collection, which presents the efforts of four “younger Blake editors 
and scholars” and three “established” ones. The latter, Mary Lynn 
Johnson, W. H. Stevenson, and David Fuller, are doubtless familiar to 
subscribers of this journal for their three different “successful print 
editions” of “texts designed to appeal to first-time readers of Blake,” 
while the former, Rachel Lee, J. Alexandra McGhee, and co-editors Wayne 
C. Ripley and Justin Van Kleeck, “have all worked as project assistants 
to the <em>Blake Archive</em> and received their graduate training from 
its editors” (introduction, par. 4; Johnson, par. 2). With the concise 
print elders accounting for less than a third of the volume (in my 
printout, anyway, and not counting the errata sheet for Johnson and 
Grant’s second edition, for which there is no editorially supplied print
 option), and the organizers’ point taken that “Stevenson, Johnson, and 
Fuller all see their editions being used in connection with the <em>Blake Archive</em>”
 (introduction, par. 7), the juxtaposition carries the sense of staged 
generational baton-passing to celebrate the expanding empire of the <em>Blake Archive</em>.</td>

    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">2</td>
      <td class="body">There is also a curious sense that the senior 
three serve as a stalking-horse for the dismissal of “immersive 
textuality.” The introduction, by Ripley, notes that the collection 
(generally referred to as just “<em>Editing Blake</em>”) might in some respects be seen as a companion to Ron Broglio’s effort in the same series five years previous, <em>Digital Designs on Blake</em>. But, he notes, “instead of employing the model of the archive common to electronic editions like the <em>Blake Archive</em>,
 Broglio offers ‘immersive textuality’ as a model for engaging literary 
works from within” (par. 5). Arguing that “most of the electronic 
heuristics explored by <em>Digital Designs</em> have had a very brief shelf life and limited popular appeal” and that “print media and the self-declared ‘conservative’ <em>Blake Archive</em>
 are the primary means by which almost all of Blake’s readers engage his
 works” (par. 5), the introduction returns in its concluding paragraph 
to “Stevenson, Johnson, and Fuller, whose integration of the general 
reader into their editorial vision should be the model for any future 
uses of immersive textuality in approaching Blake” (par. 35).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">3</td>
      <td class="body">As for the “angles” and “something” of the new 
age, these appear to include “remediation,” “editioning,” and 
“delineation editing.” By far the most common is “remediation,” imported
 from Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin’s 1999 book of that title and 
used to denote the changes in form, content, circulation, and meaning 
that accompany the translation of a work from one medium to another. The
 introduction, for instance, finds it “noteworthy” that the <em>Blake Digital Text Project</em> [<em>BDTP</em>] “made digitizing Erdman’s <em>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</em>
 an early priority, presumably for the purpose of improving the text 
through [its] remediation” (par. 7). What was posted in 1997 for the 
purpose of convenience was the source text for the project’s 
concordance—complete with the rather obviously added identification of 
each line and page for the primitive search program—and this is 
described, dramatically and anachronistically, as being “silent in how 
[its] remediation altered” the Erdman text, with a screen shot to 
illustrate. These obvious changes in the <em>BDTP</em> version, plus others introduced in the <em>Blake Archive</em>
 instance of that source text, lead to the portentous suggestion that 
“although neither copy is a new edition, these significant differences 
mean that the standard edition of Blake now exists in three versions. Do
 these variations call into question the authority of the letterpress 
edition itself, and inasmuch as they mirror the variations found in the 
original prints, do they direct readers to print and digital facsimiles?
 Or will a reader simply take the digitization at face value …?” (par. 
8). To recycle the words of the Santa Cruz Blake Study Group, 
twenty-eight years back, “would it be such apostasy to say that <em>none of this matters</em> …?” (<em>Blake</em> 18.1 [summer 1984]: 14). Nothing escapes remediation, it appears, but while “the exceptional influence of the [<em>Blake</em>] <em>Archive</em>
 demands a detailed understanding of how it remediates Blake” (par. 22),
 we are told at the same time of a print edition that “remedies [its] 
remediation by referring readers to the Princeton-Blake Trust Series and
 the <em>Blake Archive</em>” (par. 31).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">4</td>
      <td class="body">Proposer and co-editor of the collection, Justin 
Van Kleeck foregrounds his angle with the first word of his prolix 
contribution, “Editioning William Blake’s <em>VALA/The Four Zoas</em>.” 
While editing “represents a unique act of ‘interpretation,’” in his 
account, “so, too, does what I call ‘editioning,’ or the process of 
turning some original work into a distinct object and work” through 
editing it in an edition (par. 3). An edition (or “editioning”) “then, 
is an interpretation-in-print, not to mention a critical argument about 
how Blake can (and should?) be edited” (par. 47). While we hear little 
of the actual interpretations inhering in its editions, we are assured 
that although “Blake’s restless manuscript” is “safely stowed away in a 
British Library safe,” “ambiguity abounds in the <em>VALA/Four Zoas</em> manuscript resting peacefully in a library safe” (pars. 9, 18, 19).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">5</td>
      <td class="body">According to his co-editor Ripley, Van Kleeck 
surveys the editionings of “Keynes, Margoliouth, Erdman, Bentley, and 
Stevenson in masterful detail, providing a valuable and lasting 
contribution to the editorial history of the work” (introduction, par. 
24). For this reader, though, what abides is the focus on the “highly 
fragile and highly valuable manuscript as a ‘Z-Safe Restricted’ 
work—which, translated from the argot, means that it <em>stays</em> in 
the safe almost without exception” (Van Kleeck, par. 80). Fortunately 
for his essay, with the help of a recommendation that “literally 
‘cracked the safe’” for him, Van Kleeck had “the truly unique chance” to
 study the manuscript and “engage it in brief Intellectual Battle” (note
 36; par. 82). The experience left him with “newfound respect” for those
 editors who “tried their best to represent it in some way,” the 
realization of “just how inadequate any edition would be” (par. 82), and
 regret “that many scholars, and even general readers, likely will never
 get to see the stunning, intimidating, and tantalizing work” (par. 83).
 Returning from his battle he “repaid” his recommender “with a two-day 
crash course on the manuscript, which I believe still has him woozy” 
(note 36). If this writing is a sample, he may be right. In any event, 
considerations of article editing aside, it is good to know that the<em> Blake Archive</em> editioning of <em>VALA/The Four Zoas</em>
 is proceeding, and that “along with the fresh transcriptions will be 
fresh (and I must say spectacular) full-color digital images at 
unprecedented 300 dpi resolution” (par. 65).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">6</td>
      <td class="body">Wayne C. Ripley’s unillustrated “Delineation 
Editing of Co-Texts: William Blake’s Illustrations” identifies its 
subject as “a specifically Blakean notion of social-text editing” (par. 
7). Ripley is concerned with Blake’s many illustrations to the works of 
others and through delineation editing seeks “to expand the editorial 
frame beyond the illustrations themselves to encompass their material 
and social realities” (par. 7). His strong argument is that the “source 
texts” for the illustrations “be considered ‘co-texts’” that “function 
in their own socio-historical network” (par. 11) and deserve full 
representation in the <em>Blake Archive</em> that at present “excludes 
much, if not all, of the original works that spurred the illustrations, 
omits the physical context in which the design exists, and leaves out 
paratextual features such as prefaces, epigraphs, and even blank leaves 
that Blake may have considered as part of the field for constructing his
 meaning” (par. 12).</td>

      <td class="body">In “‘The productions of time’: Visions of Blake 
in the Digital Age,” Rachel Lee and J. Alexandra McGhee relate their 
“experiences editing Blake’s manuscript, <em>An Island in the Moon</em>” for the <em>Blake Archive</em>
 (par. 7). While “forthcoming” at the time of their publication, its 
availability online was announced just in time for me to check whether 
Steelyard the Lawgiver’s assurance recalled above was that “every body” 
or “every person has a something.” It was “person,” but, to my surprise,
 here he or she has not “a something” but “as something.” And the 300 
dpi enlargement certainly depicts what looks like a cursive “a” with a 
cursive “s” attached, with an editorial note in the transcription 
(object 8, line 12) asserting that “the last word of the line is ‘as’, 
though Bentley (<em>Writings</em> volume 2, page 885) and Erdman (page 456) read ‘a’ without comment.” (While the authors state that “the <em>Archive</em>
 includes variant readings from Phillips, G. E. Bentley, and David 
Erdman within text notes” [note 12] and offer a detailed example of 
another transcription by Michael Phillips in note 11, his reading of “a 
something” goes unmentioned in the <em>Blake Archive</em> textual note. 
That any such omission is not an oversight of Lee and McGhee is made 
clear by the archive’s “Electronic Edition Information” “Statement of 
Responsibility,” which identifies as editors of the manuscript only 
Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi.)</td>

parts, the document type definition or DTD that defines the mark-up tags
 to be used and their hierarchical order, and the tagged or marked-up 
content. The tag set is thus crucial, as it establishes the parameters 
of what can be marked up and processed for particular display (using a 
style-sheet language, XSL, and program, XSLT, which can transform the 
XML markup into widely varying formats). Unfortunately, while the 
authors direct us to “see ‘Manuscript Tag Set’” (par. 19), it is nowhere
 on offer, though it would appear that it “integrat[es]” at least some 
of the current Text Encoding Initiative guidelines (par. 28). Other of 
their references, to “Filling out an XML BAD File” (par. 19), for 
example (BAD here is evidently an acronym for Blake Archive 
Description), appear to invoke inaccessible private sites.</td>

      <td class="body">Repeated claims for the importance of 
transparency (e.g., pars. 32, 33, 45) notwithstanding, the source code 
or markup version of the transcription does not appear to be available 
to readers of the <em>Blake Archive</em>, so it is impossible to 
consider fully the claim that “XML is a better archiving and editing 
tool” or that “previously published works in the <em>Blake Archive</em> …
 will benefit from the updated tag set” (pars. 15, 20). For example, the
 authors state that their “decisions about how to encode … sections of 
backwards text in <em>Island</em> can be retroactively applied to the 
Illuminated Books that also contain mirror writing” (note 6). The 
transcription of the reversed text in object 18, line 10, however, is 
perfectly straightforward, with only a textual note to explain that “the
 letters ‘Bl’ (followed by an uncertain letter ‘a’) are written in 
backwards lettering.” Updated encoding that serves to trigger a textual 
note is surely an improvement over no notice at all. Also on the same 
object, readers will note the transcription in line 8 which reads, in 
its entirety, “<span style="font-size:12px">Lamb</span> [b in gray font] <span id="lamb">n [in blue font] n █</span>”.
 Setting aside accessibility concerns as to how sight-impaired readers 
will know, for instance, that gray font denotes “unclear or conjectural 
text,” it would be an interesting exercise for the reader to link to 
object 18 and find “Lamb” in short order (hint: the “L” of “Lamb” is 
below the initial stroke of the “n” and the word as a whole underneath 
that letter at about one-fifth its size) and to decide whether the 
transcription honors “the <em>Archive</em>’s concern with Blake’s revisions and the physicality of the page” (par. 22).</td>

      <td class="body">In their concluding paragraphs, Lee and McGhee 
note that “increasingly, visions of future electronic editions put more 
of the editorial process in the hands of the reader.” They cite Peter 
Robinson’s conception of “‘fluid, co-operative and distributed 
editions’” as a “model of scholarly edition which opens itself to 
readerly interrogation and intervention” (par. 43). But the prospect is 
no sooner offered than replaced with Thomas Tanselle’s writing in 1996 
to maintain “the necessity of historical expertise and the vital role 
specialists play in interpreting textual artifacts of the past.” After 
all, they finish with Tanselle, readers “do retain the power of choosing
 how much of the critical apparatus and scholarly research to 
incorporate into their reading” (par. 44). (So much for the imposition 
of “editioning”!)</td>

Robinson and Tanselle, Lee and McGhee conclude that “regardless of 
whether readers actually encode and edit electronic editions, the future
 of scholarly digital projects still rests with its [<em>sic</em>] readers” (par. 45). But given that “the <em>Blake Archive</em>’s
 primary purpose is for studying Blake rather than reading him” and that
 its “primary audience is a scholarly one” (note 8), one senses the 
predicament concerning audience underlying their disclosure that 
“uncertainty about the long-term future of the <em>Blake Archive</em> … motivates our goals and decisions today …” (par. 46).</td>

      <td class="body">Turning to the print editors, less needs to be 
said. In the collection’s shortest piece, “The Ends of Editing,” W. H. 
Stevenson writes that “the first duty of an editor is to present an 
accurate and useful text” (par. 5). But, as a “modernizing” editor, he 
argues that “from time to time” and “in pursuit of clarity and ease of 
understanding,” an editor “has to take minor liberties with the minutiae
 of Blake’s text” (par. 19). The “only justification” for such tampering
 is that “to do so brings us nearer to Blake” (par. 26). Most modern 
readers, however, will probably agree with the introduction’s 
characterization of Stevenson’s (and Fuller’s) changing of “The Tyger” 
to “The Tiger” as “wince-inducing” (introduction, par. 30). Evoking the 
characterization of Autolycus in <em>The Winter’s Tale</em> as “a 
snapper-up of unconsidered trifles,” Stevenson offers the memorable 
observation that “Blake’s Autolycus mind snapped up all manner of 
fascinating wayside material in any kind of order” (par. 34).</td>

      <td class="body">David Fuller, in “Modernizing Blake’s Text: 
Syntax, Rhythm, Rhetoric,” draws very extensively and apparently without
 notice from the introduction to his 2000 <em>William Blake: Selected Poetry and Prose</em>
 (reprinted by Pearson Longman in 2008; see pp. 18-26 in either). The 
final eight paragraphs turn to a different kind of re-writing (“my 
re-writings here” [par. 23]) that re-spaces Blake’s lines “to reveal 
features of the rhetorical structure of Blake’s poetry that are 
concealed by the conventions of its formal structure” (par. 23).</td>

      <td class="body">Mary Lynn Johnson’s entertaining “Contingencies, 
Exigencies, and Editorial Praxis: The Case of the 2008 Norton Blake” 
offers an “anecdotal case history” of the “fortuities and mundanities” 
leading up to the second edition—after twenty-nine years—of the Norton 
Critical Edition she published with “co-editor John E. Grant (husband 
Jack)” (pars. 3, 1). In this behind-the-scenes report, we see her 
“proclaim by e-mail, a little pompously,” “wail” to her editor, and 
“wheedle sympathy” (pars. 4, 12, 13) in the “nitty-gritty trade-offs and
 editorial histrionics” (par. 23) that make up the long back-story of 
getting the book to press. In keeping with every other contributor, she 
does not provide data on actual number of copies printed or sold (or 
site hits), but she does candidly offer specifics on the permissions 
budget and other constraints. Anyone who uses the new Norton will find 
the account rewarding, just as readers of Fuller’s and Stevenson’s 
editions, or users of the <em>Blake Archive</em>, will gain from the 
inside stories of these respective versions of Blake, forgiving what 
they do not approve and loving all for such energetic exertion of 
talent.</td>
