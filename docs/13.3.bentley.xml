          <p>In November 1977 Blackwell’s Antiquarian Department (Ship Street, Oxford) had two works of
minor Blake interest:</p>
          <p>(1) A Copy of Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Ballads</hi> (1805) bearing the familiar Blake plates but
also containing a loosely inserted duplicate leaf of pages 109-10 in a variant setting. The variants are few
and minor—“lo!” for “lo”, for example—but the existence of variants in the text has not hitherto been
suspected. Perhaps there is an undetected re-issue of the work. Certainly the book survives in a large number
of copies today.</p>
          <p>(2) A loose etching (21.1 × 32.8 cm) representing, at the top, a massive blasted oak with three
cows under it, signed “<hi rend="i">WB. del Nov 16.<hi rend="s">th</hi> 1809.</hi>” Beneath it is etched a
poem:
<q><hi rend="i">The Oak in Penshurst Park</hi><lb/>
<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Under which Sir Philip Sydney is said to have composed his Arcadia.</hi><lb/>
<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Hail! reverend Oak, with giant arms outspread</hi>,<lb/>
<hi rend="i">In hoary grandeur lift thy leafless head</hi>,<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Still rise the glory of the neighbouring lands</hi>,<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Nor dread the touch of sacrilegious hands:</hi><lb/>
<hi rend="i">For many a tow’ring elm, and stately oak</hi><lb/>
<hi rend="i">Shall bow submissive to the woodman’s stroke</hi>,<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Whilst thou shalt triumph ’midst surrounding fate</hi><lb/>
<hi rend="i">The last memorial of the good and great:</hi><lb/>
<hi rend="i">And still shall flourish through the lapse of years</hi>,<lb/>
<hi rend="i">What Sydney’s fame protects and Sydney’s worth endears.</hi><lb/>
<lb/>
<hi rend="i">F D C.</hi></q></p>
          <p>The leaf is a mystery to me. For one thing, I do not know where it came from, beyond the fact
that it was loosely inserted in a copy of Hayley’s <hi rend="i">Romney</hi> (1809) (which does have a
genuine and integral Blake plate dated 1809) and given me by Mr. Manners of Blackwell’s. For another, though
I have found a number of poems on the Penshurst Oak<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n39"
type="note">1</ref> (and even a representation of it<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n40"
type="note">2</ref>), I know of none by F. D. C. or containing these lines. The lines <hi rend="i">ought</hi>
to be by Francis Coventry (d. ?1759), who did write a poem on Penshurst, but he did not have a middle initial
beginning with D, and his Penshurst poem does not contain these lines. I suspect that it is by Frances Dorothy
Cartwright (1780-1863), who signed the dedication to her <hi rend="i">Poems, Chiefly Devotional</hi> (1835) as
“F. D. C.”—but this, apparently her only volume of poetry, does not contain the relevant poem, though it has
others of 1802-1835. <note id="n39"><hi rend="s">1</hi> Ben Jonson, “To Penshurst”; Edmund Waller, “At
Pens-hurst” (addressed to Lady Dorothy Sidney, his Sacharessa); Francis Coventry, “Penshurst” (in 
<hi rend="i">A Collection of Poems in Six Volumes</hi> By Several Hands [ed. J. Dodsley] (1782), IV, 55-56—it is
also in editions of 1755 and 1763.
                            <p>I have received generous advice concerning the poem, the engraving, Penshurst,
and Sir Philip Sidney from Jean Bromley (University of Southampton), Dr. Felix Hull (Kent County Archivist),
John Buxton (New College, Oxford), Viscount De L’Isle (Penshurst Place, Tonbridge, Kent), John Flower (The
Yews, Penshurst), and Robert Essick (University of California, Riverside).</p></note>
	<note id="n40"><hi rend="s">2</hi> “Sir Philip Sidney’s Oak” is reproduced in Jacob George Strutt’s 
<hi rend="i">Silva Britannica</hi> (1822[-1825]), Plate XXVIII, along with poems by Jonson, Waller, and Charlotte
Smith. (Sonnet XLVI “Written at Penshurst in Autumn 1788” in her <hi rend="i">Elegaic Sonnets</hi> [1795]).
The tree was 25′ 11″ in girth on 27 September 1794 when Joseph Farington made a drawing of it (Farington,
<hi rend="i">Diary</hi>, I [1798], 243) and still stands today.</note></p>
          <p>For another, though Blake lived in Sussex in 1800-1803, not so very far from Penshurst,
Kent,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n41" type="note">3</ref> and could have gone there, the
design is not strikingly like his, and Professor Robert Essick thinks the signature and stipple work unlike
Blake’s. There are very few tree-scapes by William Blake, and no cow-scapes at all.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n42" type="note">4</ref> A number of other artists and engravers with the same
initials were working at this time,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n43" type="note">5</ref>
and one of these may have been responsible. Probably William Blake’s proximity to Penshurst in 1800-1803,
the identity of the initials on the engraving with his, the appropriateness of his profession, and the source
of this copy of the print in a book with a Blake engraving of the same year are all just coincidences. It
seems quite unlikely that the author of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> had anything to
do with the Penshurst Oak. This is a pity, for it would be agreeable to connect him thus with Sir Philip
Sidney and with Percy Bysshe Shelley, to whose family the Penshurst property had passed by marriage. 
<note id="n41"><hi rend="s">3</hi> The great house at Penshurst burned down in 1793.</note>
	<note id="n42"><hi rend="s">4</hi> There <hi rend="i">was</hi> a proposal in 1802 that Blake should engrave
Mr. Spilsbury’s “drawing of M<hi rend="s">rs</hi> Poyntz’s <hi rend="i">Prize Bull</hi>” 
(<hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> [1969], 100), but nothing came of it so far as is known today. In the 1820s Blake
was rescued from the prospect of “making a set of Morland’s pig and ploughboy subjects” by commissions from
<corr type="emend">Linnell</corr> (ibid., p. 274).</note>
	<note id="n43"><hi rend="s">5</hi> Samuel Redgrave, <hi rend="i">A Dictionary of Artists of the English
School</hi> (1874) gives the following men working about 1809: Captain <hi rend="i">William Baillie</hi>
