		<q>
Of the fried brains of primal existence,<lb/>
When Eternals ate out of golden bricks and bottles<lb/>
And gave Blake a place in our mouths,<lb/>
Loud, audacious, out of order and solitary.<lb/>
<lb/>
Gadzooks, I hear your call gladly.<lb/>
Dictate your lunacies to me so that even Joan can’t hear them<lb/>
And leave me to the task of relation.

1. Lo, a shade of melancholy is risen<lb/>
In London! Dark, snappy to the touch<lb/>
Is this demon of the mind who rasps<lb/>
Throats in the courses of time.<lb/>
It could be Blake, say some thoughtless fools<lb/>
But we all know it is Sir Joshua.<lb/>
<lb/>
2. Lots of times he figured, &amp; moan’d<lb/>
Word by word in his attic room,<lb/>
Unseen, unknown! changes appeared<lb/>
Like Bad Art, twisted into horror<lb/>
By the Multi-colored demons of Blot and Blur.<lb/>
<lb/>
3. For he strove in battles dire,<lb/>
In unseen conflicts with shapes<lb/>
Bred of his comely mistresses<lb/>
Of beast, bird, fish, serpent &amp; element,<lb/>
Combustion, blast, vapour and cloud.<lb/>
<lb/>
4. Dark, like the children of the chimneys,<lb/>
He hid in his private coffin,<lb/>
With activity unknown and horrible;<lb/>
A Poet without a poem,<lb/>
In a huge jar of ink.<lb/>
<lb/>
5. But Tygers beheld his vast possibilities;<lb/>
Ages on ages they lay, waiting to win him over.<lb/>
Till finally they smelled his time<lb/>
And burned an idea bright into his mind.<lb/>
<lb/>
6. His trusty pen now ready, weird Blake<lb/>
Prepar’d: his ten thousands of blunders<lb/>
Rang’d in prolific array, stretch from London into America<lb/>
And the rolling of his wheels can be heard for miles.<lb/>
Like twisting wrestlers his groans can be heard<lb/>
In the Alps, in Greece, in the heart of Venice,<lb/>
And even in your own mind.<lb/>
Is nothing sacred to this mixer of sorrows<lb/>
But guinea-like suns and innocent lambs?

			<q>
1. Art was not: nor truth of perception<lb/>
The will of Blake was not yet born,<lb/>
He twitched and turned in<lb/>
Eternal life, before his death arrived.<lb/>
<lb/>
2. The sound of a baby, the people<lb/>
Awoke, &amp; vast clouds of tears roll’d<lb/>
Down the dull eyes of the world, so called<lb/>
It by Blake, the new born.<lb/>
<lb/>
3. Loud the crying, like that of an error.<lb/>
Now was the earth prepared to accept its new christ,<lb/>
The carpets rolled out and minds split open<lb/>
Words passed lips like Roberts? and Grahm?<lb/>
Crying was heard in Santa Fe<lb/>
And rumors had it that He was only a copy.<lb/>
<lb/>
4. But he spoke like a man, with<lb/>
A man’s empty eyes, and seemed to<lb/>
Look through you rather than at you.<lb/>
“Here alone I, in place of yourself,<lb/>
“Know what you are and what you desire.<lb/>
“I know what is cold and I know what is fire<lb/>
“I’ve written a book, it’s a must for you all<lb/>
“Read it and praise it as lackeys you must.<lb/>
<lb/>
5. “Lo! Am I divine as I search with your souls,<lb/>
“For Innocence, Experience, Los and<lb/>
“Of course, Luvah. Give me a handle<lb/>
“So we can all be friends,<lb/>
“Under one Heaven, One God<lb/>
“One King, one Law, one society<lb/>
“One curse, one rule, why of course, it’s me.”

			<q>
1. The voice ended: they saw his waxed moustache<lb/>
Emerge from his changing lip; his hand<lb/>
On the empty bottle grasping for a<lb/>
Look at eternity. Inspiration seized the weak,<lb/>
<lb/>
2. Spasms of desire, intense need<lb/>
In epileptic dronings of rye and barley<lb/>
In whirlwinds of yeast and molasses<lb/>
And enormous forms of energy;<lb/>
All the seven heavy ingredients of sin.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n17"
type="note">2</ref><lb/>
In gallon form appear’d,<lb/>
In the flames of Blake’s vast still.<lb/>
<lb/>
3. Thunder and lightning, and Southern<lb/>
Comfort too, then fire burst out in the north end<lb/>
Of town, where Blake’s fine army had bedded down<lb/>
And angry yelps could be heard from above<lb/>
Where his wife lay waiting for her imprisoned Orc.<lb/>
<lb/>
4. But no fire came from the fire, and<lb/>
No light from the light because it wasn’t there.<lb/>
<lb/>
5. Then Blake raised his arm and up<lb/>
Came Urizen; like an elevator boy he<lb/>
Danced at his command, and the only one<lb/>
Gone was Los, who had hidden in the valley<lb/>
<pb id="p19-123" n="123"/>
Between UBlake and Mars and ate fruit in the <lb/>
Faces of the Eternals.<lb/>
<lb/>
6. Los didn’t like the leechy Urizen<lb/>
As Blake gave him plenty of Hell.<lb/>
And Blake didn’t like the bellowing Los<lb/>
As Orc wouldn’t let him leave his side. <note id="n17"><hi rend="s">2</hi> This line stained by a drink in

1. At a los was the world as they Watched the Blake grow.<lb/>
<lb/>
2. He whimpered and cursed And drove himself wild.<lb/>
<lb/>
3. They soon grew to rue the day of the Tears<lb/>
<lb/>
4. And asked Willy Boy would he give Them a break.

1. Ages on ages roll’d over him<lb/>
As he sought for a world winning stance.<lb/>
Till finally he found that the right<lb/>
Recipe was christ with a little romance.<lb/>
<lb/>
2. He pleaded his case in darkness at first<lb/>
Beating his head on his desk,<lb/>
But every desk he finally marred<lb/>
Was replaced with a new point of view<lb/>
So he turned his restless eyes<lb/>
To the sun and winced with pain when<lb/>
He saw an eclipse formed an image of<lb/>
Dancing men as carollers chimed at his door.<lb/>
<lb/>
3. Lo! I have it indeed, in<lb/>
Darkness I no longer dwell, I<lb/>
Smell the green of a wonderful faith<lb/>
And the aroma of my own dirty socks.<lb/>
<lb/>
4. And the world shook with his might<lb/>
As the demons were gassed and burned,<lb/>
Painters were sent to Sigh beereeya for<lb/>
Their blasphemous errors of sight.<lb/>
The truth was clear to his tuned in ear<lb/>
The truth was right and that was he.<lb/>
<lb/>
5. He carved a man out of the sky,<lb/>
In spiraling descent, he reached<lb/>
The ground, as Urizen, the evil,<lb/>
With the world as a hoax, and the freedom<lb/>
To twist his own imagination to<lb/>
Terrible deeds of the senses.

			<q>
1. Yes, Blake ate at diners, and<lb/>
Sampled the human art, he drew fine<lb/>
Portraits of human acts and painted on their<lb/>
Flimsy canvas. But he finally decided<lb/>
To deform the human art.<lb/>
No more could they draw at will<lb/>
Fine pieces of life, but bound to<lb/>
Blake by the majesty of truth<lb/>
They cowered in awe of eternity.<lb/>
<lb/>
2. Their children wept, &amp; built<lb/>
Temples to his faces,<lb/>
And followed his wise advice<lb/>
And called him God.<lb/>
<lb/>
3. And his mystery remains<lb/>
Surrounded by laughter, now caus’d<lb/>
By demons of satire and cynic.<lb/>
<lb/>
4. The remaining songs of UBlake<lb/>
Beheld their scorn and shrunk together<lb/>
Beneath the Net of Bell.<lb/>
Persuasion was in vain;<lb/>
For the ears of the satirist<lb/>
Were ringing with laughter and scold,<lb/>
And his eyes were aglow with the humor of souls<lb/>
Which whisper and ever remain.<lb/>
<lb/>
5. So Bell called together a smattering<lb/>
Of the remaining children of memory<lb/>
And used them to toy with the idea of Blake<lb/>
Hoping it not the same when he leaves it.<lb/>
<lb/>
6. And the kicks seemed to be worth the time.
