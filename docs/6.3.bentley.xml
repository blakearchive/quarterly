          <p>William Blake’s designs to John Bunyan’s <hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi> have always
been considerably less well-known than they deserve. Blake made the series during the last few years of his
life (the paper is watermarked 1824, when he was 67), and no contemporary reference to them is known.</p>
          <p>Blake had of course long known Bunyan before this. About 1794 he made a print of The Man Sweeping
The Interpreter’s Parlour from <hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi>, and in his last years his young
disciples referred to his flat as The House of the Interpreter. In a letter of 4 December 1804 Blake said, “I
shall travel on in the Strength of the Lord God as Poor Pilgrim says” in <hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s
Progress</hi>, and he associated himself directly with Bunyan when he commented that for “two so unequal
labourers” as Flaxman and himself to contribute designs for a publication of Hayley’s “would be (to say the
best of myself) like putting John Milton with John Bunyan.” In his <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> he compared his
genteel patron Hayley to Bunyan’s “Pick thank,” and, in his “Vision of the Last Judgment” (1810), he said
that “Pilgrim’s Progress is full” of vision.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n15"
type="note">1</ref> But he never referred to his Bunyan designs in writings which survive. <note id="n15">1
<hi rend="i">The Complete Writings of William Blake</hi>, ed. G. Keynes (1957), 549, 604.</note></p>
          <p>Indeed, nothing was publicly known of the designs until they appeared at an anonymous sale at
Sotheby’s on 29 April 1862, as lot 187:
<q><corr type="emend"><hi rend="smallcaps">A Series of Twenty-Eight Designs for the<lb/>
  Pilgrim’s Progress</hi>,</corr> <hi rend="i">nineteen of them highly finished in colours</hi></q>
                        when they were sold for £13.10<hi rend="i">s</hi> to [R. M.] Milnes. They were
described by W. M. Rossetti in the catalogue of Blake’s art which he prepared for Alexander Gilchrist’s
<hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> (1863), II, 235,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n16"
type="note">2</ref> but they were then forgotten by Blake scholars until Sir Geoffrey Keynes saw them about
1928 and later reproduced them in <hi rend="i">The Pilgrim’s Progress</hi> Illustrated with 29 watercolour
paintings by William Blake, ed. G. B. Harrison, Introduction by Geoffrey Keynes (New York, 1941). They were
exhibited at The Knoedler Gallery and at The Cleveland Museum in 1941<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n17" type="note">3</ref> and sold to The Frick Collection, where they have been stored in the vault
for most of the rest of the time since then. Aside from Keynes’ Introduction to his edition of 
<hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi> (reprinted in his <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi> [1949, 1971]) and reviews
of the Keynes edition and of the exhibitions, there has scarcely been a serious account of these important
designs. <note id="n16">2 The relationship between Rossetti’s alphabetical order, the pencil numbers, and

            Drawing No. 22 is cut down to the margins and pasted to a larger sheet which is watermarked 
<corr type="emend"><hi rend="smallcaps">J Whatman</hi></corr> / 1828.</p>
          <p>The numbers and inscriptions appear to be mostly in the same hand,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n27" type="note">13</ref> which is not Blake’s. He rarely spells “Judgement” with
two “e”s, as in No. 14, and he never uses the disagreeable spelling “Xtian” which appears in Nos. 5-7, 9-11.
The “F”, “g”, “h”, “H”, “I”, and “M” are significantly unlike his, and the uncertainty of numbering would be
difficult to reconcile with his authority. Most telling of all, the inscription on the mount of No. 22, which
is in the same hand as that on the other drawings, is on paper watermarked “1828”, the year after Blake’s
death. <note id="n27">13 “Pilgrim’s Progress” on No. 1, “Christian returning home” on No. 11, and perhaps
“Apollyon” at the top of No. 20 appear to me to be by Blake.</note></p>
          <p>Who, then, made the inscriptions? The most obvious candidate is, I believe, the correct one. At
Blake’s death in 1827, all his property evidently went to his widow Catherine. For a time, Catherine lived
with Blake’s devoted disciple Frederick Tatham, and, according to Tatham’s manuscript “Life of Blake,” at
her death in 1831 she “bequeathed . . . to him . . . all of his Works that remained unsold at his Death being
writings, paintings, and a very great number of Copper Plates”.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n28" type="note">14</ref> Much later Anne Gilchrist wrote: “Tatham came into possession of so large a
stock of Designs and engraved Books, that he has, by his own confession, been selling them ‘for thirty
years’ and at ‘good prices.’ ”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n29" type="note">15</ref>
Indeed, it is generally assumed that Tatham was the anonymous vendor at the 1862 sale in which the Bunyan
drawings first appeared publicly,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n30" type="note">16</ref>
and it is difficult to imagine who else at that time is likely to have had the enormous number of 182
miscellaneous Blake drawings to sell, not to mention works in Illuminated Printing. And if, as seems very
likely, Tatham acquired the Bunyan drawings from Mrs. Blake and sold them in 1862, it seems equally likely
that he numbered the drawings (with some difficulty) and identified them, between 1828 and 1863, when Rossetti
quoted No. 11. <note id="n28">14 <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> (1969), p. 533.</note>
	<note id="n29">15 <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> (1969), pp. 416-417. On the verso of No. 1 is “10/6”,
perhaps Tatham’s early price.</note>
	<note id="n30">16 <hi rend="i">The Blake Collection of W. Graham Robertson</hi>, ed. Kerrison Preston (1952),
pp. 39, 74, 114, 133, 136, 138, 140, 142, 167, 170, 173-74, 178. Keynes (<hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi>
[1971], pp. 166, 167) is unaware of the appearance of the Bunyan designs in the 1862 sale and suggests they
may have belonged to Butts.</note></p>
          <p>I have compared photographs of the Bunyan inscriptions with a photocopy of Tatham’s “Life of
Blake” (now in the possession of Mr. Paul Mellon) and conclude that the hands are very similar. In particular,
the “A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, “E”, “F”, “g”, “G”, “L”, “M”, and “T” are strikingly like Tatham’s and unlike
Blake’s, and some numbers (“7” and “24”) and words (“Faith”, “hopeful”, “heavenly”, “burden”) seem to me
unmistakably similar. The handwriting, then, seems to confirm Tatham’s ownership of the Bunyan drawings.</p>
          <p>Tatham’s authority as to Blake’s intentions may, of course, be good, but it is certainly not
infallible. He changed his mind about the order of Nos. 3-7, 14, 26, and he made a few mistakes in order which
he never corrected: No. 9 has no number at all, two designs are numbered “27”, and none is numbered “28”.
Further, one of the drawings he numbered with the Bunyan series (No. 22) is generally thought to belong
instead with Blake’s <hi rend="i">Paradise Regained</hi> drawings,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n31" type="note">17</ref> the rest of which belonged to John Linnell from October 1825<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n32" type="note">18</ref> until his posthumous sale in March 1918. We
may take Tatham’s inscriptions, then, as a useful but errant guide to Blake’s intentions in the 
<hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi> drawings. <note id="n31">17 Keynes, <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi> (1971),

          <p>A number of perplexing problems remain. There were <corr type="emend">“<hi
rend="smallcaps">twenty-eight Designs</hi>”</corr> in the series when Tatham sold it in 1862, but the series
now has twenty-nine drawings, the last evidently numbered “29” by Tatham; when did the twenty-ninth drawing
join the others, which one is it, and where did it come from? If No. 22 is part of the <hi rend="i">Paradise
Regained</hi> or another series, when and how did it join the Bunyan drawings? What is the correct order of
the drawings? What are the mysterious “Page” references Tatham gives on No. 13, 16, 18-20, 24, 29, none of
them higher than “50”? Can they refer to the particular edition of <hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi>
which Blake was using? If so, why are only early pages cited? Are there other Bunyan drawings, finished or
unfinished, which belong with the series<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n33"
type="note">19</ref> and which might help to account for Tatham’s uncertainties? How reliably do Tatham’s
inscriptions identify Blake’s drawings, and was he using more than the internal evidence available to us?
Such questions should, I think, exercise anyone who embarks on the serious study of Blake’s illustrations to
<hi rend="i">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi> which is now overdue.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
