          <p>Bo Ossian Lindberg recently suggested in his review of Robert N. Essick’s <hi rend="i">William
Blake Printmaker</hi> that “Blake scholars should cite Tambroni,” in the 1821 edition, when the topic is
William Blake’s awareness of <hi rend="i">Il Libro dell’Arte</hi> or <hi rend="i">The Craftsman’s
Handbook</hi> by Cennino Cennini.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n47" type="note">1</ref>
Lindberg’s advice continues the discussion of a minor but unresolved problem in Blake scholarship regarding
the sources and nature of Blake’s ideas about artistic material and techniques of painting.<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n48" type="note">2</ref> Under discussion here are Blake’s so-called
“Fresco Pictures,” fresco being the name with which Blake himself in 1809 described his pictures made with
watercolor on a kind of plaster ground: “The Art has been lost: I have recovered it.”<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n49" type="note">3</ref> Blake is silent about his tempering agent and
ground for the fresco technique, but J.T. Smith, a long time friend, wrote in 1828 that Blake tempered his
pigments with “glue-water” made from “carpenter’s glue” and used the same material in his
ground.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n50" type="note">4</ref> In 1862, John Linnell wrote
to the wife of Blake’s biographer, Alexander Gilchrist, that he gave Blake a copy of Cennino’s book: “I
believe that the first copy of Cennino Cennini seen in England was the copy I obtained from Italy &amp; gave
to Blake who soon made it out &amp; was gratified to find that he had been using the same materials &amp;
methods as Cennini describes—particularly the Carpenters glue.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref

          <p>In this note I would like to explore the “Cennino connection.” As of now Essick and Lindberg
follow Linnell’s account that Blake was first aware of this primary source for Trecento painting material
and techniques only in 1821, and that earlier he had adopted traditional methods from recipe books.
Cennino’s writings were available earlier, however. A copy of his lost holograph had entered the Medici
Grand Duke’s collection and by 1681 the location in Florence had been published: this little known
manuscript was also discussed in at least three other books of 1739, 1759 and 1778 as a valuable curiosity
full of ancient secrets which should be brought to light.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n52"
type="note">6</ref> More important, George Cumberland, Blake’s close friend, knew of this manuscript and
said that the Medici Grand Duke loaned it to him “for some days.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n53" type="note">7</ref> I suggest that it is highly probable that Blake was aware of some of the
directions for the painting of frescoes from Cennino some twenty-five years before the published edition
through the agency of Cumberland.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n54" type="note">8</ref>
	<note id="n52"><hi rend="s">6</hi> Although Vasari (see n. 13 below) first mentions Cennino, the location in
the Laurentian Library in Florence seems to be published first by [Filippo Baldinucci], <hi rend="i">Notizie
dei professori del disegno da Cimabue</hi> . . . , ed. Fernando Ranalli (Florence: V. Batelli &amp; Co.,
1845), p. 312. My thanks to Dr. Lindberg for pointing out the Baldinucci reference to me. I derive the
following account of the manuscript from Thompson, <hi rend="i">Il Libro</hi>, I, ix-xii. Three manuscript
copies of Cennino’s lost original written after 1396 are known. The two earliest recensions upon which
Thompson relies are the Quattrocento MS in the Laurentian Library, 78.P.23, finished by 1437, and the
Cinquecento MS in the Riccardian Library, 2190, not mentioned until 1810. The third is an eighteenth century
copy of the Laurentian MS, the Vatican Ottobonian 2914, dated 1737, which is the one upon which Tambroni’s
edition is based. The Laurentian Library MS was examined and mentioned by Bernard de Montfauçon, 
<hi rend="i">Bibliotheca Bibliothecarum nova</hi> (Paris: 1739), I, 395C, and was included in A. M. Bandini, 
<hi rend="i">Catalogus codicum italicorum bibliothecae mediceae laurentianae</hi> . . . (Florence: 1778), V, 307.
An allusion to “L’opera del Cennini nato in Valdelsa si ritrova nella libreria Medicea di S. Lorenzo al
banco 78 cod. 24” is contained in the 1759 Bottari edition of Vasari’s <hi rend="i">Le Vite</hi>, I, 21,
as cited in Barrocchi, <hi rend="i">Le Vite</hi>, II, 638 (see n. 13 below).</note>

Sculpture, and the System that guided the ancient artists in composing their figures and groupes</hi> (London,
1796), p. 27.</note>
	<note id="n54"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Blake and Cumberland were also exploring solutions to the problem of
making plates for printing their own works as early as 1784-85, and may also have shared information at that
time (Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, p. 32; Bindman, <hi rend="i">Artist</hi>, pp.
42-43).</note></p>
          <p>Cumberland was on the Continent, principally in Italy, between 1785 and 1790.<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n55" type="note">9</ref> He mentioned “<hi rend="i">Andrea Cennini de
Colle di Valdessa</hi>” and the manuscript in his 1796 <hi rend="i">Thoughts on Outline</hi> where he wrote
that the “manuscript is very valuable, on account of the exact directions which it gives for the painting in
fresco of those times.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n56" type="note">10</ref> By 1794
Blake had begun engraving plates for <hi rend="i">Thoughts on Outline</hi>, and he offered Cumberland
technical advice for his own efforts at engraving, as attested by an affectionate letter which
survives.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n57" type="note">11</ref> Blake began to use
experimental media and techniques for printing and painting on paper about 1795, and his biblical paintings on

          <p>In the eighteenth century there were few specific references to the content of Cennino’s
manuscript. It was first mentioned by Giorgio Vasari in <hi rend="i">Le Vite</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Lives of
the Italian Painters</hi>, in 1568, and Filippo Baldinucci in 1681 referred to its location in the Laurentian
Library in Florence.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n59" type="note">13</ref> Cumberland’s
actual references to Cennino’s manuscript in <hi rend="i">Thoughts on Outline</hi> go beyond information
which was available in Vasari’s <hi rend="i">Le Vite</hi>, which he owned, or in Baldinucci.<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n60" type="note">14</ref> From <hi rend="i">Le Vite</hi>, which was
well known in the second Italian edition or in two subsequent editions, anyone could learn in the “Vita
d’Agnolo Gaddi” that “Cennino di Drea Cennini da Colle di Valdelsa . . . scrisse in un libro di sua mano
i modi del lavorarre a fresco, a tempera, a colla ed a gomma . . . .Tratto . . . del macinare i colori a olio

details about <hi rend="i">how</hi> to work in fresco, tempera, glue and gum or how to mix colors in oil, but
he did establish beyond doubt that Cennino was a pupil of Agnolo whose father in turn learned directly from
the early Trecento painter Giotto. <note id="n59"><hi rend="s">13</hi> For Vasari I rely on [Giorgio Vasari],
<hi rend="i">Le vite de’ più eccelenti pittori scultori e architettori nelle redazione del 1550 e

          <p>In <hi rend="i">Thoughts on Outline</hi> we find evidence to indicate that Cumberland read part
of the manuscript. He refers in the same order as Cennino does to technical points raised in Chapters 5, 6 and
7 of <hi rend="i">Il Libro</hi>, and compresses them in a single sentence: “I found, that the venerable
author of this treatise, states, that in his time, the Artists used to draw on a smooth piece of fig-tree, and
also on parchment, which had been powdered with calcined bone, and with a fine silver style, in order to
attain the justest Outline possible.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n62"
type="note">16</ref> Thompson translates these instructions for learning to draw as “you begin with drawing
on a panel of wood . . . For that purpose, a little panel of fig wood is good.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n63" type="note">17</ref> The panel is prepared for drawing by spreading ground bones
mixed with saliva on the smoothed wood. Old bone from the second joints and wings of fowl are good, says
Cennino: “Just as you find them under the dining-table, put them in the fire
<pb id="p17-146" n="146"/>
. . . .” Cumberland omitted the matter-of-fact reference to the source of the bones and he elevated the
process for which Cennino used the word <hi rend="i">chotto</hi> or baking by using the more scientific term
calcination. Cennino then recommends using a style of silver. The leisurely narrative chapters of Cennino are
succinctly summarized by Cumberland as he presses his main point about the quality of outline.

quotations in this paragraph.</note></p>
          <p>I propose that Cumberland could and would have been interested in reading the entire manuscript.
In the Laurentian manuscript a glossator had written headings for short chapters, making it easy to find out
the general contents.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n64" type="note">18</ref> The manuscript
copy itself, which Cumberland said he had for some days, is written in an archaic form of Italian with
expressions from the Paduan dialect,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n65" type="note">19</ref>
which is not difficult to read. In a reproduction of folio I<hi rend="s">r</hi> (illus. 1) it is easy to see
in the last eight lines <hi rend="i">dipignere, fantasia, hoperazione di mano, sotto ombra, naturale,
fermarle</hi>, in a passage in which Cennino describes himself as pursuing “an occupation known as 
<hi rend="i">painting</hi>, which calls for <hi rend="i">imagination</hi>, and <hi rend="i">skill of hand</hi>, in
order to discover things not seen, hiding themselves <hi rend="i">under the shadow</hi> of 
<hi rend="i">natural</hi> objects, and to <hi rend="i">give them shape</hi> with the hand, presenting to plain
sight what does not actually exist.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n66"
type="note">20</ref> Cumberland’s motivation for perusing the manuscript—his curiosity about the art of
the Greeks and the Romans, his avid pursuit of old prints, antique gems and ancient artifacts, and his
interest in learning details about craft techniques—is easily documented.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n67" type="note">21</ref> However, unless his untraced manuscripts made during his
Italian travels turn up, we cannot know exactly the extent or nature of any notes he may have taken.<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n68" type="note">22</ref> The paragraph in <hi rend="i">Thoughts on
Outline</hi> is our clue that he saw, read and later referred accurately to information learned from the copy
of Cennino’s valuable early manuscript. However, we should be aware, as Thompson cautions, that there are
many ambiguities in the manuscript,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n69" type="note">23</ref>
and these may have influenced Cumberland’s understanding and transmission of information.

          <p>Because Blake did experiment with painting in a variety of media in the second half of the 1790s,
naming them fresco pictures, it is likely that he was acting on the “exact directions,” accurate or not,
which Cumberland brought back from Florence. Of course, interest in reviving ancient practices was high in the
second half of the eighteenth century, and antiquarians, craftsmen and artists consulted many sources for
information.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n70" type="note">24</ref> The use of a variety of
materials, including plaster or whiting grounds and glues derived from animal skin, was widespread in
England.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n71" type="note">25</ref> Exactly what Blake’s
media were is not yet known, and will not be until chemical analyses are available.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n72" type="note">26</ref> Martin Butlin may be acknowledging this reality when he
calls “Blake’s own changing formula” which he used from about 1795 into the 1820s by the inclusive term
of “tempera.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n73" type="note">27</ref> The exact
directions for painting in fresco to which Cumberland had access include those for painting in true fresco, in
which pigments suspended or dissolved only in water are painted directly on wet plaster, or gesso, and to
painting on dry gesso panels with pigment tempered either with gum, glue or egg.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n74" type="note">28</ref>
	<note id="n70"><hi rend="s">24</hi> The most recent treatment of a phase of this revival of interest in
ancient practices that I know of is the fascinating unpublished Ph.D. dissertation of Danielle Rice, “The
Fire of the Ancients: The Encaustic Painting Revival, 1755-1812,” Yale University, 1979. Rice’s work
provides a detailed description of the international nature of these explorations of early manuscripts for
techniques and the interest in technical matters and shared experimental results in the second half of the
eighteenth century.</note>
	<note id="n71"><hi rend="s">25</hi> Rice points out that experiments and interest in encaustic painting
peaked in England in the 1760s, and she mentions many variations in the process of wall painting (Chapters 4
and 5, especially pp. 196 and 201).</note>
	<note id="n72"><hi rend="s">26</hi> Lindberg refers to such chemical analysis of an Essick colorprint in his
review of Essick’s book. His talk in Toronto, February 1983, on “The Chariot of Genius: Blake’s Binders
and Pigments” (which is in the future at the time of this writing) may address this problem.</note>

          <p>On the basis of Smith’s 1828 account that Blake’s methods involved the use of
“carpenter’s glue,” a practice of the earliest fresco painters, and of Linnell’s letter to Mrs.
Gilchrist, Blake’s formula has been connected with Cennino’s glue called <hi rend="i">colla di
spichi.</hi> Essick noted that W.M. Rossetti cited the specific reference to Cennino in 1863.<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n75" type="note">29</ref> Cennino in several chapters mentions a glue
made from parts of goats, <hi rend="i">colla di spichi</hi>, or leaf glue.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n76" type="note">30</ref> As Lindberg points out, he gives very precise directions for
making it in Chapter 109.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n77" type="note">31</ref> “And
there is a glue which is known as leaf glue; this is made out of clippings of goats’ muzzles, feet, sinews,
and many clippings of skins . . . And it is a good glue for wood . . . it may be used for . . . gessos, for
tempering colors . . . fastening pieces of wood . . . tempering gessos.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n78" type="note">32</ref> In Chapters 16 to 22, Cennino gives all the instructions for
grinding colors on a porphyry slab, tempering them with the glue purchased at the apothecary, and tinting
parchment or paper. A close reading of Cennino’s entire book shows that the glue which can be purchased at
the apothecary is the same as leaf glue, <hi rend="i">colla di spichi</hi>, which is also given the name of
goat’s glue.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n79" type="note">33</ref> This is the glue to
which Rossetti referred in Chapter 19. But it was easier for Rossetti, as it is for us, to understand and
study instructions in a printed edition. <note id="n75"><hi rend="s">29</hi> Essick,

glue.”</note></p>
          <p>Linnell’s report in 1862 (quoted above) that he gave the 1821 edition to Blake has influenced
thinking about the artist and his painting techniques.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n80"
type="note">34</ref> Essick proposed that Blake would have found in Tambroni’s edition of Cennino
“evidence that his own method of using woodworking glue as a fixative had been used by the Italian
Renaissance masters he so much admired.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n81"
type="note">35</ref> Butlin dates Blake’s later paintings, in which his technique “consists of a much
thinner paint film, akin to water colour, on a gesso ground laid on paper or panel” to about 1821,<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n82" type="note">36</ref> perhaps also thinking of the availability of
Cennino’s instructions. In his review of Butlin’s book, Essick in fact suggests that Blake’s reading of
Cennino’s book perhaps caused him “to alter his practice slightly.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n83" type="note">37</ref> Indeed, the change itself may well be one of the strongest
pieces of evidence that Blake did see the detailed instructions in Tambroni’s edition, which, in spite of
its omissions and inaccuracies, would have provided information which could be considered carefully. 
<note id="n80"><hi rend="s">34</hi> Aside from the problem about when Blake learned Italian (see Bentley, 
<hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, pp. 349-50, 475), another minor problem is connected with this claim. In January
of 1838, Linnell wrote to his son-in-law, Samuel Palmer, in Italy, “quoting Cennino Cennini’s 
<hi rend="i">Il Libro dell’Arte</hi>, which he had seen at Callcott’s” (as cited in Edward Malins, 
<hi rend="i">Samuel Palmer’s Italian Honeymoon</hi> [London: Oxford University Press, 1968], p. 88.) Malins had
access to the Ivimy MSS, the Linnell family papers. I raise the question of why Linnell would have mentioned
Cennino’s book to Palmer as though he had seen it for the first time at the Kensington home of his neighbor,
Sir Augustus Callcott, if he indeed had the first copy in England and gave it to Blake.
                            <p>Also contributing to the idea that Blake saw the Tambroni edition are two
artifacts mentioned by E.J. Ellis and Geoffrey Keynes, which however cannot be traced. E.J. Ellis, in 
<hi rend="i">The Real Blake</hi>, 1907, p. 420, first mentioned a sentence by Blake in the “Linnell” copy of
Cennino, as noted by Geoffrey Keynes in <hi rend="i">A Bibliography of William Blake</hi> (New York: Grolier
Club of New York, 1921), pp. 53-54. For references to this artifact see David V. Erdman, <hi rend="i">The
Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi> (Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1965), pp. 659,
803, and also see Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, pp. 684-85. Erdman and Bentley both cast doubt on
Ellis’s reliability and accuracy. Keynes, in <hi rend="i">A Bibliography</hi>, p. 53, also describes as an
eyewitness an extract from Cennino’s work in Blake’s hand in a sketchbook belonging to George Richmond
sold at Sotheby’s on 28 July 1920. For other references see Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, pp.
684-85, Butlin, <hi rend="i">Drawings</hi>, p. 548, and Essick, review of Butlin, p. 60.</p></note>
	<note id="n81"><hi rend="s">35</hi> Essick, <hi rend="i">Printmaker</hi>, p. 123. Cennino’s manuscript
deals with Trecento practices, not those of the Cinquecento, as one might infer from Essick’s use of the
word Renaissance.</note>

          <p>However, the credit for being the first to bring information from Cennino’s “very old
treatise on painting” to Blake’s attention should go, I propose, to George

Cumberland, his long time friend and fellow searcher for knowledge about the lost art of the ancients. Blake
defended the right to paint from the imagination, he valued a skilled execution and a just outline. These
beliefs and values were extraordinarily like those of Cennino, who also pursued that demanding profession of
painting which called for <hi rend="i">fantasia e hoperazione di mano.</hi></p>
