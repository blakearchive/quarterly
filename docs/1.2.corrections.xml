                <p>The Gnomes were at work in issue number 1, and the following errors and omissions should be
noted:</p>
                <p>The report on the <corr type="emend">Blake-Varley</corr> sketchbook (p. 2) appeared not in
<hi rend="u">TLS</hi> but in the London <hi rend="u">Times.</hi> We thank Mr. Martin Butlin for pointing this
out and Miss Mary Hanna for having sent us the clipping.</p>
                <p>Mr. Fred <corr type="emend">Whitehead,</corr> whom we again thank for a list of ongoing
Blake projects, was incorrectly renamed Robert.</p>
                <p>Our masthead was <corr type="emend">designed</corr> by Miss Amy Tsuji, who also compiled
the list of articles on pp. 2-4 of number 1. On page 3, we should have included the contributions by Fred C.
Robinson to the December 1966 <hi rend="u">PMLA</hi> discussion “Tense and the Sense of Blake’s ‘The
Tyger’” (599-600, 602-603).</p>
                <p>On p. 7 (Stevenson note 3), there were two obvious typos for “Keynes” and “Greek.”</p>
                <p>All of which reminds us that the crooked roads without Improvement are roads of Genius.</p>
