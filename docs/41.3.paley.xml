          </head>

          <p>As is well known, William Blake exhibited three pictures at the Royal Academy exhibition of 1808.
These are listed in the exhibition catalogue as “311 Jacob’s dream,—vide Genesis, chap. xxviii, ver.
12”; “439 Christ in the sepulcher, guarded by angels”; and “477 The Last Judgment.”<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n8" type="note">1</ref> There is a peculiarity about the listing of the
third that has been silently corrected in Blake scholarship. It seems indeed trivial, involving only one
letter. The artist’s name is given as “B. Blake.” <note id="n8">1. <hi rend="i">The Exhibition of the
Royal Academy MDCCCVIII.</hi></note></p>
          <p>Royal Academy catalogues were probably produced quickly and with little proofreading. Getting a
letter wrong was nothing out of the ordinary. The miniature painter John Hazlitt’s name was, for example,
given as “T. Hazlitt” in the catalogue of 1802 in conjunction with Hazlitt’s portrait of Samuel Taylor
Coleridge.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n9" type="note">2</ref> However, there is an
important difference here. There was in 1802 no exhibiting painter named T. Hazlitt, while John Hazlitt had
exhibited every year from 1788 through 1801. The public could easily guess the real name of the artist who
showed the Coleridge portrait and three others. In contrast, Benjamin Blake was the name of a painter of
landscapes and of game who exhibited “View at Dumford, near Amesbury” (171) in 1808, and whose address is
given in the catalogue as 37 Broad Street, Soho.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n10"
type="note">3</ref> (William Blake’s address is correctly given as 17 South Molton Street, Oxford Street.)
As the Royal Academy did not act as an agent for selling paintings, providing the artist’s address was a way
for prospective buyers to gain contact, and so giving the wrong artist’s name for <hi rend="i">The Last
Judgment</hi> was, though unintentional, a professional disservice. It is also an indication of how obscure
Blake was as he entered what Alexander Gilchrist was to call his “Years of Deepening Neglect.” 
<note id="n9">2. See my <hi rend="i">Portraits of Coleridge</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1999) 28.</note>
	<note id="n10">3. Some details about B. Blake, but not the confusion about <hi rend="i">The Last
Judgment</hi>, are given in appendix 2, “Blake Residences,” in G. E. Bentley, Jr.’s <hi rend="i">Blake
Records</hi>, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale UP, 2004) 737. By 1811, when B. Blake showed “View at Great Dunford,
Wiltshire” (<hi rend="i">The Exhibition of the Royal Academy MDCCCXI</hi>, 146), his address was Great
Dunford, near Salisbury.</note></p>
