      <td class="body">William and Catherine Blake returned to London in
 September 1803, after spending three years in the seaside village of 
Felpham in Sussex. During the two years that followed, one of William’s 
most important and time-consuming occupations was assisting William 
Hayley with the illustrations to be engraved for Hayley’s <em>Life of George Romney</em>.
 Blake had commissions for two of these and hoped for more. These 
activities were no mere task for Blake, who praised the gifts of “our 
admired Sublime Romney”&nbsp;<a href="#fn1" name="fr1" id="fr1">[1]</a> 
and thought, unfairly, that Romney’s talent had been diverted from 
history to portrait painting by Hayley, asserting in a frank letter to 
his brother James that Hayley “thinks to turn me into a Portrait Painter
 as he did Poor Romney” (30 January 1803, E 725). In the extraordinary 
letter that Blake wrote to Hayley about his renewal of vision “on the 
day after visiting the Truchsessian Gallery of pictures,” he stated: “I 
can, with confidence, promise you ocular demonstration of my altered 
state on the plates I am now engraving after Romney, whose spiritual aid
 has not a little conduced to my restoration to the light of Art.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn2" name="fr2" id="fr2">[2]</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">2</td>
      <td class="body">Blake’s esteem for Romney was no doubt 
intensified by the facts that he had known the older artist in the 1790s
 and that there had been strong bonds between both their political 
beliefs and their art at that time. True, Romney was not an easy man to 
know. His friend Richard Cumberland characterized him as “shy, private, 
studious and contemplative; conscious of all the disadvantages and 
privations of a very stinted education; of a habit naturally 
hypochondriac, with aspen nerves, that every breath could ruffle.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn3" name="fr3" id="fr3">[3]</a>
 He had some very close friends, but it is significant that, as his old 
friend Thomas Greene observed, “he seemed always to avoid associating 
with Gentlemen of his Profession.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn4" name="fr4" id="fr4">[4]</a>
 The exceptions were three artists in fields far from his own: the 
sculptor John Flaxman and the miniaturists Jeremiah Meyer and (for a 
time) Ozias Humphry.&nbsp;<a href="#fn5" name="fr5" id="fr5">[5]</a> 
After 1772, when Romney showed a portrait of Humphry at the Society of 
Artists, he did not participate in any further annual exhibitions, and 
he never showed his work at the Royal Academy. None of these factors, 
however, would have precluded friendship with Blake, who, like Romney, 
was not a university man, was self-educated, and came from a 
middle-class family.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">3</td>
      <td class="body">That Romney admired Blake’s work as early as 1784
 is shown by his telling Flaxman that Blake’s historical drawings “rank 
with those of M<sup>l</sup>. Angelo.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn6" name="fr6" id="fr6">[6]</a>
 Romney did not confine his regard to words, but paid Blake an artist’s 
ultimate compliment: as Joseph Viscomi has shown in a seminal article, 
in the 1790s Romney was the original purchaser of four of Blake’s 
illuminated books: <em>America </em>copy A,<em> The </em>[<em>First</em>] <em>Book of Urizen </em>copy<em> </em>B, <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> copy F, and <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience </em>copy<em> </em>A.&nbsp;<a href="#fn7" name="fr7" id="fr7">[7]</a>
 It is unlikely that Romney could have admired Blake’s drawings and 
purchased his illuminated books without ever seeing Blake himself, but 
further proof that they conversed is Blake’s later statement that “In 
this [“Canterbury Pilgrims”] Plate M<sup>r</sup> B has resumed the style
 with which he set out in life of which Heath &amp; Stothard were the 
awkward imitators at that time it is the style of Alb Durers Histries 
&amp; the old Engravers which cannot be imitated by any one who does not
 understand Drawing &amp; which according to Heath &amp; Stothard 
Flaxman &amp; even Romney. Spoils an Engraver <em>for Each of these Men have repeatedly asserted this Absurdity to me</em>
 [emphasis mine] in condemnation of my Work” (“Public Address,” E 572). 
In this context Blake, at a difficult point in his life, angrily 
condemns his fellow artists in a verbal shotgun blast that confounds 
friend and foe alike. “Even Romney,” however, suggests that of all 
people Romney should have known better. (Romney may perhaps with the 
best intentions have urged an artist whose drawings ranked with 
Michelangelo’s to pursue painting rather than engraving.)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">4</td>
      <td class="body">These facts give some credibility to an 
interesting but otherwise undocumented account concerning the two 
artists. Richard C. Jackson, who claimed that his father had known 
Blake, asserted that Romney had presented Blake with a vine and a fig 
tree from his own garden. “My father,” Jackson wrote, “told me that the 
dear Blake, while resident at Hercules Buildings, Lambeth, that he 
should say the one joyaunce of Blake’s life was when he had a garden of 
his own and could bask in the sunshine ’neath his own vine—a vine which 
had been presented to him by the artist Romney (he died on the 15<sup>th</sup> November, 1802 even as his other friend, Ozias Humphries [<em>sic</em>],
 R.A., died eight years later). This vine, I was given to understand, 
was grafted from the great vine at Versailles or Fontainbleau.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn8" name="fr8" id="fr8">[8]</a> Jackson is a frequently unreliable narrator,&nbsp;<a href="#fn9" name="fr9" id="fr9">[9]</a>
 and his account can be only supplementary to the hard evidence about 
Romney’s relationship with Blake. However, a few aspects of his 
statement lend it support, some by omission. Romney had indeed visited 
Versailles, in 1764, in the company of the great painter of seascapes 
Claude-Joseph Vernet,&nbsp;<a href="#fn10" name="fr10" id="fr10">[10]</a>
 although there is no mention of his taking a cutting from a grapevine 
there. Jackson introduces Humphry, whose name he misspells, because he 
was “his [Blake’s] other friend.” Blake had considerably more than two 
friends, but Humphry is no doubt linked with him here because he too 
purchased works by Blake in the mid-1790s.&nbsp;<a href="#fn11" name="fr11" id="fr11">[11]</a>
 Whatever its ultimate origin, Jackson supposes that the vine came from 
“some place in the country which Romney had, and had given up at or 
about the time of Blake becoming resident at Lambeth.” His guess is half
 right. The “place in the country” would have been Pine Apple Place in 
Kilburn, “in a new garden ground,” as Romney wrote to Hayley in June 
1793, “where I work two hours in advancing my designs (for my series of 
large pictures).”&nbsp;<a href="#fn12" name="fr12" id="fr12">[12]</a> 
Romney had not vacated it but had, rather, just rented it, and a vine, 
as Jackson says, “might have come from Romney’s country home.” Jackson 
is hard put to account for how a vine under which Blake could sit could 
have grown to that size in so short a time, but that is because he 
assumes there could be only one vine in Blake’s garden. Alexander 
Gilchrist had written of the “fine vine” that “Blake would on no account
 prune”;&nbsp;<a href="#fn13" name="fr13" id="fr13">[13]</a> Jackson 
pictures Blake as “rejoicing … not only to sit beneath its shade, but 
beneath his own fig tree also—both vine and fig tree coming from 
Romney’s garden.” Again, it is less likely that this fig tree had an 
abnormal growth rate than that Romney gave Blake a cutting. (Gilchrist, 
however, says nothing about a fig tree.) Furthermore, the fact that 
Jackson seems unaware of the political symbolism of Romney’s gift may 
again suggest that there is some truth behind the story.&nbsp;<a href="#fn14" name="fr14" id="fr14">[14]</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">5</td>
      <td class="body">The fruits of the earth furnished abundant 
imagery to advocates of revolution in the late eighteenth century, not 
least to Blake, as near the end of <em>America</em>, where, after the 
victory of fiery Orc, the females “feel the nerves of youth renew, and 
desires of ancient times, / Over their pale limbs as a vine when the 
tender grape appears” (15.25-26, E 57). The yoking of vine and fig tree 
is especially important, signifying the peace and freedom of a 
millennial society. Its source is of course the Old Testament, as in 
Micah 4.4: “But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his 
fig tree; and none shall make [them] afraid: for the mouth of the LORD 
of hosts hath spoken [it].”&nbsp;<a href="#fn15" name="fr15" id="fr15">[15]</a>
 Such biblical texts became part of millennialist and pro-revolutionary 
discourse even before the American and French Revolutions. As early as 
1769, the novelist Henry Brooke speculated how, under the reign of 
Liberty, “would industry be encouraged to plant and multiply the vine 
and the fig-tree! how would benignity rejoice to call neighbours and 
strangers to come and fearlessly partake of the fruits thereof!”&nbsp;<a href="#fn16" name="fr16" id="fr16">[16]</a>
 George Washington wrote to the congregation of the Newport, Rhode 
Island, synagogue that in the new republic, “every one shall sit in 
safety under his own vine and figtree, and there shall be none to make 
him afraid.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn17" name="fr17" id="fr17">[17]</a> 
Appropriating the figure for his own purposes, Napoleon told his army of
 Italy in 1796: “When France gives peace to the world … each of you at 
his own hearthstone, under his own vine and fig tree, will be enjoying 
the prosperity won by your valor ….”&nbsp;<a href="#fn18" name="fr18" id="fr18">[18]</a> Conversely, in the fallen world that Blake describes in <em>Jerusalem</em>, members of the community can no longer meet “beneath the Vine and Fig-tree” (18.19, E 163).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">6</td>
      <td class="body">Romney and Hayley visited France as admirers of 
the revolution in 1790, and Hayley wrote of that time in language that 
may remind us of the famous passage beginning “O pleasant exercise of 
hope and joy!” in Wordsworth’s <em>Prelude </em>: “It was a time when 
that scene of astonishing vicissitudes presented to the friends of 
peace, of freedom, and of the arts, a spectacle of chearful curiosity, 
and of hope so magnificent in promises of good to mankind, that 
philanthropy could not fail to exult in the recent prospect, unconscious
 that the splendid vision was destined to sink in the most execrable 
horrors of barbarity and blood.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn19" name="fr19" id="fr19">[19]</a>
 Romney too felt great enthusiasm for the early republic but was 
appalled by the September Massacres, writing to Hayley on 8 September 
1792: “The accounts to day from France are dreadful: all the priests 
that were confined are murdered, perhaps the city of Paris is at this 
time in flames. I am so agitated with the tremendous situation of that 
poor Country, I am not able to do any thing.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn20" name="fr20" id="fr20">[20]</a>
 Nevertheless, Romney retained his radical sympathies at home, as was 
well known to his friends, and to some extent to the public as 
well.&nbsp;<a href="#fn21" name="fr21" id="fr21">[21]</a> He was a 
friend of Thomas Paine, who sometimes lay low at Romney’s house, and who
 was indicted for sedition on 21 May 1792.&nbsp;<a href="#fn22" name="fr22" id="fr22">[22]</a> A few weeks after that the <em>Morning Chronicle</em>
 reported that Romney was painting Paine’s portrait, “but whether for an
 individual likeness or as the hero of Paradise Lost is not stated. 
Those, however, who have seen the sketch say it’s ‘devilish 
like.’”&nbsp;<a href="#fn23" name="fr23" id="fr23">[23]</a> (It appears that the <em>Chronicle,</em> like Blake in <em>The Marriage of Heaven and</em> <em>Hell</em>, regarded Satan as the hero<em> </em>of <em>Paradise Lost</em>,<em> </em>although for different reasons.) In 1793 this painting (now untraced) was reproduced in a fine engraving by William Sharp (<a href="45.2.paleypaine" target="_blank">illus. 1</a>), showing a smiling Paine beside the manuscript of <em>Rights of Man</em>.&nbsp;<a href="#fn24" name="fr24" id="fr24">[24]</a> For his part, Blake names Paine four times among the defenders of freedom in <em>America</em>,
 published in the same year as Sharp’s engraving, and was to defend him 
vehemently in marginalia written some five years later.&nbsp;<a href="#fn25" name="fr25" id="fr25">[25]</a> Whether or not Blake walked the streets of London wearing the red cap of Liberty,&nbsp;<a href="#fn26" name="fr26" id="fr26">[26]</a> he gave expression to his revolutionary sympathies in the figure of Orc, who defeats the British army in <em>America</em>, and then appears “in the vineyards of red France” in <em>Europe</em>
 (1794; 15.2, E 66). Both Romney and Blake would have been conscious 
that the gift of vine and fig tree was a symbolic act, affirming their 
common adherence to a great popular cause.

      <td class="body">Aside from their politics, it may at first 
surprise us that Blake had such respect for Romney’s art. Romney was of 
course one of the leading portrait artists of his time. Many of his 
paintings have true elegance and grace, and sometimes, as Alex Kidson 
says of <em>The Leigh Family</em> (1768, National Gallery of Victoria), “an almost disturbing intensity of vision.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn27" name="fr27" id="fr27">[27]</a>
 His success, both artistic and financial, was enormous. Nevertheless, 
Romney was strongly attracted to another kind of art. In February 1787 
he wrote to Hayley: “This cursed portrait-painting! How I am shackled 
with it! I am determined to live frugally, that I may enable myself to 
cut it short, as soon as I am tolerably independent, and then give my 
mind up to those delightful regions of imagination.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn28" name="fr28" id="fr28">[28]</a>
 By that closing phrase, which has become famous in Romney studies, he 
meant what was in his time called “history painting”—a term that could 
include, in addition to strictly historical subjects, scenes from 
Milton, the Bible, Shakespeare, and mythology. Indeed, he had visited 
those regions from the beginning of his career, as in <em>Lear in the Tempest Tearing Off His Robes</em>
 (c. 1761, Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Kendal). Although Romney was a 
dedicated and highly successful portrait artist, having received 593 
sittings in 1783 alone,&nbsp;<a href="#fn29" name="fr29" id="fr29">[29]</a>
 he was nevertheless conflicted about his artistic vocation. Money alone
 was not the reason, although it certainly was a factor. In 1795 the 
diarist Joseph Farington wrote that Romney was reportedly worth the very
 considerable sum of £50,000.&nbsp;<a href="#fn30" name="fr30" id="fr30">[30]</a>
 He would have earned this almost entirely through portraiture, for it 
was notoriously difficult to sell history paintings. Romney knew himself
 to be a great portrait artist, and he was a perfectionist, said seldom 
to allow any other hand to touch his work at a time when it was common 
for artists to employ specialists in landscape backgrounds or draperies.
 He would rather lose an important commission, as he did Mrs. Siddons’s,
 than finish a picture in haste.&nbsp;<a href="#fn31" name="fr31" id="fr31">[31]</a> When Blake accused Hayley of turning Romney into a portrait painter, he was simplifying a complex situation.</td>

      <td class="body">What would have been most important to Blake 
about Romney’s art? Flaxman, who contributed a “Sketch of Romney’s 
Professional Character” to Hayley’s <em>Life</em>, points the direction.
 “His cartoons,” Flaxman wrote, “some of which have unfortunately 
perished, were examples of the sublime and terrible, at that time 
perfectly new in English art. The dream of Atossa, from the Persians of 
Æschylus, contrasted the death-like sleep of the Queen, with the 
Bacchanalian Fury of the Genius of Greece. The composition was conducted
 with the fire and severity of a Greek bas-relief: the ghost of Darius, 
with the Persians prostrated before him, awed the spectator by grandeur 
and mystery” (<a href="45.2.paleydarius" target="_blank">illus. 2</a>).&nbsp;<a href="#fn32" name="fr32" id="fr32">[32]</a>
 The picture Flaxman mentions is one of a group of large, finished 
drawings in black chalk or graphite, begun by Romney not long after his 
return from Italy in 1775 and continued over a period of perhaps a 
decade.&nbsp;<a href="#fn33" name="fr33" id="fr33">[33]</a> “His 
compositions,” Flaxman continued, “like those of the ancient pictures, 
and basso relievos, told their story by a single group of figures in the
 front, whilst the back ground is made the simplest possible, rejecting 
all unnecessary episode, and trivial ornament, either of secondary 
groups or architectural subdivision.” These were also Blake’s artistic 
concerns early in his career (and at times afterwards), and Blake also 
shared with Romney, Flaxman, and others both a strongly neoclassical 
style and techniques of pen and wash draftsmanship. As Jean H. Hagstrum,
 one of the few to have taken up this subject, argues, “a linear and 
thematic stamp from Romney is visible on Blake’s works from the early <em>Tiriel </em>to the<em> </em>very late Dante illustrations.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn34" name="fr34" id="fr34">[34]</a><div class="illus"><img src="311.jpg" alt="The Ghost of Darius Appearing to Atossa" height="158" width="200"><div>2.

      <td class="body">At the time that Blake began looking for Romney 
pictures to be engraved, the state of Romney’s oeuvre was almost 
chaotic. Even while the artist was alive, some of it had been subjected 
to terrible treatment in Romney’s move to Hampstead on Christmas 1798. 
In the words of one biographer, “for want of adequate room, the pictures
 were crammed into all vacant places, or arranged along the arcade, 
where, being exposed in the open air to the alternate action of moisture
 and frost, they were almost entirely destroyed in the course of the 
winter; several, also, were stolen.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn35" name="fr35" id="fr35">[35]</a>
 The chaos of Romney’s studio was no doubt related to, and in a sense 
mirrored, the bipolar disorder that increasingly afflicted him. We can 
only imagine what happened after he left Hampstead not long afterward 
and then died in Kendal in November 1802. Benjamin West was so horrified
 by the state of Romney’s paintings that he began cleaning and arranging
 his own, he told Farington, so that “in case He <em>should drop</em>, 
His House may not be found like those of Romney &amp; Opie full of 
rubbish that it was disgraceful to them to have brought forward to a 
sale.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn36" name="fr36" id="fr36">[36]</a> In undertaking to search for Romney’s originals, Blake took on what would be a difficult and time-consuming task.</td>

custody of most of Romney’s unsold paintings. (Saunders was Romney’s 
framemaker from 1782 on, and the two had enjoyed a close business 
relationship.)&nbsp;<a href="#fn37" name="fr37" id="fr37">[37]</a> Blake
 mentions calling on Saunders on Hayley’s behalf in letters to Hayley of
 26 October and 13 December 1803, 21 March 1804, and 11 December 1805. 
After his first visit, Blake reported:
<blockquote>I have been with Mr. Saunders who has now in his possession 
all Mr. Romney’s pictures that remained after the sale at Hampstead; I 
saw <em>Milton and his Daughters</em>, and <em>’Twas where the Seas were Roaring</em>, and a beautiful <em>Female head</em>.
 He has promised to write a list of all that he has in his possession, 
and of all that he remembers of Mr. Romney’s paintings, with notices 
where they now are, as far as his recollection will serve. The picture 
of <em>Christ in the Desert</em> he supposes to be one of those which he
 has rolled on large rollers. He will take them down and unroll them, 
but cannot do it easily, as they are so large as to occupy the whole 
length of his workshop, and are laid across beams at the top. (E 737)</blockquote>
Three of these paintings can be identified (as Romney executed numerous 
beautiful female heads, it is impossible to say which Blake saw). <em>Milton and His Daughters</em>
 (private collection), depicting the blind Milton being read to, would 
have made for an excellent engraving because of its dramatic lights and 
darks, but it was not chosen, perhaps because it had already been 
engraved by Benjamin Smith in 1795. <em>’Twas Where </em>[<em>sic</em>] <em>the Seas Were Roaring</em>
 was no. 117 in the 1807 sale of Romney’s paintings, described as “a 
despondent Female, seated upon a Rock, overpowered with Grief; a gleam 
of Light is thrown upon the Breast and Arms of the Female with Richest 
effect.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn38" name="fr38" id="fr38">[38]</a> A detail of the large, rolled-up picture of Christ in the desert, known under the title of <em>The Temptation in the Wilderness</em>,
 was later engraved, though not by Blake, for Hayley’s biography; it 
will be discussed below with the other illustrations for the book.</td>

      <td class="body">Saunders was as good as his word, though not 
until 5 January 1804, when he wrote to Hayley that at Blake’s request he
 had made a list of Romney’s “most Capital paintings” with their 
owners.&nbsp;<a href="#fn39" name="fr39" id="fr39">[39]</a> The first 
whom Blake had called on was the astronomer and lecturer Adam Walker, a 
member of the Unincreasable Club, an informal group including Romney who
 dined and went to the theater together from time to time.&nbsp;<a href="#fn40" name="fr40" id="fr40">[40]</a>
 One of Romney’s oldest friends, Walker had been with the artist in 
Lancaster and had posed for some of his pictures there. The closeness of
 their relationship is epitomized by two paintings and the span of time 
between them. Walker was the subject of what may have been Romney’s 
earliest portrait,&nbsp;<a href="#fn41" name="fr41" id="fr41">[41]</a> while <em>The Walker Family</em>
 (National Portrait Gallery, London), showing Walker and his wife and 
daughter poring over an astronomical chart while Walker’s sons discuss 
what they have seen through a telescope pointed toward the night sky, is
 among Romney’s very last works. On 27 January 1804 Blake reported to 
Hayley that he had called on Walker, but that Walker was away on an 
extended trip to Birmingham (E 740). After one more unsuccessful 
attempt, Blake could at last write to Hayley on 4 May 1804:
<blockquote>I have seen the elder Mr. Walker. … Mr. Walker showed me 
Romney’s first attempt at oil painting; it is a copy from a Dutch 
picture—Dutch boor smoking; on the back is written, “This was the first 
attempt at oil painting by G. Romney.” He shew’d me also the last 
performance of Romney. It is of Mr. Walker and family, the draperies put
 in by somebody else. It is a very excellent picture, but unfinished. 
The figures as large as life, half length, Mr. W., three sons, and, I 
believe, two daughters, with maps, instruments, &amp;c. Mr. Walker also 
shew’d me a portrait of himself (W.), whole length, on a canvas about 
two feet by one and a half; it is the first portrait Romney ever 
painted. But above all, a picture of <em>Lear and Cordelia</em>, when he
 awakes and knows her,—an incomparable production, which Mr. W. bought 
for five shillings at a broker’s shop; it is about five feet by four, 
and exquisite for expression; indeed, it is most pathetic; the heads of 
Lear and Cordelia can never be surpassed, and Kent and the other 
attendant are admirable; the picture is very highly finished. (E 748)</blockquote></td>

      <td class="body"><em>Lear and Cordelia</em> (location unknown) was
 one of the early pictures that Romney sold by lottery in Kendal in 
1762. It had been won by a Mr. Richardson in Cartmel, and by coincidence
 was bought by Adam Walker’s son in a shop in Kensington many years 
later.&nbsp;<a href="#fn42" name="fr42" id="fr42">[42]</a> William Pressly remarks that a sketch on a related subject, <em>The Death of Cordelia</em>
 (1775-77, Folger Shakespeare Library), “exhibits a stately, 
classicizing elegance, whose languid curves and slow rhythms exerted 
such a strong influence on William Blake.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn43" name="fr43" id="fr43">[43]</a> One might well think of Blake’s early watercolor <em>Lear and Cordelia in Prison</em> (c. 1779) in this regard. On 28 May 1804 Blake informed Hayley that Walker “says that I shall have <em>Lear and Cordelia</em>
 to copy if you desire it should be done” (E 750). Despite the 
availability of the painting and Blake’s admiration of it, it was not to
 be included among the designs engraved for Hayley’s <em>Life</em>.</td>

      <td class="body">Daniel Braithwaite, another Unincreasable and one
 of Romney’s first patrons, was an official in the post office when 
Romney met him shortly after moving to London in March 1762. Hayley was 
to dedicate his <em>Life of Romney</em> to him. Blake visited him by 23 
February 1804, when he informed Hayley: “He gives a very spirited 
assurance of Mr John Romneys interesting himself in the great object of 
his Fathers Fame &amp; thinks that he must be proud of such a work &amp;
 in such hands. The Picture from Sterne which you desired him to procure
 for you; he has not yet found where it is. Supposes that it may be in 
the north &amp; that he may learn from M<sup>r</sup> Romney who will be in town soon—” (E 741). “M<sup>r</sup>
 Romney” is the painter’s son, John, and “in the north” refers to John’s
 residence in Kendal, where he kept some of his father’s art. More must 
be said about John Romney shortly. Braithwaite showed Blake “a very fine
 Portrait of M<sup>rs</sup> Siddons (by Romney) as the Tragic Muse half length. that is the Head &amp; hands. &amp; in his best Style” (E 741-42).&nbsp;<a href="#fn44" name="fr44" id="fr44">[44]</a>
 This beautiful, though unfinished, painting might have been engraved 
splendidly, but evidently Hayley was not interested. A suggestion from 
Braithwaite did, however, catch his attention. “He also desires me,” 
wrote Blake, “to express to you his wish that you would give the Public 
an Engraving of that Medallion by your Sons matchless hand which is 
placd over his chimney piece.” Hayley had already decided to include 
this, writing to Flaxman as early as 7 August 1803 that he had Blake in 
mind as the engraver of both the medallion and of Romney’s 
self-portrait, but was “astonished” by Blake’s asking thirty guineas for
 the former and forty guineas for the latter.&nbsp;<a href="#fn45" name="fr45" id="fr45">[45]</a>
 It appears that Blake continued to hope to engrave the medallion, but 
he accepted the inevitable by 7 August 1804, writing to Hayley that 
“Miss. W[atson]. would Engrave your Sons Medallion of Romney most 
delicately.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn46" name="fr46" id="fr46">[46]</a></td>

      <td class="body">How did Hayley go about choosing what pictures should be engraved for his <em>Life of Romney</em>?
 He evidently asked early on for advice from Flaxman, whose reply, had 
Hayley followed his recommendations, might have resulted in a beautiful 
book. Flaxman wrote on 2 January 1804 to remind Hayley that Hayley had 
once considered a group of Romney’s cartoons “the noblest of his 
Studies,” and went on to indicate some of their subjects: “A Lapland 
Witch raising a Storm—Charity &amp; her Children—Pliny &amp; his Mother 
flying from the eruption of Vesuvius—the following from Æschylus—Raising
 the Ghost of Darius—Atossa’s Dream—The Furies” (<em>BR</em>[2] 177). He
 then recommended Blake for the engraving job: “they are all well worth 
etching in a bold manner which I think Blake is likely to do with great 
success &amp; perhaps at an expence that will not be burthensome—but at 
any rate give him one to do first for a tryal ….” Hayley at first tried 
to follow Flaxman’s advice. On 16 January he drafted a letter to John 
Romney. He assured him that, although the artist had promised Hayley 
“half a dozen” of these pictures, he did not wish them for himself but 
merely as a loan for which he would pay carriage, specifying two from 
Flaxman’s list. “I wish you would allow Mr Blake to copy two of them if 
they are still in London—particularly the Lapland Witch raising a Storm a
 design that our Friend Meyer used to call equal to any Figure of 
Michael Angelos—&amp; Pliny the younger with his Mother in the scene of 
the Earthquake.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn47" name="fr47" id="fr47">[47]</a></td>

    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">15</td>
      <td class="body">The “Lapland Witch,” Hayley explains in the <em>Life of Romney</em>, could not be found. “I have mentioned this design in the poetical Epistles addrest to Romney,&nbsp;<a href="#fn48" name="fr48" id="fr48">[48]</a>
 and had hoped to decorate this volume with a good engraving from the 
cartoon, which the son of my departed friend had kindly intended to 
present to me, but after a diligent search for it in a mass of many 
large works, that were huddled together in the haste of the retiring 
painter to clear his London house, we had the mortification to perceive,
 that some mischance had annihilated this favorite design.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn49" name="fr49" id="fr49">[49]</a>
 However, that was not true of most of the other drawings that Flaxman 
recommended, and that he continued to recommend. On 22 June 1804 Blake

      <td class="body">What were these pictures, and how suitable were they for engraved illustrations? Numbers 1 and 2 are illustrations from <em>The Persae</em> of Aeschylus, first published in an English translation by Robert Potter in 1777. (Flaxman’s own <em>Compositions from the Tragedies of Aeschylus</em>,&nbsp;<a href="#fn50" name="fr50" id="fr50">[50]</a> which included four illustrations of <em>The Persae</em>
 based on Potter’s translation, was to appear eighteen years later.) 
Potter sat to Romney for his portrait in 1778, and the two got on so 
well that Romney made him a present of the finished portrait in August 
1779.&nbsp;<a href="#fn51" name="fr51" id="fr51">[51]</a> Their 
conversations led Romney, who often got his ideas for imaginative 
subjects from friends, to make two finished drawings on subjects from <em>The Persae</em>.
 Potter wrote in a note in his second edition, “The excellent Mr. Romney
 gave a strong instance of his good sense and fine taste, when he called
 Æschylus ‘the painter’s poet:’ the public may expect to see this scene,
 and some others, designed by him in the genuine spirit of Æschylus; so 
that the translator will have this merit, if he has no other, to have 
given rise to some paintings that will do honour to our country.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn52" name="fr52" id="fr52">[52]</a> Romney must have been buoyed by this encouragement, as he later was by “the fervent praise” of Joseph Warton, who had seen <em>Atossa’s Dream</em> in London in 1794.&nbsp;<a href="#fn53" name="fr53" id="fr53">[53]</a> At this time, Aeschylus was valued for his “primitive” qualities,&nbsp;<a href="#fn54" name="fr54" id="fr54">[54]</a>
 and so Romney here was at the cutting edge of contemporary taste. This 
picture and its companion also show something of what Romney and Blake 
had in common: <em>Atossa’s Dream</em> is strikingly Blake-like, as is <em>The Ghost of Darius Appearing to Atossa</em>.
 In the latter the crowned head of Darius and his woeful expression 
foreshadow Blake’s renderings of Nebuchadnezzar, and his white beard, 
outstretched arms, and mantle, seen through the smoke of the altar, 
anticipate Urizen.&nbsp;<a href="#fn55" name="fr55" id="fr55">[55]</a> The three elders, bent over on their knees to our left, anticipate Job’s slouched-over comforters in the <em>Illustrations of the Book of Job</em>: “Let the Day Perish Wherein I Was Born” (<a href="45.2.paleyjob" target="_blank">illus. 3</a>) and “Then the Lord Answered Job out of the Whirlwind”<em> </em>(note the visible hands, which are also a detail in Romney’s drawing).<div class="illus"><img src="314.jpg" alt="Let the Day Perish Wherein I Was Born" height="266" width="200"><div>3.

Farewell to Black-Eyed Susan,” published in his <em>Poems on Several Occasions</em>
 (1720). There is a puzzle about this title. The poem is about a woman 
who boards her sailor sweetheart’s warship and takes a tearful farewell 
before he sails.&nbsp;<a href="#fn56" name="fr56" id="fr56">[56]</a> It does not feature “a figure on the Sea shore embracing a Corse” or anything like it<em>.

 He also says, confusingly, that among the drawings he presented to the 
Fitzwilliam Museum in 1817 were “V. 3rd. The Damsel; from the ballad, 
‘’Twas when the seas were roaring,’ &amp;c. Or perhaps a personification
 of Sorrow” and “XIII. 3rd. From the ballad, ‘’Twas when the seas were

 It is about a woman who imagines the death of her lover at sea and then
 sees his corpse in the water (although the corpse remains there and she
 does not embrace it). Evidently either Flaxman or Blake made a slip, 
conflating the titles of two well-known poems.&nbsp;<a href="#fn60" name="fr60" id="fr60">[60]</a> Romney’s <em>’Twas When the Seas Were Roaring</em> was not selected for engraving, and its location is unknown.</td>

 to Hayley earlier: “Mr. Flaxman advises that the drawing of Mr. 
Romney’s which shall be chosen instead of the Witch (if that cannot be 
recovered) be Hecate, the figure with the torch and snake, which he 
thinks one of the finest drawings” (2 April 1804, E 745). Blake urged 
Hayley to choose it over the Pliny: “The two Cartoons which I have of 
Hecate &amp; Pliny are very unequal in point of finishing the Pliny in 
[is] a Sketch tho admirably contrived for an Effect equal to Rembrandt. 
But the Hecate is a finishd Production which will call for all the 
Engravers nicest attention” (28 December 1804, E 760). Blake continued 
in a way that suggests that, after having been commissioned to engrave <em>The Shipwreck</em> as well as the book’s frontispiece, he was now lobbying for a chance to do <em>Hecate</em>:
 “indeed it is more finishd than the Shipwreck it is every body[s] 
favourite who have seen it &amp; they regularly prefer it to the 
Shipwreck as a work of Genius As to the [<em>Plates</em>] Price of the 
Plates Flaxman declares to me that he will not pretend to set a price 
upon Engraving. I think it can only be done by some Engraver. I 
consulted M<sup>r</sup> Parker on the subject before I decided on the 
Shipwreck &amp; it was his opinion &amp; he says it still is so that a 
Print of that size cannot be done under 30 Guineas if finishd, &amp; if a
 Sketch. 15 Guineas as therefore Hecate must be a Finishd Plate I

were in the possession of John Romney,&nbsp;<a href="#fn61" name="fr61" id="fr61">[61]</a> who, according to Hayley, had been willing to allow the engraving of the lost <em>Lapland Witch</em>. The only picture from either list to appear in Hayley’s <em>Life</em> was Blake’s fine engraving of <em>The Shipwreck</em>,
 which was among the pictures held by Saunders. Hayley’s failure to 
include any of the others made a considerable difference in the

of an artist—as did his change in priorities regarding engravers.</td>

      <td class="body">All this time Blake had been confident of having a major role in engraving the designs for the <em>Life of Romney</em>.
 His connection with the project had begun while he was still living in 
Felpham and had executed two miniatures of Romney for Hayley, copied 
from self-portraits in Hayley’s possession.&nbsp;<a href="#fn62" name="fr62" id="fr62">[62]</a>
 From one of these he no doubt made a drawing as the basis for a 
portrait engraving to serve as the book’s frontispiece. He showed a 
proof of this engraving to Romney’s friends from time to time, and at 
every opportunity he let Hayley know how they considered his rendering 
of Romney exact.&nbsp;<a href="#fn63" name="fr63" id="fr63">[63]</a> In the newly rediscovered letter of 7 August 1804 he wrote: “the Plate [of <em>The Shipwreck</em>] goes on with Spirit &amp; neatness as does Romneys Head.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn64" name="fr64" id="fr64">[64]</a>
 After his artistic epiphany connected with visiting the Truchsessian 
Gallery, Blake declared “I am become suddenly as I was at first,” and 
that he would demonstrate this “by producing the <em>Head of Romney</em> and the<em> Shipwreck</em>
 quite another thing from what you or I ever expected them to be” (23 
October 1804, E 757). As late as 28 December 1804 he still expected to 
be the engraver of the frontispiece. “I am very far,” he wrote to Hayley
 on that date, “from shewing the Portrait of Romney as a finishd Proof. 
be assured that with our Good Flaxmans good help &amp; with your remarks
 on it in addition I hope to make it a Supernaculum.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn65" name="fr65" id="fr65">[65]</a>
 However, despite Blake’s efforts, when the book was at last published 
in 1809, the frontispiece was an engraving by Caroline Watson (<a href="45.2.paleyfrontispiece" target="_blank">illus. 4</a>), showing Romney at three different ages, and six other engravings were by Watson as well, with only one, “The Shipwreck” (<a href="45.2.paleyshipwreck" target="_blank">illus. 5</a>), by Blake.<div class="illus"><img src="315.jpg" alt="Caroline Watson's frontispiece for Hayley's Life of Romney" height="229" width="200"><div>4.

      <td class="body">Watson, who succeeded Blake in several of 
Hayley’s projects during these early years of the nineteenth century, 
was a highly capable graphic artist, especially of portraits. She had 
been made engraver to the queen in 1785, the year in which she executed 
individual portraits of two daughters of Queen Charlotte after John 
Hoppner. Among her best-known works is her fine engraving of Sir Joshua 
Reynolds’s bespectacled self-portrait, which appeared as the 
frontispiece to the edition of Reynolds’s <em>Works</em> that Blake 
owned and savagely annotated. Arthur M. Hind does justice to Watson’s 
strengths and weaknesses in writing that “Caroline Watson … is the 
miniaturist in style among the stipple engravers. Her surface is of the 
closest and finest texture … and suffers from the excess of its quality,
 while her design lacks grip and robustness. … She engraved one plate 
for the <em>Shakespeare Gallery</em>, but subjects on this scale were too large for her delicate talent.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn66" name="fr66" id="fr66">[66]</a>
 Although of course Watson was merely practicing her trade, in Blake’s 
eyes her supplanting him as Hayley’s chief engraver would have been a 
terrible slight; Robert Essick has suggested that for Blake she became 
an aspect of the principle of domination that he called the Female 
Will.&nbsp;<a href="#fn67" name="fr67" id="fr67">[67]</a> The first indication that Blake had of being superseded by Watson was learning that in the octavo edition of Hayley’s <em>Life of William Cowper</em>
 (published 1806) Watson’s portrait engraving of Cowper would replace 
his own. One of Blake’s miniatures after Romney’s portrait of the poet 
had disturbed Lady Hesketh, Cowper’s cousin and Hayley’s friend, because
 she had seen in the image a suggestion of Cowper’s insanity, which she 
would not allow to be mentioned in the <em>Life</em>.&nbsp;<a href="#fn68" name="fr68" id="fr68">[68]</a> Although she later relented about Blake’s portrait engraving of the poet, finding the published engraving “<u>Softened</u>,” she was unequivocal in her support of Watson (<em>BR</em>[2]
 147, 197). Blake tried to put a good face on it, writing to Hayley on 
22 March 1805: “The Idea of Seeing an Engraving of Cowper by the hand of
 Caroline Watson is I assure you a pleasing one to me it will be highly 
gratifying to see another Copy by another hand &amp; not only gratifying
 but Improving. which is better” (E 764). These can hardly have been 
Blake’s real feelings in this matter. In addition to feeling 
professionally injured, he must have resented losing the fee he would 
have earned for a reduced engraving.&nbsp;<a href="#fn69" name="fr69" id="fr69">[69]</a> The fact that Flaxman, who in 1804 had urged Hayley not to employ Watson as an engraver (<em>BR</em>[2] 194-95), nevertheless advised her on this engraving&nbsp;<a href="#fn70" name="fr70" id="fr70">[70]</a> may have appeared to Blake another betrayal.</td>

      <td class="body">Flaxman had been candid to Hayley about his view 
of Watson. He had seen two of her engravings after children’s heads by 
William Beechey that were “so miserably executed that similar engraving 
instead of being a decoration, would be a blemish in your Book” (16 June
 1804, <em>BR</em>[2] 195). Indeed, Flaxman continued, “if … you still 
continue in the same resolution as at first I will deliver Your 
Commission but there my interference must cease &amp; all further 
communication must be between the Engraver &amp; Yourself, because I 
foresee that the conclusion of such an engagement must be unsatisfactory
 to all parties concerned.” Hayley was, clearly, determined not to take 
Flaxman’s advice on this matter, and in 1806 he invited Watson to 
Felpham to copy some of Romney’s originals for the purpose of engraving 
them in London. It is disappointing to find young Edward Garrard Marsh, 
whom Blake had praised as “my much admired &amp; respected Edward the 
Bard of Oxford,”&nbsp;<a href="#fn71" name="fr71" id="fr71">[71]</a> 
later congratulating Hayley on his choice: “Caroline Watson’s engravings
 are beautiful in the extreme; and you never made a happier exchange 
than when you employed her instead of Blake” (<em>BR</em>[2] 295). 
(Hayley’s friends had a marked tendency to agree with him, unless they 
were in positions of independent power as were Lady Hesketh and 
Flaxman.) According to Hayley, he had been drawn to Watson by “a 
peculiar tenderness of admiration, with which Romney contemplated an 
exquisite engraving [by Watson] of Sir Joshua’s portrait, prefixed to 
the quarto edition of his works, in 1797.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn72" name="fr72" id="fr72">[72]</a> Hayley may have also had another motive in inviting Watson to stay for “some weeks.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn73" name="fr73" id="fr73">[73]</a>
 His estranged wife, Eliza, had died in 1797, and evidently he had no 
inclination to remain “The Hermit,” as he liked to sign himself, 
literally. In 1801 he was thought to be about to marry Penelope Carleton
 Chetwynd, an attractive widow (born c. 1762) temporarily resident in 
Felpham.&nbsp;<a href="#fn74" name="fr74" id="fr74">[74]</a> This did 
not happen, but in October 1808 he met and courted Mary Welford, whom he
 married on 28 March of the following year.&nbsp;<a href="#fn75" name="fr75" id="fr75">[75]</a>
 Perhaps, although she may well have been unaware of it, Hayley had 
earlier entertained the idea of the unmarried Caroline Watson, who was 
about forty-five at the time, as a candidate. If Blake suspected this, 
it would further strengthen Essick’s argument that Blake identified 
Watson with the Female Will.</td>

      <td class="body">Blake pursued Romney-related errands for Hayley 
throughout 1804, which he is unlikely to have done had he not 
anticipated a major role in the engraving of illustrations for the <em>Life</em>.
 He worked on two plates for it during that year. One was after Romney’s
 self-portrait for the frontispiece, the other “The Shipwreck,” after 
Romney’s painting of a rescue at the Cape of Good Hope. On 16 July 1804 
he sent Hayley a progress proof of the former and a sketch for the 
latter (<a href="45.2.paleyshipwreckdrawing" target="_blank">illus. 6</a>), along with the newly published <em>Correspondence</em> of Samuel Richardson,&nbsp;<a href="#fn76" name="fr76" id="fr76">[76]</a>
 which after several attempts he had succeeded in getting from its 
publisher, Richard Phillips. Evidently Blake had previously disagreed 
with Hayley about Richardson, for he now declared that “Richardson has 
won my heart I will again read Clarissa &amp;<sup>c</sup> they 
[Richardson’s novels] must be admirable I was too hasty in my perusal of
 them to percieve all their beauty” (E 754). It is hard to believe that 
this profession can be entirely sincere, coming from a man who had 
written just a few years earlier (of Henry Boyd’s moralistic view of the<em> Odyssey</em>),
 “If Homers merit was only in these Historical combinations &amp; Moral 
sentiments he would be no better than Clarissa” (E 633). Of the book’s 
frontispiece to volume one, engraved after Joseph Highmore by Watson, 
Blake declared: “I admire Miss Watsons head of Richardson it is truly 
delicate ‘The patient touches of unwearid Art’” (E 754). Delicacy could 
be Watson’s specialty, but this is a very ordinary stipple engraving; in
 quoting Pope’s description of a monument to Virgil in <em>The Temple of Fame</em>, Blake, who disliked Pope and abominated Virgil,&nbsp;<a href="#fn77" name="fr77" id="fr77">[77]</a> was no doubt engaging in a private joke while humoring Hayley, who was still a potential source of engraving commissions.<div class="illus"><img src="317.jpg" alt="Blake's drawing of Romney's The Shipwreck" height="153" width="200"><div>6.

engraving to be included was “The Shipwreck,” dated 14 April 1809,&nbsp;<a href="#fn78" name="fr78" id="fr78">[78]</a>
 though finished no later than 1805. The original oil sketch (location 
unknown) is called “animated tho’ unfinished” by Hayley, who says that 
the subject was suggested to Romney by the Rev. James Stanier 
Clarke.&nbsp;<a href="#fn79" name="fr79" id="fr79">[79]</a> The story comes from a book by the Swedish botanist and travel writer Carl Peter Thunberg, <em>Travels in Europe, Africa, and Asia, Made between the Years 1770 and 1779</em>.&nbsp;<a href="#fn80" name="fr80" id="fr80">[80]</a>
 Thunberg presents the story of a shipwreck off the Cape of Good Hope as
 involving “action that does great honour to humanity.” Seeing the 
victims offshore, “an old man, of the name of W<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">oltemad</span>,
 by birth an European, … borrowed a horse, and … resolved to ride … to 
the wreck, with a view of saving some of them.” Woltemad’s heroism ended
 tragically. “He repeated this dangerous trip six times more, bringing 
each time two men alive on shore, and thus saved in all fourteen 
persons. The horse was by this time so much fatigued, that he did not 
think it prudent to venture out again; but the cries and intreaties of 
the poor wretches on the wreck increasing, he ventured to take one trip 
more, which proved so unfortunate, that he lost his own life ….”</td>

      <td class="body">Romney would have been interested in this story 
for its humanitarian content—Victor Chan links it to his many drawings 
connected with the prison reformer John Howard. James Stanier Clarke was
 certainly aware of the story, for he commissioned the first published 
illustration of the scene in his capacity as an editor of the <em>Naval Chronicle</em>.
 A copy of Romney’s picture by his student, Isaac Pocock, Jr., was used 
as the basis for an aquatint, “Shipwreck at the Cape of Good Hope” by 
Thomas Medland, which appeared in the <em>Naval Chronicle</em> in 1800.&nbsp;<a href="#fn81" name="fr81" id="fr81">[81]</a>
 According to the accompanying text, Pocock’s drawing was taken “from 
the large Painting by George Romney, Esq. in his Gallery at <em>Hampstead</em>.” Thus Blake’s was not the first print after Romney’s <em>Shipwreck</em>.
 It is, however, both clearer and more spirited than Medland’s, showing a
 swirl of motion among the victims of the wreck and the heroic horseman 
who has ridden into the waves to help them. A striking difference 
between Thunberg’s account and Romney’s representation is the age of the
 hero. Thunberg stresses the advanced age of Woltemad, calling him a 
“worthy veteran” and a “hoary sire.” However, Blake’s print (like 
Medland’s) shows a powerful, muscular young man fighting the waves. 
Romney probably thought this a more dramatic visual concept. It may also
 be, as Chan interestingly speculates, that Romney thought of Woltemad 
as a Christ figure rescuing souls.&nbsp;<a href="#fn82" name="fr82" id="fr82">[82]</a></td>

      <td class="body">“The Shipwreck” was the only engraving Blake 
contributed to Hayley’s biography. Seven of the remaining eleven were by
 Watson. Despite his early and prolonged involvement with the Romney 
project, Blake had been superseded by a highly successful stipple 
engraver and placed among other contemporaries who were competent at 
best. This appears to mark a more general cooling of Hayley toward 
Blake’s work after Blake left Felpham. It may be that Hayley was happy 
to cut his ties with the <em>vates irritabilis</em> and found relief in 
working with an engraver who had no claims to inspiration. Another 
instance of Hayley’s withdrawal from Blake may be seen in the thirteenth
 edition of his perennial best-seller <em>The Triumphs of Temper</em>. 
For the twelfth edition (1803) Blake had executed new engravings after 
six engaging designs by Maria Flaxman. These replaced the Thomas 
Stothard illustrations that had been engraved by William Sharp, James 
Heath, and James Neagle and used in the six previous editions. In 1807 <em>Triumphs</em>
 appeared in a thirteenth edition, one (very rare) printing of which 
features the Flaxman-Blake images, another the engravings after Stothard
 previously published.&nbsp;<a href="#fn83" name="fr83" id="fr83">[83]</a>
 It appears that Hayley changed horses in midstream, eliminating Blake’s
 engravings after Maria Flaxman’s decidedly superior drawings and going 
back to their banal predecessors for the rest of the thirteenth 
edition.&nbsp;<a href="#fn84" name="fr84" id="fr84">[84]</a> The reason 
for this unusual procedure appears to be that Blake’s copperplates 
showed unexpected signs of early wear. Essick remarks that “the plates 
are quite worn in the 1807 edition” and specifies that in plate 6 “the 4
 cm. horizontal scratch, running 2.5 cm. above the lower margin of the 
design, wore off the plate in the course of the 1803 printing and thus 
appears as only a faint shadow line in the 1807 edition.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn85" name="fr85" id="fr85">[85]</a></td>

stated to Flaxman (through what Bentley calls “a semi-literate 
amanuensis”) “I should like to employ your Freand Cromak on the Ship 
wreck you mention,” and was deterred only by the fact that Blake had 
already taken the picture home from Saunders’s: “I should be sorry to

 oil sketch from his possassion to the House of any other 
Engraver.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn86" name="fr86" id="fr86">[86]</a> Had it

self-portraits in Hayley’s possession, at different ages. The largest of

justly been called “one of the greatest self-portraits of the eighteenth
 century.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn88" name="fr88" id="fr88">[88]</a> The other
 two are identified by John Ingamells as a watercolor (untraced) drawn

crayon drawing of a bespectacled Romney (also untraced) of 1799.&nbsp;<a href="#fn89" name="fr89" id="fr89">[89]</a> All three heads are sensitively rendered as to both contour and expression.</td>

 more difficult to appreciate in our own, hovering as it does between 
charm and silliness. Watson’s placing her subject in an oval frame is 
perhaps an attempt to emphasize the former and ward off the latter by 
underlining the consciously fictive nature of the scene. Watson also 
produced a very competent engraving, from Maria Denman’s drawing, of 
Thomas Alphonso Hayley’s portrait medallion. Unfortunately, her other 
engravings for the book are in some ways problematic. The fault was not

 (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco), the subject of which Romney and 
Hayley had met in Paris in 1790, and whom Romney painted in London in 
1792. The author of<em> Lessons of a Governess to Her Pupils</em> 
(London, 1792) is depicted dramatically and somewhat exotically, wearing
 a large scarf on her head and a shawl over her shoulders. Watson failed
 to find a graphic equivalent for the delicate, pastel-like coloring of 
the original, and her portrayal seems vulgar by comparison. Three other 
engravings are after works owned by Hayley for which Hart alone had 
served as a model: “Miranda,” “Cassandra,” and “Sensibility.” The head 
of Miranda&nbsp;<a href="#fn95" name="fr95" id="fr95">[95]</a> is similar to that in Romney’s large <em>Tempest</em> painting for the Shakespeare Gallery, now existing only in fragmentary form.&nbsp;<a href="#fn96" name="fr96" id="fr96">[96]</a>
 Watson’s engraving suffers especially from having no equivalent to the 
lushly contrasting reds of Miranda’s hair, gown, and lips. <em>Cassandra</em> too was modeled by Hart for exhibition in Boydell’s Shakespeare Gallery (though begun earlier),&nbsp;<a href="#fn97" name="fr97" id="fr97">[97]</a> this time ostensibly illustrating <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>.
 Another version was sold in the 1807 Romney sale; both are untraced, 
and the full-length picture is known only through Francis Legat’s line 
engraving, dated 1 January 1795. In this instance Romney produced at 
least three heads of his subject,&nbsp;<a href="#fn98" name="fr98" id="fr98">[98]</a> one of which was owned by Hayley. Watson no doubt took the opportunity to copy it in 1806.&nbsp;<a href="#fn99" name="fr99" id="fr99">[99]</a>
 Cassandra’s hair in Watson’s engraving is considerably wilder than it 
is in the Boydell painting (as known through Legat’s engraving), as it 
also is in the surviving small painting (Tate Britain), and the 
engraving is more melodramatic than dramatic. <em>Sensibility</em> (Jay I. Kislak Foundation),&nbsp;<a href="#fn100" name="fr100" id="fr100">[100]</a>
 painted in 1786, began as a beautiful head; Hayley claims credit for 
encouraging Romney to transform it to full length: “You have only to 
enlarge your canvas,” he told Romney, “introduce the shrub mimosa, 
growing in a vase, with a hand of this figure approaching its leaves, 
and you may call your picture a personification of Sensibility.” Hayley 
says that he then hastened to “an eminent nurseryman at Hammersmith” and
 returned with the mimosa that the artist painted in the lower 
right.&nbsp;<a href="#fn101" name="fr101" id="fr101">[101]</a> Watson in
 her engraving brought the picture back to a head alone, but retained 
its botanical element by moving the mimosa close in (possibly as a wall 
painting). Hayley afterwards acquired the original as part of a 
real-estate transaction.&nbsp;<a href="#fn102" name="fr102" id="fr102">[102]</a></td>

every passion, with a most fascinating truth, and felicity of

may perhaps be linked to a local quarrel rather than to art. <em>Dr. Slop</em>
 could be, as Geoffrey Keynes suggests, “the Picture from Sterne” that 
Blake told Hayley he was searching for in his letter of 23 February 1804
 (E 741),&nbsp;<a href="#fn107" name="fr107" id="fr107">[107]</a> and Blake may already have been on the track of it when he informed Hayley that “M<sup>r</sup> Flaxman is not at all acquainted with S<sup>r</sup> Allan Chambre [<em>sic</em>]”
 (27 January 1804, E 741). As it turned out, Chambré did own the 
picture, having received it from the person who won it in Romney’s 
Kendal lottery in 1762.&nbsp;<a href="#fn108" name="fr108" id="fr108">[108]</a>
 “The Picture from Sterne” that Blake sought may, alternatively, have 
been one of two other early paintings of Shandean subjects that Hayley 
mentions. One represented the death of Lieutenant Le Fever and, as Adam 
Walker told Hayley, “was much admired.” Walker continued:
<blockquote>The figures were about eighteen inches long, and wonderfully
 expressive. The dying lieutenant was looking at Uncle Toby (who sat 
mute at the foot of the bed) and by the motion of his hand was 
recommending his son to his care: The boy was kneeling by the bedside, 
and with eyes that expressed his anguish of heart was, as it were, 
turning from a dying to a living father, begging protection, a most 
pathetic figure. Trim was standing at a distance in his usual attitude, 
and with a face full of inward grief. What became of this admirable 
picture I cannot tell.&nbsp;<a href="#fn109" name="fr109" id="fr109">[109]</a></blockquote>
Hayley adds that Romney’s friends regarded this work as “a master piece 
of pathetic expression … Mr. Braithwaite …thought it the most affecting 
picture he ever beheld.” But despite all efforts, the picture could not 
be found. Neither could what Hayley declared was Romney’s own favorite 
comic picture showing “Obadiah making his bow to Dr. Slop as the Doctor 
is falling in the dirty lane.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn110" name="fr110" id="fr110">[110]</a>
 However, Hayley declared Chambré ’s painting “a work of great comic 
power.” Romney, who, while apprenticed to Christopher Steele, had 
probably heard Sterne read passages from his novel in Steele’s 
studio,&nbsp;<a href="#fn111" name="fr111" id="fr111">[111]</a> 
accurately depicts Dr. Slop as described in chapters nine and ten of 
volume two: “a little, squat, uncourtly figure … of about four feet and a
 half perpendicular height, with a breadth of back, and a sesquipedality
 of belly, which might have done honour to a serjeant in the 
horse-guards. … His hinder parts, upon which he had received his fall, 
totally besmear’d,—and in every other part of him, blotched over 
….”&nbsp;<a href="#fn112" name="fr112" id="fr112">[112]</a> Working in this comic vein was to become unusual for Romney. Haines’s engraving is one of the few records of it.</td>

      <td class="body">Raimbach engraved a detail from a painting that Blake had looked for at Saunders’s: Romney’s large, unfinished <em>Paradise Regained</em> picture, <em>The Temptation in the Wilderness</em>.
 Hayley does not shrink from giving himself credit for the original 
concept. “In the year 1794, a passage in the Paradise Regained of 
Milton, so forcibly struck me as full of sentiment and picture, that I 
desired my son to transcribe it for Romney. It was the sublime 
description of our Saviour in the wilderness.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn113" name="fr113" id="fr113">[113]</a> He then quotes four lines (4.422-25) of the poem:
<pre><em>Infernal ghosts, and hellish furies, round
Environ’d thee; some howl’d, some yell’d, some shriek’d,
Some bent at thee their fiery darts, while thou
Satst unappall’d in calm and sinless peace.</em></pre>
Hayley had suggested to Flaxman that “if the Figure of Christ in the 
wilderness … begun upon an immense Canvas is sufficiently advanced to 
form a good engraving I should wish your Friend [Cromek] to shew his 
powers in that ….”&nbsp;<a href="#fn114" name="fr114" id="fr114">[114]</a>
 Either the painting was not sufficiently advanced or Raimbach lacked 
the skill to render it adequately, for he shows only Christ’s head and 
shoulders in what Gilchrist justly called “a poor <em>Head of Christ</em>.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn115" name="fr115" id="fr115">[115]</a> (Raimbach generously credited Blake as the better engraver of outlines, but received the commission nevertheless.)&nbsp;<a href="#fn116" name="fr116" id="fr116">[116]</a>
 We do not know what the rest of the picture looked like, which is 
especially unfortunate because Romney painted so few religious subjects.
 “The picture of <em>Christ in the Desert</em> he [Saunders] supposes to
 be one of those which he has rolled on large rollers,” wrote Blake, and
 according to John Romney, it was taken to Christie’s auction rooms with
 his father’s other pictures, but was never unrolled and not located 
afterwards.&nbsp;<a href="#fn117" name="fr117" id="fr117">[117]</a></td>

      <td class="body"><em>Newton with the Prism</em> (private 
collection) was strikingly engraved by Meadows, who had previously 
executed engravings after Henry William Bunbury for Macklin’s Poet’s 
Gallery (another venture from which Blake felt excluded).&nbsp;<a href="#fn118" name="fr118" id="fr118">[118]</a> John Romney gives a concise description of the painting:
<blockquote>It represented that contemplative philosopher seated on the 
right of the picture, attentively observing a Prism, which he holds with
 his right hand in a sun-beam, and two female attendants placed 
opposite; one of whom with a silly kind of laugh is expressing her 
astonishment at the phenomenon of the prismatic colours projected on the
 wall; while the other is in the act of carefully bringing in a caraff 
of water. The composition is simple, according with the sobriety of the 
subject; and the effect beautiful: the countenance of one female is in 
shadow, and that of the other (the laughing girl) in a reflected light, 
or demi-shade. This latter gives a fascinating charm to the 
picture.&nbsp;<a href="#fn119" name="fr119" id="fr119">[119]</a></blockquote>
Meadows’s engraving (<a href="45.2.paleynewton" target="_blank">illus. 7</a>)
 is striking for its contrast of light and dark, which gives something 
of the effect of a mezzotint, but of course the main point of Newton’s 
demonstration, the diffraction of white light into spectral 
colors—Hayley refers to the painting as “Newton, displaying the 
prismatic colours”—cannot be conveyed in black and white.&nbsp;<a href="#fn120" name="fr120" id="fr120">[120]</a>
 Obviously, Meadows cannot be blamed for not having done the impossible;
 the question is why Hayley did not choose the picture that Romney 
regarded as a companion to <em>Newton</em>, <em>Milton and His Daughters</em>,
 then (according to Saunders’s list) in the collection of the brewer and
 radical Samuel Whitbread, which would have been more appropriate for 
monochrome.&nbsp;<a href="#fn121" name="fr121" id="fr121">[121]</a> Perhaps, as suggested above, Hayley avoided the <em>Milton</em> painting because it had already been engraved (by Benjamin Smith) for Hayley’s life of Milton.&nbsp;<a href="#fn122" name="fr122" id="fr122">[122]</a><div class="illus"><img src="318.jpg" alt="Newton with the Prism" height="151" width="200"><div>7.

father, Romney’s friend and former pupil Thomas Robinson of Windermere,

 However, he had to wait for engravings to be completed and so, 
self-consciously using an artist’s term, he continued to “retouch” it. 
He was still “retouching the Life of Romney” early in 1808. He and the 
printer, Joseph Seagrave, “revised” the first proof sheet on 27 March 
1808, and this process continued for several months. Seagrave died on 9 
July 1808, and his successor, Mason, printed the book, which was 
published by T. Payne, London, in the late spring of 1809. Hayley sadly 
remarks that it met with “surprising ill success.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn126" name="fr126" id="fr126">[126]</a></td>

 The verdict: “As a literary composition, it is far below mediocrity; 
and as a critique on art, flimsy and injudicious.” Romney himself was 
condemned as an artist capable of only minor subjects; his figures had 
“more the appearance of coloured statues, than representations of 
animated nature,” and “in his manner of treating the higher walks of 
history … extravagance has been mistaken for sublimity, and praised 
accordingly.” “Romney’s pallet may readily be traced back to the 
colour-shop.” This sheer overkill suggests that Hoppner was jealously 
taking revenge on his deceased, more successful rival. As for the 
reactionary Gifford, whom William Hazlitt was to call “the invisible 
link, that connects literature with the police,”&nbsp;<a href="#fn128" name="fr128" id="fr128">[128]</a>

 attempted to be more evenhanded, saying of Hayley: “His want of 
compression, and his tedious habit of introducing vapid phrases, are 
faults so well known, that they need not our emblazoning. On the other 
hand, his good qualities, his truth, the general correctness of his 
judgment, his experience of the world, and just feeling, his candour and
 liberality, have not been duly appretiated [<em>sic</em>] by our 
contemporaries.” (This last point may suggest what the public reception 
of the book was.) The reviewer devoted more space than most to the 
reproductions of Romney’s paintings, finding them “well chosen specimens
 to exhibit the gradations of his improvement, and the peculiar 
qualities of his style.” “The Miranda,” he wrote, “has exquisite 
expression,” but “Sensibility is too pretty, and Cassandra too like a 
Bacchante of the lowest order.” He found “the introduction of Dr. Slop 
into the parlour of Mr. Shandy … too just and natural to be sufficiently
 humorous.” Of “The Shipwreck” he says (not mentioning Blake) that “the 
sentiment, as observed by Mr. Flaxman, is caught at a glance, the light 
is happily spread upon the gloom, and the confused horrors of the scene 
represented with great clearness and simplicity.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn130" name="fr130" id="fr130">[130]</a>
 “The piece entitled Newton with the Prism … concentrates the 
excellencies of Romney’s manner, namely, character, expression, 
strength, delicacy, grace, simplicity, and the dexterous management of 
light and shadow,” but “the head of our Saviour in the wilderness” was 
“not quite equal to Milton’s description.” “The Infant Shakespeare” was 
“above our praise.”</td>

      <td class="body">The <em>Monthly Review </em>took a sterner line, condemning Hayley’s repetition “almost <em>ad nauseam</em>” of expressions like “‘the <em>tender</em> artist,’—‘the<em> </em>tender and <em>apprehensive</em> artist,’ (the latter is a favourite and frequent adjunct,)—‘the <em>sensitive</em>—the <em>timorous</em>,’—‘our beloved and <em>dejected</em> artist,’—‘the <em>interesting invalid</em>,’ &amp;c.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn131" name="fr131" id="fr131">[131]</a> This reviewer also made an important point in observing that
<blockquote>The expectations of those young artists should have been 
considered, who will open the volume with sanguine hopes of discovering 
the recorded opinions of one of his most distinguished countrymen on the
 works of foreign art, which he frequently explored; and they will close
 it with the greater disappointment, from being informed that the 
professional discussions of Romney, of which no trace is here preserved,
 were eloquent, original, judicious, and so full of vehemence and 
enthusiasm that they frequently betrayed him into tears.</blockquote>
Indeed, as Romney gave no lectures and wrote no art criticism, a 
biographer who had known him for twenty-five years had an unusual 
opportunity to convey both his views about art and the qualities that 
made his conversation on that subject so fascinating, but evidently 
Hayley did not think this part of his responsibility. The reviewer 
mentioned the book’s twelve illustrations in his last paragraph, but his
 only critical judgment was that Watson’s were “charmingly engraved.”</td>

 It said that the volume was “elegantly printed,” and that the 
engravings were “executed principally by Caroline Watson, in a 
peculiarly-elegant and highly-finished style,” listing all the 
illustrations but not naming any other engravers, and concluding with a 
remark that is unlikely to have pleased any of them: “These Engravings, 
we cannot help adding, render this book one of the cheapest purchases 
ever offered to the Publick.” The <em>British Critic</em>, in a mildly 
positive review, closed, curiously enough, on the same note: “The 
engravings by Caroline Watson, are highly spirited and beautiful, and 
would, if there were a deficiency of interest and merit in the book 
itself, which there is not, render it a very cheap purchase.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn133" name="fr133" id="fr133">[133]</a></td>

little knowledge of or interest in art. What made the book, in the words
 of Hayley’s sympathetic biographer Morchard Bishop, “a disastrous 
failure,”&nbsp;<a href="#fn134" name="fr134" id="fr134">[134]</a> was not the reviewers, but the reading public. Two other works that Hayley said met with “surprising ill success” (<em>Memoirs</em> 2: 74-75) were his four-volume edition of Cowper’s Milton (1810) and his <em>Three Plays</em>
 (1811). Recognizing the likelihood that “I have lost my popularity,” 
Hayley published no new works after 1811, although he lived until 
1820.&nbsp;<a href="#fn135" name="fr135" id="fr135">[135]</a> The 
literary euphemisms and affectations that had charmed previous 
generations of readers no longer had such an effect. As late as 1803, 
Hayley’s biography of Cowper had achieved both critical and commercial 
success, but Cowper’s letters had a major role in this, and Romney, as 
Bishop observes, was an indifferent letter writer. Romney’s language was
 pictorial, and Hayley scarcely did him justice in his selection of both
 pictures and engravers. As we have seen, some of his choices appear 
arbitrary and even haphazard with respect to both. As for Blake, he had 
labored for over two years on behalf of the illustrations to Hayley’s 
book only to find himself represented in it by a single engraving. 
Ironically, <em>The Life of George Romney, Esq</em>. is valued today chiefly for Blake’s print of <em>The Shipwreck</em>.</td>

that he had a claim on six pictures that were in John Romney’s 
possession, especially as John, we now know from his <em>Memoirs</em> (124), thought that Hayley had stolen some of his father’s works.</p>
        <p><a href="#fr48" name="fn48" id="fn48">48</a>. Hayley refers to his <em>Poetical Epistle to an Eminent Painter </em>(London: T. Payne et al., 1778), which he reprints in the <em>Life</em>. The lines are:
</p><pre>Round fancy’s circle when thy pencil flies,
With what terrific pomp thy spectres rise!
What lust of mischief marks thy witch’s form,
While on the Lapland rock she swells the storm! (<em>Life </em>374)</pre><p></p>

Potter’s book was in proof (“George Romney, Robert Potter, and ‘the 
Painter’s Poet,’” <em>Transactions of the Romney Society</em> 7 [2002]: 
18). Potter seems to have lost confidence in Romney (and, it appears, 
all other artists) by 1788, when he wrote to the poet Edward Jerningham 
on 15 June: “I know nothing of Macklin or his Exhibitions, unless you 
mean the room of vile pictures from the English Poets near Temple Bar. 
The best picture scene in Aeschylus is the Ghost of Darius rising from 
his tomb; but the Painter would probably make damn’d work of it”

        <p><a href="#fr61" name="fn61" id="fn61">61</a>. John Romney’s hostile attitude toward Hayley is frequently expressed in the <em>Memoirs</em>
 of 1830. However, there had been unpleasantness between them as early 
as 1799, when the painter’s son demanded that Hayley redeem £1500 worth 
of stocks. See Victor Chan, “Pictorial Image and Social Reality: George 
Romney’s Late Drawings of John Howard Visiting Prisoners,” diss., 
Stanford University, 1983, 26. I thank Ted Andersson for providing me 
with a photocopy of the relevant pages of this dissertation.</p>
        <p>On 22 Aug. 1803 John Romney wrote to Thomas Greene about the 
£15 allowed to Hayley by George Romney’s executors. “Mr. Hayley insults 
my father’s memory by saying it is no more than a just return for his 
signal services. What signal services? for leading him by his bad 
example and evil counsels into those fatal errors which marked with 
misfortune and calamity the latter period of his life. Happy would he 
have been had he never known Mr. Hayley.” See Hilda Gamlin, <em>George Romney and His Art</em>
 (London: Swan Sonnenschein, 1894) 312-14. In 1804 Blake thought that 
some misunderstanding between the two had been ironed out, as shown in 
his letter to Hayley of 16 Mar. (E 743-44), and John Romney did help 
Hayley to the extent of permitting him to reproduce <em>Newton with the Prism</em> and <em>The Shipwreck</em>, and giving him <em>The Shipwreck </em>as a present.</p>

been intensified if, as Crosby and Essick suggest (71), he saw a 
large-paper copy of Hayley’s <em>Life</em> that had printed on its spine “HAYLEY’S / LIFE / OF / ROMNEY / Illustrated / WITH / TWELVE PLATES / BY / <em>CAROLINE WATSON</em>.”</p>

indentures were canceled after little more than two years when Steele 
decided to relocate. See <em>Four Kendal Portrait Painters</em> (Kendal: Abbot Hall Art Gallery, 1973) 4-7.</p>
