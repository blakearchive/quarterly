	<meta name="DC.Description" xml:lang="en" content=" For me, one of the most important discoveries of 2011 was   Google Scholar  , which allows searches in scholarly periodicals and books. Under &amp;ldquo;Blake&amp;rdquo; for 2009&amp;ndash;11 there were 48,400 entries in early November 2011, which effectively frightened me off. But I did plough through 5,950 entries under &amp;ldquo;William Blake&amp;rdquo; for 2009&amp;ndash;11, or rather I tried to do so, but (somewhat to my relief) I was only allowed to see the first thousand.  The information is often not comprehensive, omitting pagination and sometimes even author (in which case I have had to ignore it). Entries in other scripts such as Arabic and Chinese and Greek and Hebrew and Japanese and Korean may be incompletely metamorphosed into English or any other European language or script, and the titles may be translated, but they are never transliterated.  But  Google Scholar  does provide wonderfully broad coverage, and a very substantial number of entries here derive from it.   An online resource which is new to me is   Newspaper Archive  , which advertises 120,000,000 articles and is indeed very capacious and rewarding. ">

    <p class="subtitle" style="padding-top:10px"><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>Blake Publications and Discoveries in 2011</p>
    <p>For me, one of the most important discoveries of 2011 was <a href="http://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank"><em>Google Scholar</em></a>,
 which allows searches in scholarly periodicals and books. Under “Blake”
 for 2009–11 there were 48,400 entries in early November 2011, which 
effectively frightened me off. But I did plough through 5,950 entries 
under “William Blake” for 2009–11, or rather I tried to do so, but 
(somewhat to my relief) I was only allowed to see the first thousand.<br>
 The information is often not comprehensive, omitting pagination and 
sometimes even author (in which case I have had to ignore it). Entries 
in other scripts such as Arabic and Chinese and Greek and Hebrew and 
Japanese and Korean may be incompletely metamorphosed into English or 
any other European language or script, and the titles may be translated,
 but they are never transliterated.<br> But <em>Google Scholar</em> does provide wonderfully broad coverage, and a very substantial number of entries here derive from it.</p>
    <p>An online resource which is new to me is <a href="http://newspaperarchive.com/" target="_blank"><em>Newspaper Archive</em></a>, which advertises 120,000,000 articles and is indeed very capacious and rewarding.</p>

    <p>There was a scattering of new references to Blake in works 
published before Gilchrist opened the floodgates in 1863. These were in 
1798 (see <a href="#Young">Young</a> in Part III), 1800 (<a href="#Sculpture">Hayley, <em>Essay on Sculpture</em></a>, in Part III; <a href="#Tilloch">Tilloch</a> in Part VI), 1801 (<a href="#Hartley">Hartley</a> in Part III), 1818 (<a href="#Forged">Anon., “Forged Bank-Notes,”</a> in Part VI), 1843 (<a href="#1843">“The Chimney Sweeper”</a> in Part IB), 1845 (<a href="#Saunders">Saunders</a> in Part VI), 1846 (<a href="#1846">1846</a> in Part IV), 1847, 1848, 1853 (<a href="#Lester">Lester</a> in Part VI), 1853 (<a href="#Coleridge">John Duke Coleridge</a> in Part VI), 1856 (<a href="#Arvine">Arvine</a> and <a href="#Stephens">Stephens</a> in Part VI), 1857 (<a href="#Symington">Symington</a> in Part VI), 1860 (<a href="#1860">1860</a> in Part IB) and 1861 (<a href="#Gilchrist">Gilchrist</a>
 in Part VI). Perhaps the most interesting are those of 1800 and 1818 
about Blake’s connection with Tilloch’s attempt to suppress forgery of 
bank notes and the newly recorded advertisements of 1798 for Young’s <em>Night Thoughts</em>.</p>

 Note that the sudden surge of Chinese publications about Blake (Wei 
Lian Bu Lai Ke) does not mean that in 2011 there were suddenly more 
publications in Chinese than previously. It means that suddenly I have 
discovered how to find them. Most of the essays in Chinese are 
remarkably brief; twenty-six of them are only one or two pages. It is 
worth bearing in mind two factors about this brevity. In the first 
place, Chinese writing, in which one character represents a whole word, 
is far more concise than alphabetical writing, in which, for example, 
“alphabetical” requires twelve characters. In Chinese, a 5,000-word 
essay would require only three pages. And in the second place, 
candidates for the MA (a three-year degree) must publish two articles to
 qualify for the degree, though the quality of the essay and journal may
 be very modest.<br> <span class="notecall">More than one entry is in Arabic, which I cannot read.</span><span class="sidenote">E.g., author illegible to me, “[Utopia or Labyrinth of Reason?

    <p class="gapleft">Web Sites on Blake</p>

 (not many). Some sites never change, and some change frequently. In 
2011 web sites devoted exclusively or significantly to Blake included:</p>

    </div>
    <p class="gapleft">Blake’s Writings</p>
    <p>Two prints from <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> (o) have been newly recorded in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the first known loose print (pl. 15) from <em>For Children: The Gates of Paradise</em> was offered for sale. How extraordinary that new copies of Blake prints should still turn up.</p>
    <p>Untraced letters from Blake and to him have been newly identified
 below. Alas, the possibility of actually finding any of these letters 
is extraordinarily slight.</p>
    <p>Printings of single poems by Blake in 1843 and 1860 are newly recorded here.</p>
    <p>By far the most exciting newly recorded copy of a literary work by Blake is <em>Poetical Sketches</em>
 (Y). It had not been recorded at all until it was offered for sale in 
2011 and acquired by Robert N. Essick. It bears manuscript corrections 
by Blake like those in other copies distributed by or for him, and they 
are identical to those in copy S sent by John Flaxman to William Hayley 
in April 1784. The recipient was apparently John Hawkins, Blake’s early 
admirer—the handwriting on the title page is his. He seems to have 
acquired his copy very soon after the book was printed in 1783, for the 
address he wrote on it (“at M<sup>r</sup> Taylors Green St. Leicester 
fields”) was one where Blake lived only in 1782-84. Hawkins commissioned
 drawings from Blake, but this is the only Blake work he is known to 
have owned. This copy of <em>Poetical Sketches</em> helps to illuminate the most obscure period of Blake’s creative life.</p>
    <p><em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>, edited with an 
introduction and commentary by Michael Phillips (2011), is an important 
edition, generously illustrated with 169 reproductions, including 
colored prints of copies B, K, and M. These reproductions make it 
particularly valuable. They are accompanied by a long, detailed, and 
careful study of the <em>Marriage</em>, generously supported by useful 
information in the notes.  The study often seems to be designed to 
correct, not very effectively in my view, the arguments about dates of 
composition, etching, and printing in Joseph Viscomi, <em>Blake and the Idea of the Book</em> (1993).</p>
    <p class="gapleft">Commercial Engravings</p>
      <p>There are ambitious if uncertainly successful essays here on the costs of Hayley’s <em>Designs to a Series of Ballads</em> (1802) and the hypothetical costs of colored copies of Young’s <em>Night Thoughts</em> (1797).</p>
    <p class="gapleft">Catalogues and Bibliographies</p>
      <p>The most remarkable new catalogues were John Windle’s gorgeous <em>Omnium Gatherum</em> (2011) and <em>Pictorial Blake</em> (2011), the latter in particular with an impressive number of single prints from Blake’s commercial book engravings.</p>
    <p class="gapleft">Criticism, Biography, and Scholarship</p>
      <p>The most prolific performer in 2011 has been Paul Miner, who 
published twenty essays in the year, mostly about allusions in Blake’s 
works. His first publication on Blake of which I have record was 
fifty-four years ago, in 1958, and between then and 2010 he published at
 least twenty-six more essays on Blake. This prodigious fecundity is the
 more remarkable because he has not had the leisure and resources of an 
academic, and his hometown of Ponca City, Oklahoma, is not known for its
 library riches.<br>
      One of the most remarkable Blake publications of 2011 was the special issue of the <em>University of Toronto Quarterly</em> (fall 2011), edited by Karen Mulhallen. This was phase five of the William Blake Project. The previous phases were (1) <em>Blake in Our Time: Essays in Honour of G. E. Bentley Jr</em>,
 edited by Mulhallen (2010); (2) the symposium Blake in Our Time: A 
Symposium Celebrating the Future of Blake Studies and the Legacy of G. 
E. Bentley Jr (2010), orchestrated by Mulhallen; (3) the symposium 
exhibition (2010); and (4) the catalogue of it called <em>Remember Me! 
Blake in Our Time: A Keepsake Book in Celebration of an Exhibition and 
Symposium on the Life and Art of William Blake (1757-1827)</em> (2010). This is a very impressive panoply of scholarship and a wonderful credit to Mulhallen.</p>
    <p class="reviewheading">Biography</p>
      <p>Some of the best and most durable work today is being done on 
Blake’s biographical context. An example of this is Dennis M. Read, <em>R. H. Cromek, Engraver, Editor, and Entrepreneur</em>
 (2011). The factual part of the book, derived largely from six of his 
previously published essays, provides a sympathetic and reliable 
portrait of Cromek as a traveling salesman. Read’s benevolent 
conclusions as to Cromek’s amiability and reliability are a good deal 
more generous than those of most students of Blake will be, even after 
they have read and admired the book.<br>
      Angus Whitehead, “‘I write in South Molton Street, what I both <em>see</em> and <em>hear</em>’: Reconstructing William and Catherine Blake’s Residence and Studio at 17 South Molton Street, Oxford Street,” <em>British Art Journal</em>
 (2010), is original, richly detailed, and valuable. His “‘humble but 
respectable’: Recovering the Neighbourhood Surrounding William and 
Catherine Blake’s Last Residence, No. 3 Fountain Court, Strand, c. 
1820-27,” <em>University of Toronto Quarterly</em> (2011), has copious 
information about Blake’s neighbors, particularly about periods of 
residence in Fountain Court, professions, and ages, whilst his 
extraordinarily detailed essay “‘an excellent saleswoman’: The Last 
Years of Catherine Blake,” <em>Blake</em> (2011-12), provides crucial new evidence on where Catherine lived and when, and about Frederick Tatham and his young wife.<br>
      Mary Lynn Johnson, “‘Catalogue of Some of Blake’s Pictures at “The
 Salterns”’: Captain Butts as Exhibitor, Litigator, and Co-Heir (with 
His Sister Blanche),” <em>University of Toronto Quarterly</em> (2011), provides a great deal of information about the Blake heritage of the Butts family about 1850-1905.</p>
    <p class="reviewheading">Engravings</p>
      <p>Minute portions of Blake’s career as an engraver are dealt with
 in several new works. Wayne C. Ripley, “‘In Great Forwardness’?: 1798 
Advertisements for Volume Two of William Blake’s <em>Night Thoughts</em>,” <em>Notes and Queries</em>
 (2011), gives valuable new details about Blake’s most ambitious 
engraving commission. Mark Crosby, “Blake and the Banknote Crises of 
1797, 1800, and 1818,” <em>University of Toronto Quarterly</em> (2011), 
is concerned with the context of Blake’s support of Alexander Tilloch’s 
effort to produce forgery-proof bank notes. G. E. Bentley, Jr., “<em>Remember Me!</em> Customs and Costumes of Blake’s Gift Book,” <em>University of Toronto Quarterly</em> (2011), deals with the variety of binding decorations in <em>Remember Me!</em> and suggests a reason for the modesty of its sales.</p>
    <p class="reviewheading">Bibliography</p>
      <p>A considerable addition to the record in English of works on 
Blake in Japan is provided by the admirable and apparently exhaustive 
essay by Hikari Sato, “Meiji Taisho kino William Blake Shoshi Gakusha 
tachi—Yanagi Muneyoshi, Jugaku Bunsho, Sangu Makoto: William Blake 
Bibliographers in Japan in the 1910s and the 1920s—YANAGI Muneyoshi, 
JUGAKU Bunsho, and SANGU Makoto,” <em>Choiki Bunka Kagaku Kiyo: Interdisciplinary Cultural Studies</em> (2011).</p>
    <p class="reviewheading">Theology</p>
      <p>Christopher Rowland, <em>Blake and the Bible</em> (2011), is a careful and learned account of Blake in a theological context.</p>
    <p class="reviewheading">Interpretation</p>
      <p>Susanne M. Sklar, <em>Blake’s</em> Jerusalem <em>as Visionary Theatre: Entering the Divine Body</em>
 (2011), argues that “Blake’s tantalizing words become comprehensible 
when they are heard” (147). The thesis is argued in a different context 
in her “‘In the Mouth of a True Orator’ (<em>Jerusalem</em>’s Operating Instructions),” <em>University of Toronto Quarterly</em> (2011).</p>
    <p class="gapcenter">* * * * * * * * *</p>
    <p>The annual checklist of scholarship and discoveries concerning 
William Blake and his circle records publications and discoveries for 
the current year (say, 2011) and those for previous years which are not 
recorded in <em>Blake Books</em>, <em>Blake Books Supplement</em>, and “William Blake and His Circle.” Installments of “William Blake and His Circle” are continuations of <em>Blake Books</em> and <em>Blake Books Supplement</em>, with similar principles and conventions.</p>

    <p><span class="notecall">I take <em>Blake Books</em> and <em>Blake Books Supplement</em>, faute de mieux, to be the standard bibliographical books on Blake,</span><span class="sidenote">Except for the states of the prints for Blake’s commercial book engravings, where the standard authority is Robert N. Essick, <em>William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations</em>
 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991). Significant further details, 
especially about collations, are given in Roger R. Easson and Essick, <em>William Blake Book Illustrator: A Bibliography and Catalogue of the Commercial Engravings</em>,
 vol. 1: Plates Designed and Engraved by Blake (Normal: American Blake 
Foundation, 1972); vol. 2: Plates Designed or Engraved by Blake 
1774-1796 (Memphis: American Blake Foundation, 1979); vol. 3 never 
appeared. The standard authority for Blake prints issued separately is 
Essick, <em>The Separate Plates of William Blake: A Catalogue</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983).</span> and have noted significant differences from them.<br>
      The organization of Division I of the checklist is as in <em>Blake Books</em>.
 In Part VI: Criticism, Biography, and Scholarly Studies, collections of
 essays on Blake are listed under the names of the editors, and issues 
of periodicals devoted extensively to him are listed under the titles. 
Reviews, listed here under the book reviewed, are only for works which 
are chiefly about Blake, not for those with only, say, a chapter on 
Blake. Note that <em>Blake Books</em> and <em>Blake Books Supplement</em> normally do not include reviews.<br>
      Division II: Blake’s Circle is organized by individual (say, 
William Hayley or John Flaxman), with works by and about Blake’s friends
 and patrons, living individuals with whom he had significant direct and
 demonstrable contact. It does not include important contemporaries with
 whom Blake’s contact was negligible or nonexistent, such as John 
Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke. There is nothing in <em>Blake Books</em> and <em>Blake Books Supplement</em> corresponding to Division II.</p>
    <p>Research for this checklist was carried out particularly in the 
libraries of the University of Toronto and Victoria University in the 
University of Toronto, as well as with the electronic resources of <a href="http://copac.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><em>Copac</em></a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/" target="_blank"><em>Google Books</em></a>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank"><em>Google Scholar</em></a>, and <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/" target="_blank"><em>WorldCat</em></a>.

the National Diet Library. For publications in China, works were found

  <p class="desc">Blake repeatedly referred to money received or parcels

which you will be so kind as to send or give him.”</p>
  <p class="gapleftnormal"><em>1803 Jan.</em> from James Blake</p>

    <p class="desc">“Mr. Johnson has, at times, written such letters to 
me as would have called for the sceptre of Agamemnon rather than the 
tongue of Ulysses” (Blake’s letter to Hayley of 28 May 1804). The dates 
of Johnson’s letters could be any time from 1779 to May 1804.</p>

  <p class="gapcenter"><a name="Pickering" id="Pickering"></a>“Pickering [Ballads] Manuscript” (?after 1807)</p>
  Paper: The Pickering Manuscript p. 16 has a printed catchword (“With”) from Hayley’s <em>Designs to a Series of Ballads</em> (1802) p. 20 (E3<sup>v</sup>) &lt;﻿<em>BB</em> p. 341n2﻿&gt;. <span class="notecall">Therefore the 22 pages of the Pickering Manuscript probably came from <em>Designs</em> ballad 1, pp. 5-10 (B2<sup>r</sup>-B4<sup>v</sup>) and ballad 2, pp. 11-26 (D1<sup>r</sup>-E4<sup>v</sup>).</span><span class="sidenote">The paper in the Pickering Manuscript is uniform, but it is only an hypothesis that it all comes from Hayley’s <em>Designs to a Series of Ballads</em> and that the leaves are in the same order as in the <em>Designs</em>.  The paper comes from the inner margins of conjugate unfolded sheets with the text cut away.</span> The <em>Designs</em> paper sometimes shows a watermark of “1802.”<br>
  Paper size: 12.5 x 18.4 cm. &lt;﻿<em>BB</em> p. 342﻿&gt;. Since the leaves from Hayley’s <em>Designs</em> are 23.5 x 29.4 cm., therefore 11 cm. were trimmed from each dimension of the <em>Designs</em>
 leaves to make the Pickering Manuscript leaves. The outer margins were 
trimmed to remove irrelevant printed text, but why were 11 cm. cut off 
the tops or bottoms?<br>
  Binding: The leaves have stabholes in the inner margins 3.9 cm. from the top and 4.5, 4.6 cm. apart &lt;﻿<em>BB</em> p. 342﻿&gt;. If they had been stabbed when they were part of <em>Designs to a Series of Ballads</em>, one might expect to find two sets of stabholes, the first from when they were part of Hayley’s <em>Designs</em> and the second from when they became part of the Pickering Manuscript. The absence of duplicate stabholes suggests that the <em>Designs</em> leaves were loose when they were converted to the Pickering Manuscript.<br>

  History: The “C. Newman Born July 21st 1804,” as recorded on the 
leather label, is Charles Newman, son of Joseph and Ann Newman, who was 
born on 21 July and baptized at St. Martin-in-the-Fields on 12 Aug. 
1804, and Charles R. Robson, who acquired <em>Innocence</em> (E) “at 
Leicester in or about the year 1899” and sold it at Sotheby’s, 15 Dec. 
1926, is probably Charles Raynor Robson (1869-1947), schoolmaster of 
Leicester and cricketer, as I am told by Stephen Massil.

 was director of the Weyhe Gallery until 1940, when he became curator of
 prints at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Several of the prints in <em>Songs</em> (o) came from Weyhe.</span> and given by him in 1975 to the <span class="notecall">Philadelphia Museum of Art.</span><span class="sidenote">They
 were not in the catalogue when I inquired in 1962, 1977, and 1980. The 
museum identification codes for pls. 28, 52 are 1975-226-19 [and 18]. 
Their rediscovery was made by Joseph Viscomi, who told me of them. Most 
of my information comes from the generosity of Shelley Langdale of the 
museum.</span><br>

  <p class="desc">Blake wrote to Thomas Butts on 22 Sept. 1800, “My Sister will ... bring with her your account,” but no such account is known.</p>
  <p class="gapcenter">Account (1802)</p>
  <p class="desc">On 22 Nov. 1802 Blake wrote to Butts, “I have inclosed
 the Account of Money recievd &amp; work done,” but no such account is 
known.</p>
  <p class="gapcenter">Account book (1804)</p>

  <p class="gapcenter">Canterbury Pilgrims subscription (1806)</p>
  <p class="desc">According to Gilchrist, <em>Life of William Blake, “Pictor Ignotus”</em> (1863) 1: 204, “a subscription paper for an engraving of the <em>Canterbury Pilgrims</em> had been circulated by Blake’s friends ... in 1806, two years before publication of <em>The Grave</em>
 [1808].” No other reference to this “subscription paper” is known. It 
must have been compiled either by Blake or from his information. The 
subscription paper cannot be “Blake’s Chaucer: The Canterbury Pilgrims” 
(“<em>May</em> 15<em>th</em> 1809”) or “Blake’s Chaucer: An Original Engraving” <span class="notecall">(n.d., watermark 1810),</span><span class="sidenote">Copies of each belonged to Gilchrist’s son.</span> which silently quote from the <em>Descriptive Catalogue</em>
 (1809). The date is important, for it seems to demonstrate that Blake’s
 plan to engrave the Canterbury Pilgrims decisively preceded that of his
 rival Stothard.</p>
  <p class="gapcenter">Ticket of admission to Blake’s exhibition of 1809-10</p>
  <p class="desc">The only evidence for the existence of the ticket is 
in the postscript to Blake’s letter of May 1809 to Ozias Humphry: “I 
inclose a ticket of admission if you should honour my Exhibition with a 
Visit.”</p>

  <p class="desc">In addition, there are 6 leaves (1½ quarto sheets) 
with full-page prints for preliminaries (1 print) and ballad 1 (1), 
ballad 2 (1), ballad 3 (1), and ballad 4 (2). Each complete set of the <em>Designs</em>, all four parts, used 43 leaves, 10¾ quarto sheets.</p>
  <p class="desc">The text must have been printed by Seagrave in four 
print runs, one in late May 1802 for the preliminaries and ballad 1, one
 in late June for ballad 2, one in late July for ballad 3, and one in 
early September for ballad 4. The engravings, however, were only printed
 as they were called for.</p>
  <p class="desc">For paper for the full-page prints in the <em>Designs</em>,
 “Blake has ... [arranged] for his Ballads to deal with his own 
stationer in London, &amp; send it down as He thought proper,” according
 to Hayley’s letter of 6 July 1802.</p>
  <p class="desc">We do not know how many copies of the <em>Designs</em>
 were printed or what Seagrave’s charges were for printing and paper, 
but we may make educated estimates based on Blake’s statement in his 
letter of 28 Dec. 1804 that he paid Seagrave <span class="notecall">“30 Pounds ... in part of his Account”</span><span class="sidenote">Hayley wrote on 3 Apr. 1803 that Blake “has paid a Bill of 30£ for paper” [and printing] for the <em>Designs</em>.</span> and on contemporary printing prices. <a name="Bensley" id="Bensley"></a><span class="notecall">On 10 Oct. 1800 Thomas Bensley estimated that the cost of paper, printing, and hot-pressing 1,000 quarto copies of Thomson’s <em>Seasons</em> (5 sheets each) for F. J. Du Roveray would be £15.15.0 per sheet (£78.15 in all).</span><span class="sidenote">Quoted
 from the manuscript in the Huntington Library; see G. E. Bentley, Jr., 
“F. J. Du Roveray, Illustrated-Book Publisher 1798-1806: The Amateur and
 the Trade,” <em>Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin</em> 12 (1988): 70.</span> Perhaps Blake’s provincial printer Seagrave charged him £15 for paper and printing per thousand quarto sheets.</p>
  <p class="desc">It is a mere informed guess that the print run for 
ballad 1 was 250 copies and that this was continued for ballad 2 when 
the sales for ballad 1 at first seemed promising. When the sales for 
ballad 2 proved disastrous, Blake must have reduced his print order, 
perhaps to 150 copies, for ballads 3-4. The expenses of printing and 
paper might have been as follows:</p>

  <div class="footnotes"><a href="#fra4" name="fna4" id="fna4">a</a>. The medium plate paper for Flaxman’s <em>Iliad</em> (1805) cost £4.8.0 per ream in 1805 and £5 in 1808 (<em>BB</em>
 pp. 561-62). The cheap blue paper for the covers (400 sheets for 
ballads 1-2, 200 sheets for ballads 3-4) would have cost a good deal 
less than the fine white paper.</div> 
  <p class="desc">Presumably Seagrave printed copies of each ballad in 
Chichester and sent them to Blake in Felpham; Blake and his wife then 
printed engravings on text plates plus the full-page plates as the need 
arose, not all at once. <span class="notecall">Hayley wrote to Lady 
Hesketh on 10 June 1802, “He &amp; his excellent Wife (a true Helpmate!)
 pass the plates thro’ a rolling press in their own cottage together; 
&amp; of course it is a work of some Time to collect a Number of 
Impressions.”</span><span class="sidenote">Hayley repeats this in his 
letter to R. H. Evans on 3 April 1803: “He and his good industrious Wife
 together take all the Impressions from the various Engravings in their 
own domestic Press.”</span></p>
  <p class="desc">When there proved to be demand for only a few score 
copies, Blake was left with many copies of the printed text which were 
of no commercial value. <span class="notecall">He cannily kept these 
printed sheets, even taking them back to London with him in 1803, at 
considerable trouble, and he made drawings on them for the rest of his 
life, including designs for Blair’s <em>Grave</em> (1805), Malkin’s <em>Memoirs</em> (1806), <em>Job</em> and Dante (c. 1824).</span><span class="sidenote"><em>BB</em> pp. 574-75 and <em>BBS</em> pp. 221-22 record 47 leaves from the <em>Designs</em> used as scrap paper (see also the <a href="#Pickering">“Pickering Manuscript”</a> in Part IA), but none for finished engravings. (The “Riddle Manuscript” is on the verso of a proof-before-letters from the <em>Designs</em>.)
 There are 9 leaves used as scrap from part 1, 24 from part 2, 8 from 
part 3, and 6 from part 4, which might suggest that part 2 provided most
 unvendible copies. A disproportionate number of scraps are on leaves 
which would have had prints on them: pp. 9 (5), 11 (1), 26 (6), 27 (1), 
41 (2). No print from the <em>Designs</em> is known to have been reused.</span>
  </p><p class="reviewheading">Sales</p>
  <p class="desc">The first reports of sales were encouraging. On 29 
June 1802 Hayley wrote that ballad 1 was “marching triumphantly on the 
road of prosperity,” and as late as 30 Jan. 1803 Blake wrote to his 
brother: “These Ballads are likely to be Profitable for we have Sold all
 that we have had time to print. Evans the Bookseller in Pallmall says 
they go off very well.”</p>
  <p class="desc">However, Hayley told R. H. Evans on 3 April 1803: “He 
has paid a Bill of 30£ for paper &amp; the copies He has disposed of in 
the country have not produced more than <span class="notecall">half that sum</span><span class="sidenote"><a name="34" id="34"></a>£15
 would have paid for 120 individual ballads at 2s. 6d. each. However, we
 know that Lady Hesketh paid £5.5.0 for 10 copies and Flaxman £1.17.6 
for 4, leaving only £7.17.6 (£15 - £7.2.6) or 63 copies.</span> to 
reimburse Him.” The £30 for Seagrave was apparently partly advanced by 
Hayley, for on 28 Dec. 1804 Blake thanked him for “the Twelve Guineas 
which you Lent Me when I made up 30 Pounds to pay our Worthy Seagrave in
 part of his Account.” Blake wrote on 26 Oct. 1803, “Mr. Evans ... gives
 small hopes of our ballads; he says he has sold but fifteen numbers at 
the most, and that going on would be a certain loss of almost all the 
expenses,” and on 22 Jan. 1805 he wrote that the London bookseller 
Phillips advised that “we must consider all that has been printed as 
lost, and begin anew.”</p>
  <p class="desc">The <em>Designs to a Series of Ballads</em> were 
printed by J. Seagrave in Chichester and sold by him and P. Humphry and 
R. H. Evans in London “for W. BLAKE, Felpham.” We do not know how many 
copies Seagrave sold—perhaps he only provided the copy for the reviewer 
in the <em>Sussex Chronicle &amp; Chichester Advertiser</em> (2 June 1802), which he printed—but we have good information about how many were sold by Evans in London <span class="notecall">(15, worth £1.17.6)</span><span class="sidenote">The
 sales by Evans included ballads 1-3 for Anna Seward and 3-4 for Lady 
Hesketh and some of her friends; Evans would have deducted his 
commission. We have no information about sales by Humphry.</span> and how many were disposed of by friends of Blake and Hayley <span class="notecall">(120, worth £15),</span><span class="sidenote">We
 can account for sales of 62 copies of ballad 1, 19 of ballad 2, 10 of 
ballad 3, and 12 of ballad 4 = 103 in all. Only 53 numbers have been 
traced today.</span> mostly in the country. </p>

  <p class="desc">Blake’s probable expenses for the <em>Designs</em> 
were therefore for paper and printing (£30.16.0), copper (£3.13.1½), and
 advertising (15s. for 6 review copies), or £35.4.1½ in all, and his 
probable receipts (£16.7.6) left him considerably out of pocket. 
Hayley’s generous gesture had been a disaster for Blake, not only in 
losing money but also in wasting his creative genius.</p>

  <p class="desc"><span class="notecall">R. Noble, the printer of <em>Night Thoughts</em>,
 was a jobbing printer—or perhaps two printers—whose residence was given
 as 4 Great Shire Lane, Temple Bar, in 1790, 1794-1800, and who 
registered press(es) at Green Arbour Court, Old Bailey, in 1799 and 
1800.</span><span class="sidenote">According to William B. Todd, <em>A Directory of Printers and Others in Allied Trades, London and Vicinity 1800-1840</em>
 (London: Printing Historical Society, 1972), Richard Noble, printer, of
 4 Great Shire Lane, Temple Bar, registered his press under the new law 
on 30 Aug. 1799 with Joseph Burt and again by himself on 17 Jan. 1800. 
Robert Noble, printer, resident at 4 Great Shire Lane, registered his 
press with Joseph Burt at Green Arbour Court, Old Bailey, on 16 Jan. 
1800. William Calvert, printer, of 4 Great Shire Lane, registered a 
press with James Calvert on 1 July 1801 and operated it in 1801-23. R. 
Noble was not apprenticed in the Stationers’ Company, according to <em>Stationers’ Company Apprentices 1701-1800</em>, ed. D. F. McKenzie (Oxford: Oxford Bibliographical Society, 1978).</span>
 I have traced his imprint on 55 editions printed in 1790-1804, mostly 
(36) in 1800-01; there were only 3 in 1796-98, and only one of the Noble
 editions was a folio, Young’s <em>Night Thoughts</em>. R. Noble was far
 from the achievement—and probably from the expense—of the great rivals 
of Richard Edwards, Thomas Bensley with Macklin’s great folio Bible 
(1800), and William Bulmer with the Boydells’ great folio Shakespeare 
(1791-1805) and Milton (1793-97).</p>

  <p class="desc">It would be agreeable to think that the Blakes were paid for printing the engravings.</p>
  <p class="reviewheading">Payments
  </p><p class="desc">The heaviest investor in the work was William Blake. He had asked £105 for his watercolors; <span class="notecall">instead he received £21 (9d. per design)</span><span class="sidenote">Joseph Farington’s diary, 24 June 1796 (<em>BR</em>[2] 71). Blake’s friend J. T. Smith called it a “despicably low ... price” (<em>Nollekens and His Times</em> [1828]; see <em>BR</em>[2] 610).</span>
 plus a ream of paper (£5.0.0). We do not know how much or even whether 
he was paid for his 43 folio engravings. At the very least he should 
have expected £5.5.0 each for these very large plates (c. 33 x 41 cm.), <span class="notecall">the sum he received for his smaller outline plates (c. 35 x 25 cm.) for Flaxman’s <em>Iliad</em> (1805) and Hesiod (1817),</span><span class="sidenote"><em>BB</em> pp. 561-62, 557-58. For his 12 highly finished, slightly smaller plates for Blair’s <em>Grave</em>, Schiavonetti was paid perhaps £540 (<em>BR</em>[2] 246); he asked £63 for “The Day of Judgment” (<em>BR</em>[2] 245).</span> a total of £225.15.0.</p>
  <p class="desc"><span class="notecall">It is possible that Blake was 
paid for his engravings not in cash but in copies of the book, valued at
 £5.5.0 for all four parts or £2.2.0 for part 1 (£1.1.0 deposit and 
£1.1.0 on delivery).</span><span class="sidenote">Prospectus, <em>BR</em>(2) 78-79. Colored copies are not mentioned in contemporary advertisements and reviews.</span> Blake could then color and sell them for his own profit. Perhaps he was given about 30 copies, worth £31. <span class="notecall">Twenty-eight colored copies have been traced.</span><span class="sidenote">Copies A-T are recorded in <em>BB</em> pp. 642-46, 956-57, copies U-Z in <em>BBS</em> pp. 272-73, and copies AA-BB in <em>Blake</em> (2000, 2002).</span>
 Some have contemporary inscriptions associating them with Blake: copy Q
 is annotated “This Copy was coloured for me by Mr Blake | W. E.”; copy R
 has “This copy col<sup><u>rd</u></sup> by W. Blake”; copy C is signed 
“W. Blake”; and copies C and W have notes that they were to serve “as 
pattern” for coloring, presumably by Mrs. Blake. A surprising number can
 be traced to contemporary owners, most of whom owned other works by 
Blake: [Rebekah] Bliss (d. 1819) (D), Thomas Butts (1757-1845) (A), 
Baron Dimsdale (1712-1800) (X), “W. E.” (for William Esdaile [1758-1837]
 or William Ensom [1796-1832]) (Q), ?Richard Edwards (1768-1827) (B), 
Thomas Gaisford (1779-1855) (G), John S. Harford, Jr. (1785-1866) (R), 
John Soane (1753-1837) (F), and Earl Spencer (1758-1834) (O).</p>
  <p class="desc">The <em>Night Thoughts</em> were colored in two 
styles, one about 1797 (C-D, I-J, Q-R, U), and the other about 1805 (B, 
H, L, P). Presumably this means that Blake carried copies with him when 
he moved from London to Felpham in 1800 and then back again when he 
returned to London in 1803.</p>
  <p class="desc">How much was he paid for these colored copies? We have
 no direct evidence, but we can find a comfortable analogy in the prices
 of colored copies of works in illuminated printing of the same size. 
Blake’s prospectus of 1793 lists uncolored copies of <em>America</em> with 18 folio plates at 10s. 6d. and <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> with 11 folio plates at 7s. 6d., while the prices for colored copies in his letter of 9 June 1818 are £5.5.0 (<em>America</em>) and £3.3.0 (<em>Visions</em>). Subtracting the prices of uncolored copies from those for colored copies indicates that the price for coloring <em>America</em> was 5s. 3d. per plate and <em>Visions</em> 5s. ½d. per plate. <span class="notecall">If Blake calculated 5s. for coloring each of the 43 folio prints in <em>Night Thoughts</em>, he would have charged ten guineas per copy.</span><span class="sidenote">The printed text of <em>Night Thoughts</em> is thrown in gratis.<br>About 1797 Blake was paid £10.10.0 for his 116 watercolor designs to Gray (<em>BR</em>[2] 246).</span> Even with a more modest five guineas per copy, he would have received £157.10.0 for 30 copies. <span class="notecall">With this he seems to have been content.</span><span class="sidenote">When
 Blake complained of neglect by the great illustrated book publishers 
Boydell, Macklin, and Bowyer (Notebook p. 23), he did not mention 
Richard Edwards, the publisher of his <em>Night Thoughts</em>, perhaps implying that he did not feel that he had been mistreated by Edwards.</span></p>

1797, correct its “forty” engravings to “43,” and add eight new 
booksellers while omitting Richard Edwards. The author of the 
advertisements (James Edwards?) is notably more emphatic about Blake’s 
plates—a “masterly hand” which will “command the attention of the 
Literati, the Amateur of the Fine Arts, and of the Artist”—<span class="notecall">than
 the author (Richard Edwards?) of the “Advertisement” in the 1797 
edition, who conceived “it to be unnecessary to speak” of “the merit of 
Mr. Blake.”</span><span class="sidenote"><em>BR</em> (2) 78-79, 76.</span></p>
  <p class="reviewheading">Did Richard Edwards Publish the <em>Night Thoughts</em>?</p>
  <p class="desc">Richard Edwards was identified as the publisher in 
Farington’s diary (24 June 1796), in the prospectus (?spring 1797), 
along with James Edwards and Robert Bowyer, and on the title page 
(1797). However, the advertisements in the <em>True Briton</em> (March 1798) and the <em>Times</em>
 (July 1798) omit him and instead name James Edwards, Robson, Faulder, 
Payne, White, Robinsons, Clarke, Bell, and Harding, whilst the notice in
 the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> (June 1798) names only Robson.</p>
  <p class="desc"><span class="notecall">For some time Richard Edwards had been withdrawing from business;</span><span class="sidenote">See G. E. Bentley, Jr., <em>The
 Edwardses of Halifax: The Making and Selling of Beautiful Books in 
London and Halifax by William, John, Richard, Thomas, and Especially 
James Edwards, the Medician Bookseller</em> (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, forthcoming).</span> perhaps he did not publish <em>Night Thoughts</em> at all. <span class="notecall">The only known sale in 1797 is by his brother James on 6 November.</span><span class="sidenote"><em>BR</em>(2) 79.</span> After Richard Edwards withdrew from business, the <em>Night Thoughts</em> was taken over by a congery of booksellers headed by James Edwards, who advertised it in the <em>True Briton</em> and the <em>Times</em>. Then James Edwards too retired, and in 1798 James Robson took over the <em>Night Thoughts</em>.</p>
  <p class="desc">The work sold very slowly, in part because the publishers kept changing. <span class="notecall">In 1811 Crabb Robinson claimed that Blake’s edition of <em>Night Thoughts</em> “is no longer to be bought.”</span><span class="sidenote">[Crabb Robinson], <em>Vaterländisches Museum</em> (1811) (<em>BR</em>[2] 600). Robinson bought a copy on 27 Dec. 1810 (<em>BR</em>[2] 600fn).</span></p>
  <p class="desc">The commission for the <em>Night Thoughts</em> was due
 to the genius of Richard Edwards. He chose a fine, expensive paper 
(1794 | J WHATMAN) and a fine artist and engraver (William Blake). 
However, his claim in the integral advertisement that <span class="notecall">“he has shrunk from no expence”</span><span class="sidenote"><em>BR</em>(2) 76.</span> is plainly false. He allowed William Blake to bear the major part of the expense of the only volume that was published.</p>
  <p class="desc">And he scarcely published the work, or perhaps he did 
not publish it at all. He withdrew from business, apparently for 
personal reasons, just when the <em>Night Thoughts</em> was finished. Apparently he never advertised it in 1797 or sent out a review copy. The contemporary obscurity of Young’s <em>Night Thoughts</em> (1797) with Blake’s illustrations is significantly due to the commercial neglect of Richard Edwards.</p><br>

  Mark Crosby. “Blake and the Banknote Crises of 1797, 1800, and 1818.” 
815-36. (A densely factual account of the bank-note crisis of 1797 with a
 new testimonial document signed by Blake, plus unrecorded reuses of it 
in the new crises of 1800 and 1818.)<br>
  Susanne Sklar. “‘In the Mouth of a True Orator’ (<em>Jerusalem</em>’s Operating Instructions).” 837-57. (Persuasive arguments that <em>Jerusalem</em> “has been designed to be read aloud” and that the bellicose, ruthless “Hand” in <em>Jerusalem</em>
 is far more like the ruthless, bellicose General Charles Lennox, third 
Duke of Richmond [1735–1806], who was a magistrate at Blake’s trial for 
sedition [1804] and who, according to Hayley, was “bitterly prejudiced 
against Blake” [<em>BR</em>(2) 183], than he is like the pacific, humanitarian <span class="notecall">Leigh Hunt, who has been traditionally associated by scholars with Hand.)</span><span class="sidenote">Blake was attacked in the <em>Examiner</em> in 1808-09; he attacked the <em>Examiner</em> and the three Hunt brothers who conducted it in his Public Address (Notebook p. 52); there is a three-headed figure on <em>Jerusalem</em> pl. 50; three men with pointing hands on <em>Jerusalem</em> pl. 93 are associated with the accusers of Socrates; articles in the <em>Examiner</em> by the Hunts were often signed with a pointing hand.</span><br>
  Angus Whitehead. “‘humble but respectable’: Recovering the 
Neighbourhood Surrounding William and Catherine Blake’s Last Residence, 
No. 3 Fountain Court, Strand, c. 1820-27.” 858-79. (A dense record of 
who lived in Fountain Court when the Blakes did [1821-27], their ages, 
births, deaths, marriages, and, often, their occupations, though of 
course there is scarcely anything of their social intercourse.)<br>
  *G. E. Bentley, Jr. “<em>Remember Me!</em> Customs and Costumes of Blake’s Gift Book.” 880-92. (The 24 known copies of <em>Remember Me!</em>
 differ from one another in “the pattern of binding, colour of 
fore-edges, endpapers, and the decorated sleeve-case”; the “paucity of 
sales may be related to the fact that the publisher John Poole had 
little experience of book distribution. His speciality was as a maker of
 Marble Paper and Fancy Pocket-Books, not in selling them” [880].)<br>
  Mary Lynn Johnson. “‘Catalogue of Some of Blake’s Pictures at “The 
Salterns”’: Captain Butts as Exhibitor, Litigator, and Co-Heir (with His
 Sister Blanche).” 893-917. (A prolifically factual account of the Butts
 family and its Blake collections 1863-1905. The essay includes a 
transcription of the Salterns catalogue [1898] [914-15] and a “Butts 
Family Genealogical Chart” of “Descendants of Blake’s Patrons, Thomas 
&amp; Elizabeth Butts” [916-17].)<br>

 the cinematic technique of montage” [918].)<br>
