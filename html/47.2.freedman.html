<p class="title">Blake, Duncan, and the Politics of Writing from Myth</p>
<p class="byline">By Linda Freedman</p>
<p class="note"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Linda Freedman</span> (<a href="mailto:l.freedman@ucl.ac.uk">l.freedman@ucl.ac.uk</a>)
 is a lecturer in British and American literature at University College 
London. She is a graduate of Oxford and London and a former fellow of 
Selwyn College, Cambridge. She is the author of <em>Emily Dickinson and the Religious Imagination</em>
 (Cambridge University Press, 2011) and is currently writing a book 
about William Blake and America. She has a particular interest in 
transatlantic connections and in the relationship between literature, 
religion, and the visual arts.</p>
</div>
<div id="text">
<p class="strong" style="margin-top: 30px">Duncan’s Reading of Blake</p>
<p><span class="notecall">William Blake and the twentieth-century American poet Robert Duncan have a natural affinity.</span><span class="sidenote">For other essays and books detailing this affinity, see Robert J. Bertholf, “Robert Duncan: Blake’s Contemporary Voice,” <em>William Blake and the Moderns</em>, ed. Robert J. Bertholf and Annette S. Levitt (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1982) 92-110; David Annwn, <em>Hear
 the Voice of the Bard! Who Present, Past, &amp; Future Sees—Three Cores
 of Bardic Attention: The Early Bards, William Blake and Robert Duncan</em> (Hay-on-Wye: West House Books, 1995); Edward Larrissy, “Two American Disciples of Blake: Robert Duncan and Allen Ginsberg,” <em>Blake and Modern Literature</em>
 (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006) 108-24; and Jerome McGann, “Art
 and Error: With Special Reference to the Poetry of Robert Duncan,” <em>Modern Language Studies</em> 27.2 (spring 1997): 9-22.</span>
 Both were profoundly interested in the penetrative mobility between the
 temporal and the eternal. They also have an affinity as poets who used 
their mythopoeic forms to explore the ethical boundaries between self 
and other and to relate that exploration to the violent politics of 
their respective historical moments. <span class="notecall">For Duncan 
and his coterie, Blake was yoked with Whitman; they were old male bards 
of the prophetic tradition, mingling visionary poetics with homosexual 
and homosocial freedoms.</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan’s coterie was, by his own admission, a boys’ club. See Michael Davidson, <em>The San Francisco Renaissance: Poetics and Community at Mid-century</em> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989) 175-76.</span>
 This article argues that if we look at the way Duncan read Blake and we
 read both poets alongside each other, we arrive at a better 
understanding of the involvement of politics with hermetic vision.</p>
<p><span class="notecall">Influenced by Yeats and Ellis’s 
ground-breaking 1893 edition of Blake’s work and conditioned by his own 
occultist upbringing, Duncan read Blake as a poet of hermetic vision.</span><span class="sidenote"><em>The Works of William Blake: Poetic, Symbolic, and Critical</em>,
 ed. with lithographs of the illustrated “prophetic books,” and a memoir
 and interpretation by Edwin John Ellis and William Butler Yeats, 3 
vols. (London: Bernard Quaritch, 1893).</span> For Duncan, Blake sees 
clearly into the essential truth of his own time, and this insight 
carries a deep social responsibility. In <em>Roots and Branches</em> and <em>Fictive Certainties</em>,
 Duncan draws from his sense of an occult Blake to deepen his own 
exploration of the poetic textures of personal experience. In <em>Bending the Bow</em>,
 he takes his reading of Blake beyond the personal and poetic 
implications of occult mysticism toward an intensely ethical political 
engagement. This does not represent a rupture from the concerns 
expressed in <em>Roots and Branches</em> and <em>Fictive Certainties</em>,
 but a development. In both instances, Duncan comes into his creative 
potential thinking about Blake in terms of touch. The act of touching 
something, or someone, had a particular personal significance for him as
 a signifier of both intimacy and reality. At the age of three he was 
hurt in an accident in the snow and became cross-eyed so that he saw 
double. In <em>Roots and Branches</em> he spoke about the effects of his injury in metaphysical terms: “<span class="notecall">I
 had the double reminder always, the vertical and horizontal 
displacement in vision that later became separated, specialized into a 
near and a far sight. One image to the right and above the other. Reach 
out and touch. Point to the one that is really there.”</span><span class="sidenote">Robert Duncan, “A Sequence of Poems for H.D.’s Birthday, September 10, 1959. Finishd October 24, 1959,” <em>Roots and Branches</em> (New York: New Directions, 1964) 14.</span>
 Duncan implies that if we can touch something, we can verify its 
quiddity and its reality. It is reassuring to touch because it confirms a
 connection and dispels an illusion. Touch therefore becomes a way of 
envisioning the world and confirming the relationships that exist within
 it.
</p><p>So, Duncan started to think about the metaphysical significance 
of touch at a very early age. The ethical dimensions followed naturally 
from a sense of touch that had already become associated with vision. In
 his poetry, Duncan uses the extended conceit of touch and the 
provocations offered by the extremes of violence and tenderness in order
 to explore the ethical relationship between self and other and the 
interface between the personal, political, and poetic implications of 
that relationship. The intimacy of touch also becomes a way of imagining
 poetic influence and Blake’s impact on Duncan’s own sense of poetic 
identity. The extended conceit is vital to Duncan’s repeated return to 
the ethics of boundaries and boundary crossing. The metaphor works 
because it emphasizes boundary as a real and tangible distinction and 
because it offers ways of transgressing that distinction.</p>
<p>Duncan’s reading of Blake therefore suggests the discovery of a 
relevant and restorative romanticism with which to address the modern 
world. <span class="notecall">Kristin Prevallet has written that, for 
Duncan and his contemporaries in the San Francisco Bay Area, romantic 
identification provided a utopia; it helped form an imaginary community 
where they could live free from the intolerances of mainstream America.</span><span class="sidenote">Kristin Prevallet, “Introduction,” <em>A Helen Adam Reader</em>, ed. with notes and introduction by Kristin Prevallet (Orono, Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 2007) 19.</span> In the early 1950s Duncan started publishing in the <em>Black Mountain Review</em>
 and in 1956 he taught at Black Mountain College. Like Blake, Black 
Mountain’s founder, John Andrew Rice, thought everyone was born an 
artist but some were oppressed by the public world. Black Mountain was 
established in order to provide an escape where people could reassert 
their artistic nature. The central challenge facing Black Mountain poets
 was arguably to reinvent romantic poetics for contemporary American 
existence.</p>
<p><span class="notecall">Fed up with what he perceived as the narrowing of vision in the modern world to a “theater of the absurd,”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth,” <em>Fictive Certainties</em> (New York: New Directions, 1955) 5.</span>
 a stage where atomic disaster and the end of humanity were the only 
stories seen by the reasonable anti-mythopoeic mind, Duncan found hope 
in Blake. Duncan claimed that</p><blockquote><span class="notecall">in England, the divine Blake broke through the confines of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century rationalist poetics with his <em>Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>,
 blasting that model of self-righteous and reasonable men, the Deist, 
and howling against the first factories and machineries of his own day’s
 versions of what [Rudolf] Bultmann considers to be the modern 
scientific man for whom: “it is impossible to use electric light and the
 wireless and to avail ourselves of modern medical and surgical 
discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world 
of spirits and miracles.”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 27-28.</span></blockquote>
Blake appealed to Duncan because he seemed to be both of this world and another.
<p>Recalling his introduction to Blake by the poet Helen Adam, Duncan commented: <span class="notecall">“I
 was already a convert to the Romantic spirit, and myth in that spirit 
is not only a story that expresses the soul but a story that awakens the
 soul to the real persons of its romance, in which the actual and the 
spiritual are revealed, one in the other.”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 31.</span> <span class="notecall">As
 Robert Bertholf has argued, Adam’s reading of Blake in Duncan’s poetry 
seminar proved an important turning point for Duncan, at least partly 
because it came at a moment when he was thinking about Charles Olson’s 
essay on “Projective Verse.”</span><span class="sidenote">Bertholf 99.</span> Adam had brought the “Introduction” to Blake’s <em>Songs of Experience</em> as an example of great poetry to a class that Duncan ran at Black Mountain. The poem begins:
</p><blockquote>Hear the voice of the Bard!<br>
Who Present, Past, &amp; Future sees<br>
Whose ears have heard,<br>
The Holy Word,<br>
<span class="notecall">That walk’d among the ancient trees.</span><span class="sidenote">William Blake, “Introduction,” pl. 30, <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>, ed. with introduction and notes by Andrew Lincoln (Princeton: Princeton University Press/William Blake Trust, 1991).</span></blockquote>
It chimed remarkably well with Olson’s statements about contemporary poetics. Olson claimed: <span class="notecall">“Verse now, 1950, if it is to go ahead, if it is to be of <em>essential</em>
 use, must, I take it, catch up and put into itself certain laws and 
possibilities of the breath, of the breathing of the man who writes as 
well as of his listenings.”</span><span class="sidenote">Charles Olson, <em>Projective Verse</em> (New York: Totem Press, 1959) 3.</span>
 Duncan must have heard the echo of Olson’s poetic definitions 
reverberating in Blake’s call to hear the prophet-artist, whose 
particular quality of inspiration (“breath” or “breathing”) arises out 
of his privileged position as listener. And the awakening that Duncan 
describes is also very much in tune with Olson’s question: “What stance 
toward reality brings such [projective] verse into being[?]” Olson 
argues that the degree to which the projective involves a stance toward 
the reality outside the poem as well as a new stance toward the reality 
of a poem itself is a matter of content. He writes:
<blockquote>If the beginning and the end is breath, voice in its largest
 sense, then the material of verse shifts. It has to. It starts with the
 composer. The dimension of his line itself changes, not to speak of the
 change in his conceiving, of the matter he will turn to, of the scale 
in which he imagines that matter’s use. … What seems to me a more valid 
formulation for present use is “objectism,” a word to be taken to stand 
for the kind of relation of man to experience which a poet might state 
as the necessity of a line or a work to be as wood is, to be as clean as
 wood is as it issues from the hand of nature, to be as shaped as wood 
can be when a man has had his hand to it. Objectism is the getting rid 
of the lyrical interference of the individual as ego, of the “subject” 
and his soul …. For a man is himself an object …. <span class="notecall">If
 he stays inside himself, if he is contained within his nature as he is 
participant in the larger force, he will be able to listen, and his 
hearing through himself will give him secrets objects share.</span><span class="sidenote">Olson 10-11.</span></blockquote>
<p><span class="notecall">The two-way revelation between the “actual” and the “spiritual”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 31.</span>
 that Duncan describes as pertinent to his appreciation of Blake is 
present in Olson’s conclusions about the poetic function. In the 
attention he pays to the reality outside the poem, the field of 
composition, Olson blurs the distinction between spiritual and actual 
existence, imagining them, as Duncan does, in dialogue with each other. 
The simile he uses to describe the relation of man to experience is 
drawn from the natural world and suggests an intimacy with the actual. 
But Olson’s subsequent claim that “[man] is contained within his nature 
as he is participant in the larger force” imbues the natural or actual 
with a sense of the cosmic. In the end Olson arrives at a poetic ideal 
that resonates deeply with Blake’s prophet-artist: “his hearing through 
himself will give him secrets objects share.” It is important that 
Duncan was thinking about Olson’s essay when he was introduced to Blake,
 not only because of the emphasis that Olson places on the interplay 
between the aural and the oral, but also because of the attention he 
gives to the place of the actual in visionary poetics.</p>
<p>If Duncan’s response to Blake was heavily conditioned by his reading 
of Olson, it was also typically American in aligning Blake with Walt 
Whitman. <span class="notecall">In 1868 Algernon Charles Swinburne had 
claimed that “the points of contact and sides of likeness between 
William Blake and Walt Whitman are so many and so grave, as to afford 
some ground of reason to those who preach the transition of souls or 
transfusion of spirits,” and the comparison was taken up 
enthusiastically by readers on both sides of the Atlantic.</span><span class="sidenote">Algernon Charles Swinburne, <em>William Blake: A Critical Essay</em>
 (1868; London: Heinemann, 1925) 300-01. For more on the connection 
between Blake and Whitman, including Whitman’s own ambivalent reaction 
to it, see Linda Freedman, “Walt Whitman and William Blake: The 
Prophet-Artist and Democratic Thought,” <em>Transatlantic Traffic and (Mis)Translations</em>, ed. Robin Peel and Daniel Maudlin (Durham, New Hampshire: University of New Hampshire Press, 2013) 133-55.</span> Duncan continues the association between Blake and Whitman. In his essay on Whitman, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><span class="notecall">Taking his Self and his Law, Poetics 
and Politics, not in the architecture of an Other World, but in an 
identification with the creative forces working within masses and 
populations, the poet was to work toward the Wedding of the Ideal and 
the Actual, even as Blake had proposed a poetic marriage of Heaven and 
Hell in the Actual. Whitman saw within the actuality of These States the
 idea of an America latent and at work. Not a poetry commemorative of an
 established order or a poetry striving to perfect an order out of 
chaos, but a poetry creative “in the region of imaginative, spinal and 
essential attributes, something equivalent to creation … imperatively 
demanded.”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “Changing Perspectives in Reading Whitman,” <em>Fictive Certainties</em> 166-67.</span></blockquote>
<p>Duncan presents Whitman as the exemplary democratized prophetic 
voice, seeking an “identification with the creative forces working 
within masses and populations.” In doing so, he implicitly extends the 
principles of hermetic vision to the political sphere. As the eternal is
 realized within the temporal, the “creative forces” find their active 
and disruptive embodiment in the “masses and populations.” This passage 
shows the extent to which Duncan’s sense of Whitman was informed by his 
reading of Blake, and vice versa. It is from Blake, read through Olson’s
 lens, that Duncan derives his understanding of the poetics of the 
polis. He was clearly aware of how deeply resonant the word “States” is 
for a reader of Blake. In the same essay he writes:
</p><blockquote><span class="notecall">Once we read the United States as
 belonging to the greatest poem, the race of all races, and we hear 
Whitman speaking of Americans throughout the population of Man—every 
place and any place and time of Man—then, underlying these United States
 and this America, comes a mystery of “America” that belongs to dream 
and desire and the reawakening of earliest oneness with all peoples—at 
last, the nation of Mankind at large. It is this that informs Whitman’s 
enthusiasm for America. In the language of Poetry, of “the greatest 
poem,” we rightly read him in the light of Blake’s visions of America, 
direful as they are, the States are seen by the poet as states of Man, 
and what is happening in the Revolution happens, in Blake’s world, not 
because the colonies are English but because they are colonies of Man. 
The drama he reads in his figures of fire and outrage and imprisonment 
and volcanic release is a drama “of all nations at any time upon the 
earth.”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “Changing Perspectives in Reading Whitman” 170-71.</span></blockquote>
<p>Taking his cue from Blake, Duncan uses the word “States” to describe 
the political and poetic character of America. “States” refers to the 
governmental organization of America, the Blakean contraries of “Heaven”
 and “Hell,” the Whitmanesque “Ideal” and “Actual,” and the states of 
Blake’s fourfold vision, which combines reason and imagination, sense 
and emotion. Duncan would also have known of Blake’s claim that <span class="notecall">“the Imagination is not a State: it is the Human Existence itself.”</span><span class="sidenote">William Blake, <em>Milton</em> pl. 32*, <em>Milton a Poem and the Final Illuminated Works</em>,
 ed. with introductions and notes by Robert N. Essick and Joseph Viscomi
 (Princeton: Princeton University Press/William Blake Trust, 1993).</span>
 His reference to “the actuality of These States” therefore exploits the
 Blakean resonance of changing vision. Whitman’s “Wedding,” like Blake’s
 <em>Marriage</em>, suggests tension and distance as well as mutual 
opening, exchange, and bond. Duncan’s philosophic commitment to the 
Blakean mantra “Without Contraries is no progression” gives an 
optimistic urgency to his reading of Whitman. It is no accident that 
Duncan returns insistently to the moment of touch. <span class="notecall">As for D. H. Lawrence, who called for a Whitmanesque “democracy of touch” in <em>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</em>, the moment of touch was always charged with political and ethical meaning.</span><span class="sidenote">D. H. Lawrence, <em>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</em>
 (1928; London: Penguin, 1994) 75. Lawrence’s “democracy of touch” 
echoes the ideas put forward in his essay on “Democracy” (1919), where 
he argues for a restoration of Whitman’s democratic vision, which he 
defines as “a struggle to liberate human beings from the fixed, 
arbitrary control of ideals, into free spontaneity” (“Democracy,” <em>Reflections on the Death of a Porcupine and Other Essays</em>, ed. Michael Herbert [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988] 61-83 [quotation at 78]).</span>
 Touch defines influence; touch defines marriage; touch defines the 
poetic gesture implied in “something equivalent to creation”; and touch 
defines the imperative demand that will not leave you alone. Duncan’s 
focus on touch provides a way of thinking about the relationship between
 hermetic vision and political engagement because it draws our attention
 to the permeable boundary between self and other.</p>
<p class="strong">Writing from Myth: Blake’s Influence and the Texture of Experience</p>
<p>If the binary of self and other seems too rigid and modish, I find my
 use of it redeemed somewhat by Duncan’s own claim that the <span class="notecall">“fictional form operates to move the poet and the reader into an ‘other’ space in the reality of which actual space fades.”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 29.</span>
 Otherness, for Duncan, suggests a creative range of meaning and 
possibility and a textured density of experience. The binary therefore 
resists static interpretation. Its terms are complex, but this 
complexity serves to intensify rather than unbind their structural 
opposition.</p>
<p>The insistent touch of the other, or “poetry … ‘imperatively 
demanded,’” is described in “The Truth and Life of Myth” as the basis 
for an understanding of poetry as an embodied medium: <span class="notecall">“The
 mythic content comes to us, commanding the design of the poem; it calls
 the poet into action, and with whatever lore and craft he has prepared 
himself for that call, he must answer to give body in the poem to the 
formative will.”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 13.</span>
 The bias that Duncan places on this idea of the poet as a romantic 
prophet-artist, speaking the truth of myth, lies in his sense of what it
 means to “give body in the poem.” The first thing to understand is that
 poetics, for Duncan, introduces an interface between the body as a 
poetic text and the poetic text as a body. In other words, the poetic 
text, summoned by the “formative will,” is inextricable from the texture
 of experience.</p>
<p>Before I elaborate on the way that this thinking conditions Duncan’s reading of Blake in <em>Roots and Branches</em> and <em>Fictive Certainties</em>,
 it is necessary to understand more about the terms on which he came to 
know of the English painter-poet—and to admire him as much as he did. <span class="notecall">Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century readings of Blake frequently characterized him as an occult or mystic poet.</span><span class="sidenote">See, for example, Yeats and Ellis, Aleister Crowley, Theodore Roethke, and H.D.</span>
 Raised by theosophists, Duncan came naturally to a vocabulary of 
correspondences. His adoptive parents were followers of Madame 
Blavatsky, avid readers of Swedenborg, and devotees of the occult. 
Duncan explains their faith:
</p><blockquote><span class="notecall">For my parents, the truth of 
things was esoteric (locked inside) or occult (masked by the apparent), 
and one needed a “lost” key in order to piece out the cryptogram of who 
wrote Shakespeare or who created the universe and what his real message 
was. From the theosophy of the 1890s my maternal grandmother had passed 
from Spiritualism to become an elder in an Hermetic Brotherhood, similar
 to and contemporaneous with the Order of the Golden Dawn to which Yeats
 belonged. Not only stories and books, but dreams and life itself, were 
to be read in terms of contained and revealed messages, even as in our 
time works of art, dreams and daily life are read by devotees of 
psychoanalysis, or as the People of the Book—Jews, Christians and 
Moslems—have always read God’s intent in the world, in history, and 
whatever written record. For theosophists, psychoanalysts, and the 
converts of revealed religions, it is not the story that is primary but 
the meaning behind the story.</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 3.</span></blockquote>
<p>For Duncan, the problem with this approach arises out of the very 
nature of narrative appreciation, whereby the sensitive mind is opened 
to the nuances of human emotion and interaction: <span class="notecall">“The truth of a story is not rooted in wisdom but in the sense of the drama of life.”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 4.</span> Here again, we see the way his thinking developed along lines compatible with, and influenced by, Olson, who also claims: <span class="notecall">“[the
 stance of projective verse] may, the way things look, lead to a new 
poetics and to new concepts from which some sort of drama, say, or of 
epic, perhaps, may emerge.”</span><span class="sidenote">Olson 3.</span> Duncan explains: <span class="notecall">“As
 I continue to be involved with the reading of Plato, not only myth but 
truth itself is disturbing, the actuality of time itself disturbed by 
the reality of what is happening.”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “The Truth and Life of Myth” 5.</span>
 Although Duncan thought in terms of correspondence, he was well aware 
of the disruptive nature such correspondence could take, and the 
vocabulary of dramatic action was one way of expressing the human 
significance of that disruption.</p>
<p>Blake was a key player in Duncan’s conscious exploration of 
derivation and poetic expression. Duncan’s sense that events and 
individual poems happen as expressions of an ultimate poetry that 
disturbs the actuality of time with the reality of what is happening at 
its core bears close relation to his sense of Blake’s inspirational 
quality. In “Man’s Fulfillment in Order and Strife,” Duncan claims: <span class="notecall">“We
 must go beyond the sincere into the fiction whose authors, Blake tells 
us, are in Eternity. We must set up in the midst of the truth of What 
Is, the truth of what we imagine.”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “Man’s Fulfillment in Order and Strife,” <em>Fictive Certainties</em> 112.</span>
 The particular implications of the reference to Blake, itself the 
starting point for Duncan’s “Variations on Two Dicta of William Blake,” 
will be discussed in more detail later in this section. But there is a 
general sense in which Duncan’s claim illustrates the kind of visionary 
poet he thought Blake was and the work that such poetry could do in the 
modern world. It is essential that “the truth of what we imagine” is to 
be set up “in the midst of the truth of What Is.” As with Blake, the 
place and purpose of Duncan’s visionary poetics are always intrinsic to 
the world of events.</p>
<p>Duncan received from his occultist parents an education that 
encouraged him to read poetry as a sign system that enclosed, in however
 difficult a manner, spiritual truths. But he was equally concerned to 
sustain individual freedoms and the idiosyncracies of present identities
 in combination with a lasting sense of eternal truth or meaning. He put
 it brilliantly in “Towards an Open Universe”: <span class="notecall">“Our
 consciousness, and the poem as a supreme effort of consciousness, comes
 in a dancing organization between personal and cosmic identity.”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “Towards an Open Universe,” <em>Fictive Certainties</em> 78.</span>
</p><p><span class="notecall">Duncan’s “Variations on Two Dicta of William Blake”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “Variations on Two Dicta of William Blake,” <em>Roots and Branches</em> 48-53.</span> works precisely because Blake’s aphoristic style (as used in <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>,
 for example) has a deceptive simplicity and universal applicability 
that allow Duncan to sustain the “dancing organization,” in this case 
expressed through the metaphor of musical variations, of his poem. One 
of the fundamental creative principles of musical variation is the 
plainness of the original tune. Musical variations allow for the 
exploration of register. You can move from the sublime to the ridiculous
 by radical changes in musical accompaniment, but the melody will still 
be recognizable. Similarly, the aphoristic (if not straightforward) 
quality of Blake’s lines allows Duncan to explore what they might mean 
in different moods, contexts, and modes of being. Like a melody, the 
dicta provide the basis for an exploration of register. Like a musical 
accompaniment, Duncan’s tone is constantly shifting around them. 
Duncan’s attraction to variation is that of Hermes, god of poets and 
thieves. A good composer comes into his own creativity more completely 
in the presence of others. Duncan draws his poetic power from the same 
activity. It is not just what Blake says but the way he says it that 
stimulates Duncan’s meditation on the texture of experience. In the 
claim they lay to the absolute, the dicta “Mental Things are alone Real”
 (from <em>A Vision of the Last Judgment</em>) and “the Authors are in 
Eternity” (from Blake’s letter to Thomas Butts, 6 July 1803) also invite
 an interrogation of their status in the compromised conditions of 
living life. These conditions make up the drama that Duncan finds 
lacking in a mythopoeic imagination that focuses only on wisdom and 
truth. It is here that the dialogue he has with Blake starts to creep 
toward the ethical, as his poem engages with the actuality of human 
suffering as part of the poetic texture of experience.</p>
<p>One of the most poignant moments in Duncan’s poem occurs at the start of the second section.
</p><blockquote><span style="padding-left: 30px">How long dare I withhold myself</span><br>
<span style="padding-left: 70px">my Lord withholds.</span><br>
<br>
I shy a glance that he too shies.<br>
<span style="padding-left: 30px">The authors of the look</span><br>
write with our eyes<br>
<span style="padding-left: 30px">broken phrases of their book.</span></blockquote>
Examining the shared emotional positions of devotion and desire, Duncan 
explores the implication that Blake’s dictum “the Authors are in 
Eternity” has for human beings. The scene pivots on an uneasy 
negotiation of authorial agency. The self-will, volition, and trembling 
energy of the first line both compromise and are compromised by cosmic 
writing. In “The Truth and Life of Myth,” Duncan not only implies 
admiration and support of Blake’s dictum, he goes as far as to suggest 
it as a basis for understanding his poetic texture. Here, Duncan shows 
us the darker side of the mythopoeic vision. This is about disconnect 
and distance longing to be bridged. There is distance in the opening act
 of withholding and there is also distance between the authors and the 
actors, who are paradoxically striving for authorship of their actions.
<p>Throughout the poem, touch is both the desired cohesive 
function—“touch, touch, / complete me such a world as I contain”—and 
something that true cohesion would inevitably transcend as otherness 
becomes an inescapable part of being.
</p><blockquote>I recognized in you my own presence<br>
<span style="padding-left: 30px">beyond touch, within being.</span><br>
What could I reach, reacht as I was?<br>
<br>
<span style="padding-left: 30px">The authors are in eternity.</span></blockquote>
Duncan makes this tension the modus operandi of his poetic engagement.
<blockquote><span style="padding-left: 30px; display: block;">I am the author of the authors<br>
and I am here. I do not dare<br>
rescue myself in you<br>
or you in me.</span></blockquote>
One could take from this poem a sense that authorship is both surrender 
and command. What I take from it is a sense that appreciation of the 
possibility of such poetics must also be combined with sensitivity to 
the human position. So, Duncan oscillates between an attitude that 
connects Blake with a Whitmanesque delight in the natural and cosmic man
 (“such a world as I contain” surely evokes Whitman’s celebratory “I 
contain multitudes”) and an attitude that acknowledges the tension and 
constraint inherent in dictation and the importance of existential 
variation. What is real, for Duncan, is <em>felt</em> as real, returning us again to the significance of touch as we are then touched by the suffering, separated lovers.
<p>So, Blake affects Duncan’s meditation on the texture of experience 
not only because his aphorisms provide the textual basis for poetic 
variation but also because, as a vital figure in Duncan’s conscious 
exploration of poetic derivation, he contributes to the problems that 
Duncan perceives in his own poetic process of becoming. These problems 
center on the desire for touch and the paradoxical awareness that touch 
confirms the externality of the other and does not go far enough. 
“Variations on Two Dicta of William Blake” ends:
</p><blockquote>We wait, two Others, outside ever<br>
<span style="padding-left: 30px">our eternal being</span><br>
<br>
<span style="padding-left: 30px">That is</span><br>
<br>
here, in this sad tableau too,<br>
<span style="padding-left: 30px">(for us, unwilling actors)</span><br>
<span style="padding-left: 30px">rapture.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="padding-left: 30px">The authors are in eternity</span><br>
<br>
<span style="padding-left: 30px">That is</span><br>
<br>
in thought intensely between us,<br>
restraint that acknowledges<br>
<br>
<span style="padding-left: 30px">the lover’s kiss.</span></blockquote>
In the poem’s final scene, self is relegated to the position of other. 
Duncan’s explorations of the meaning of Blake’s dicta in different 
registers of experience—registers that include such polar extremes as 
“Come, eyes, see more than you see! / For the world within and the outer
 world / rejoice as one” and “You talkd of ‘freedom’, / and I saw / how 
foreign I am from me”—finally arrive at an embrace that is conditioned 
by separation. Moreover, the feeling of separation is derived from the 
paradoxical inaccessibility and direct imposition of myth “That is / in 
thought intensely between us.” Duncan’s line breaks intensify the gulf 
through the suspension of breath while at the same time indicating a 
gasping desire for it to be bridged.
<p>The “restraint that acknowledges / the lover’s kiss” leads us to a 
further affinity in the attention that Blake and Duncan pay to formal 
boundaries. Both delight in the poetic binding of their productions at 
the very moment that they explore notions of freedom and expression. 
Both are simultaneously bound to form and bound to unlocking it. An 
example can be found in Blake’s “The Garden of Love”:</p>
<blockquote>I went to the Garden of Love.<br>
And saw what I never had seen:<br>
A Chapel was built in the midst,<br>
Where I used to play on the green.<br>
<br>
And the gates of this Chapel were shut,<br>
And Thou shalt not, writ over the door;<br>
So I turn’d to the Garden of Love,<br>
That so many sweet flowers bore,<br>
<br>
And I saw it was filled with graves,<br>
And tomb-stones where flowers should be:<br>
And Priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds,<br>
<span class="notecall">And binding with briars, my joys &amp; desires.</span><span class="sidenote">Blake, “The Garden of Love,” pl. 44, <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>, ed. Lincoln.</span></blockquote>
This poem gains its power from the pleasurable nature of the binding 
rhymes and rhythms, which deliberately conflict with the subject matter.
 As a poet, Duncan, like Blake, understood the vital possibility of 
constraint. Blake cannot do without the “briars” in the last line. “The 
Garden of Love” wears this symbolic crown of thorns in its formal 
constraints. This poem makes a far more subtle point than the one 
frequently attributed to it. It is not simply about the evils of 
organized religion; it is also about Blake’s poetic debt to 
organization. The choreography is unsettling because the verse mimics 
the encircling motion of the priests. While the narrative suggests 
condemnation of the church, the poetry participates in a necessary 
sacrifice of freedom to artistic form. Blake knew that lineaments are 
necessary to produce good art. <span class="notecall">In the mature work of <em>Jerusalem</em>, he aligns outline with “Visions of Imagination.”</span><span class="sidenote">Blake, <em>Jerusalem</em> pl. 74, <em>Jerusalem</em>, ed. with introduction and notes by Morton D. Paley (Princeton: Princeton University Press/William Blake Trust, 1991).</span>
<p>This is not to say that Blake is writing in support of the church. 
Clearly this would be absurd. It would also make the poem much weaker. 
But the poem does display the deep ambivalence that characterizes his 
attitude toward boundaries and the nature of the relationship he creates
 between freedom and form. Of course such a relationship draws attention
 to different kinds of form. There is a difference between the 
oppressive form of the church of history and the enabling form of 
artistic imagination. But Blake, like Duncan, is not blind to the points
 of contact. The “briars” find their echo in the “desires” of the same 
line. On the one hand this encourages an interpretation of oppressive 
authority limiting the passions. But it also implies equivalence; it 
hints that “briars” are, in some way, “desires” or desired. Blake sets 
up a carefully choreographed dance between freedom and form, the eternal
 world of spirit and the present world of bodies and facts. Boundaries 
are about relationship, but they can also be about imposition and 
constraint. The <span class="notecall">trembling hands in Duncan’s “Variations on Two Dicta of William Blake”</span><span class="sidenote">See section 7, lines 5-7 (<em>Roots and Branches</em> 52).</span>
 denote one such boundary; the stifling restrictions of party politics 
and organized religion denote the other. The point of contact can be 
summarized in the varied experience of touch, which ranges from caress 
to attack.</p>
<p>Duncan’s “My Mother Would Be a Falconress” deploys a rhythm that, 
like the bird it describes, reaches out toward the dangerous 
circumference of its being while retaining an anchor in the familiar. 
Let’s take the opening stanza:
</p><blockquote><span class="notecall">My mother would be a falconress,<br>
And I, her gay falcon treading her wrist,<br>
would fly to bring back<br>
from the blue of the sky to her, bleeding, a prize,<br>
where I dream in my little hood with many bells<br>
jangling when I’d turn my head.</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “My Mother Would Be a Falconress,” <em>Bending the Bow</em> (New York: New Directions, 1968) 52-54.</span></blockquote>
The rhythm created by the repetition of “I” (echoed in “fly,” “sky,” and
 softened and modified in “I’d”), the alliterative “bring back … blue … 
bleeding … bells,” “would … where … when,” and the modification of sound
 in “falconress” and “wrist,” “hood” and “head,” bind the breath that is
 thrown forth in a projective reading of this verse with the memory and 
echo of sounds that have already been uttered. The echoing repetitions 
and variations create a strong incantatory rhythm rooted in the familiar
 that exists in vital conflict with the momentary bid for freedom 
represented in the falcon’s flight and rhythmically suggested by the 
poem’s push outwards. There is, of course, a beautiful symmetry with the
 subject matter. The falcon’s flight is dictated by the falconress. He 
not only flies at her bidding, he goes to do her murderous work. And he 
also draws blood from her. The boundaries of his flight are therefore 
defined by blood. The edges are dangerous, vicious; they are also a 
necessary condition for movement.
<p>Duncan’s and Blake’s shared preoccupation with boundary, with the 
tangible, bloody evidence of birds and briars, starts to map the common 
ground in their sense of vision. To “set up in the midst of the truth of
 What Is, the truth of what we imagine” breeds conflict. The penetrative
 mobility between the present and the eternal and between form and 
freedom is a basis for understanding poetics as a hermeneutic of the 
world of relationships and binary oppositions. In the following section I
 will suggest that the concerns I have been talking about in <em>Roots and Branches</em> become overtly political in <em>Bending the Bow</em>. This is evident not only in the penetrative violence of “My Mother Would Be a Falconress,” <span class="notecall">which Duncan wrote after nights reading Blake’s bloody images of rape in <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em>,</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “A Lammas Tiding,” <em>Bending the Bow</em> 51.</span> but also in Duncan’s “Up Rising,” which is itself indebted to Blake’s <em>America</em>, and in his more general introductory remarks on the grotesque state of American democracy.</p>
<p class="strong">Poetic Lore and Political Engagement</p>
<p>One way of understanding the interface that Blake and Duncan set up 
between personal, poetic, and political formation is through the idea of
 the grotesque, a form that embodies an uncomfortable otherness. <span class="notecall">For Geoffrey Harpham, the word “designates a condition of being just out of focus, just beyond the reach of language.”</span><span class="sidenote">Geoffrey Galt Harpham, <em>On the Grotesque: Strategies of Contradiction in Art and Literature</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1982) 3.</span>
 The grotesque belongs to the liminal realm. The scene is one of 
metamorphosis or transition, the self’s process of becoming, its fight 
with an excess of self that it would like to name other. The grotesque 
form is consequently at odds with itself. Harpham describes it as 
indicative of an idea too big for form, but it seems to me to be 
precisely the integral and constitutive relationship between form and 
idea that makes it such a useful concept to apply to the points of 
contact between Duncan and Blake. The grotesque form gives the 
appearance of struggle precisely because it is so difficult to combine 
two dissonant modes of being in a single formal expression. But, 
precisely because of its uncomfortable dissonance, it is a useful theory
 with which to read these poets’ conceptions of self (in dialogue or 
romance with the self’s own emanations, influences, and otherness), 
poetry (expressive of a greater poetics), and politics (as related to 
normative and deviant notions of individual and national behavior).</p>
<p>In his introduction to <em>Bending the Bow</em>, Duncan writes:
</p><blockquote>We enter again and again the last days of our own 
history, for everywhere living productive forms in the evolution of 
forms fail, weaken, or grow monstrous, destroying the terms of their 
existence. We do not mean an empire; a war then, as if to hold all China
 or the ancient sea at bay, breaks out at a boundary we name <em>ours</em>.
 It is a boundary beyond our understanding. Now, where other nations 
before us have flounderd, we flounder. To defend a form that our very 
defense corrupts. We cannot rid ourselves of the form to which we now 
belong. And in this drama of our own desperation we are drawn into a 
foreign desperation. For our defense has invaded an area of our selves 
that troubled us. Cities laid waste, villages destroyd, men, women and 
children hunted down in their fields, forests poisond, herds of 
elephants screaming under our fire—it is all so distant from us we hear 
only what we imagine, making up what we surely are doing. When in 
moments of vision I see back of the photographt details and the daily 
body counts actual bodies in agony and hear—what I hear now is the 
desolate bellowing of some ox in a ditch—madness starts up in me. <span class="notecall">The pulse of this sentence beats before and beyond all proper bounds and we no longer inhabit what we thought properly our own.</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, <em>Bending the Bow</em> i.</span></blockquote>
In this rendering of the grotesque, or “monstrous,” contemporary 
condition, it is both impossible and undesirable to ignore the 
slipperiness with which Duncan shifts between political, personal, and 
poetic positions, emphasizing their interdependence. For if this passage
 is a description of contemporary American democracy, which has 
compromised itself by its aggressive actions in Vietnam, it is also a 
psychological exploration of this condition at an individual level (“our
 defense has invaded an area of our selves that troubled us”) and a 
meditation on the poetics of experience (“the pulse of this sentence 
beats before and beyond all proper bounds”).
<p>Theorizing about the grotesque, Margrit Shildrick suggests that <span class="notecall">“we
 are always and everywhere vulnerable precisely because the monstrous is
 not only an exteriority. … what is at issue is the permeability of the 
boundaries that guarantee the normatively embodied self.”</span><span class="sidenote">Margrit Shildrick, <em>Embodying the Monster: Encounters with the Vulnerable Self</em> (London: Sage, 2002) 1.</span>
 As the otherness of the grotesque is poetically encoded or figuratively
 embodied in the normative self, the relation between self and other is 
such that <span class="notecall">“the encounter with the strange is not a
 discrete event but the constant condition of becoming.” “Both are in 
play, then,” she argues, “on a plane where conceptual logics cannot be 
distinguished from the corporeality of becoming in the world.”</span><span class="sidenote">Shildrick 1.</span>
 To make this less abstract we might consider the way that Blake and 
Duncan present the body, and particularly the differential body (gay, 
black, gendered), as intrinsic to the ontological and ethical processes 
of self and nation. As Duncan’s opening to <em>Bending the Bow</em> 
illustrates, when the monstrous becomes a way of reflecting on the self,
 it is at once disturbing and progressive. America’s engorged body 
politic refutes the binary of self and other that Duncan perceives to be
 driving its actions in Vietnam. Duncan’s presentation of America’s 
monstrous democracy therefore demands a reappraisal of normative 
identity and a reassessment of political activity.</p>
<p>For Shildrick, the grotesque draws attention to the discursive nature
 of embodiment and attests to the vulnerability and unpredictability at 
the heart of the process of becoming. It is this emphasis on 
indeterminacy and process that makes her theory of the grotesque body 
interesting in relation to Blake and Duncan. As we have seen, Blake and 
Duncan posit the body as a poetic field and poetry as an embodied 
medium. Duncan claims: <span class="notecall">“This poetry, the ever 
forming of bodies in language in which breath moves, is a field of 
ensouling. Each line, intensely, a soul thing, a contribution; a 
locality of the living.”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, <em>Bending the Bow</em> ii.</span>
 Blake’s characters are a testament to the discursive nature of 
embodiment, their forms created visually by his varied illustrations and
 linguistically by the politically charged ways of seeing exemplified in
 his skillful manipulations of genre. In <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em>,
 a poem that Duncan read repeatedly, the body of Oothoon becomes a locus
 for interrogating the sentimental and voyeuristic qualities of feminine
 antislavery writing, the association of prophetic utterance with 
masculine violence, and the place of the marginalized in poetic speech. 
Blake’s and Duncan’s shared sense of poetry as an embodied medium is 
evident in the former’s complex cast of mythological characters and the 
latter’s repeated emphasis on the poetics of lived (and necessarily 
embodied) experience.</p>
<p>In Blake’s <em>Visions</em>, the body comes under attack; its 
integrity is compromised and its status overdetermined as individual 
figures are represented both visually and verbally in multiple and 
sometimes contrasting ways. <span class="notecall">Oothoon, for example,
 appears as muddy-colored, light, pinkish, and brown as Blake furthers 
his concern with modes of perception and representation.</span><span class="sidenote">For example, she is brown in <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=vda.f.illbk.09&amp;java=no" target="_blank">object 9</a> of copy F and pink in <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=vda.i.illbk.09&amp;java=no" target="_blank">object 9</a> of copy I; dark in <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=vda.p.illbk.09&amp;java=no" target="_blank">object 9</a> of copy P and light in <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=vda.a.illbk.05&amp;java=no" target="_blank">object 5</a> of copy A (all in the <em>William Blake Archive</em>).</span>
 Our attention is drawn to the idea of threatened boundaries through 
forcible bodily penetration. There are multiple rapes. The first clear 
rape, carried out by the slaveholder Bromion, deflowers the gentle 
Oothoon, “the soft soul of America,” within the first twenty lines of 
the poem. The rape is noticeable for its suddenness. Its violence lies 
in the breathtaking speed with which it occurs and the amputated nature 
of Blake’s description. The verb is monosyllabic. <span class="notecall">The phrase is abrupt: “Bromion rent her with his thunders.”</span><span class="sidenote">William Blake, <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> pl. 4, <em>The Early Illuminated Books</em>,
 ed. with introductions and notes by Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and
 Joseph Viscomi (Princeton: Princeton University Press/William Blake 
Trust, 1993).</span> It stands in stark contrast to the undulating 
luscious feminine rhythms of the opening fifteen lines, which describe 
the chained sexual passions of England’s women as they “sigh” toward 
America. From the opening lines, which refer to the curvaceous 
“mountains” and “valleys” of the daughters of Albion, to the 
“wander[ing]” of Oothoon as she travels in loose fashion through the 
“vales” of Leutha, to her journey over the rolling waves as she moves 
toward Theotormon after symbolically plucking the flower from Leutha’s 
valley, Blake’s writing dwells on the soft curves and gentle motion 
associated with feminine seductive power. The rape by Bromion forces 
itself on the poem, halting this flow of feminine allure. <span class="notecall">Oothoon is left prostrate and still: “on his stormy bed / Lay the faint maid.”</span><span class="sidenote">Blake, <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> pl. 4, <em>The Early Illuminated Books</em>, ed. Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi.</span> Oothoon’s immobility heightens the contrast with the wandering movement of earlier lines.</p>
<p>In one sense Blake rehearses a rather familiar trope of rape as 
colonial domination and possession, aligning the female body with the 
land. He takes it further, however, by suggesting a gendering of poetic 
utterance. While Oothoon wanders in Leutha’s vale, the poetic movement 
is characterized by yearning desire. When she is raped, Blake’s diction 
becomes violent and abbreviated. This rape is not the first suggestion 
of violence in the poem, nor is it the last. When Oothoon “pluck[s]” the
 flower from the valley of Leutha, her action invites comparison with 
Bromion’s. This is more than understandable, given the way the loss of 
female virginity was described in contemporary literature. In some 
cases, the description closely mirrored that of rape. <span class="notecall">When Fanny Hill loses her virginity in John Cleland’s <em>Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure</em>, for example, she is subject to “fierce tearing and rending.”</span><span class="sidenote">Quoted by Caroline Jackson-Houlston, “‘The lineaments of … desire’: Blake’s <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> and Romantic Literary Treatments of Rape,” <em>Queer Blake</em>, ed. Helen P. Bruder and Tristanne Connolly (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010) 156.</span>
 Even as she plucks the flower, Oothoon remains open to sensual 
experience. This paradoxical meaning is carried in the sexually 
suggestive act of deflowering that simultaneously signals the rejection 
of sexual experience. It is important to the voice that Oothoon finds 
later in the poem that she retains this openness. Virginity, here, is 
not false modesty but innocence and possibility.</p>
<p>After Bromion rapes her, Oothoon figuratively calls a second rape upon herself as a means to redemption from the first:
</p><blockquote><span class="notecall">I call with holy voice! kings of the sounding air,<br>
Rend away this defiled bosom that I may reflect,<br>
The image of Theotormon on my pure transparent breast.<br>
<br>
The Eagles at her call descend &amp; rend their bleeding prey;<br>
Theotormon severely smiles. her soul reflects the smile;<br>
As the clear spring mudded with feet of beasts grows pure &amp; smiles.</span><span class="sidenote">Blake, <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> pl. 5, <em>The Early Illuminated Books</em>, ed. Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi.</span></blockquote>
The rape by Bromion turns Oothoon’s body into a cage. This is reflected 
in her inability to cry: “Oothoon weeps not. she cannot weep!” Her body 
encloses itself and it is only through violent and bloody penetration 
that she can unlock it. The following plate accentuates the suggestion 
of a second rape. Oothoon lies upon her back, head and arms flung back, 
legs slightly splayed and chest lifted up toward the ravenous bird in a 
clear indication of sexual invitation. The eagle’s beak protrudes 
sharply as, wings splayed in downward flight, he plunges it into 
Oothoon’s proffered flesh.
<p>Oothoon’s summons, “I call with holy voice,” assumes the power of the bard, introduced in the opening to <em>Songs of Experience</em>
 as the prophet-artist who “Present, Past, &amp; Future sees.” Oothoon 
presents herself as passive, but she has the decisive power of voice, 
while Theotormon ineffectively weeps on the threshold. Her voice 
occupies the space that Theotormon refuses to fill with love for her. 
But without Theotormon’s love and without sexual fulfillment Oothoon’s 
words become repetitious: <span class="notecall">“I cry, Love! Love! Love! happy happy Love!”</span><span class="sidenote">Blake, <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> pl. 10, <em>The Early Illuminated Books</em>, ed. Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi.</span>
 Her song is iterative, its generative potential frustrated by the bind 
of shame that keeps Theotormon from fulfilling her desires.</p>
<p>In Blake’s illuminated book, the image of Theotormon’s eagle 
penetrating Oothoon appears under his only speech. The juxtaposition of 
Theotormon’s passive bemoaning of his own sorrow and his eagle’s violent
 activity is striking. The eagle acts as he cannot. Like the daughters 
of Albion who can only “weep” and “eccho,” Theotormon denies his own 
power for decisive action, existing in a position of liminality that 
Oothoon powerfully rejects.</p>
<p>Oothoon’s bardic imagination offers another way of seeing, and one 
that has a direct bearing on Blake’s own conception of the political 
importance of the prophet-artist. Oothoon calls the eagles to rend her 
flesh in order that she may “reflect, / The image of Theotormon.” While 
her self-inflicted rape is a potently aggressive act of self-harm, it 
makes her into a vehicle for truth. She is offering to tell the 
suppressed story of the poem and, in bringing the marginalized 
Theotormon center stage, she hopes to recover his love. At this moment 
Oothoon’s “holy voice” might redeem the status of narrative, which is 
under scrutiny in this poem. Her violent act suggests both a 
reinscription of her “bleeding” virgin state of openness and possibility
 and a reconfiguration of form:
</p><blockquote>The Eagles at her call descend &amp; rend their bleeding prey;<br>
Theotormon severely smiles. her soul reflects the smile;<br>
As the clear spring mudded with feet of beasts grows pure &amp; smiles.</blockquote>
In this further degradation of her flesh, Oothoon takes on a shifting 
color, which makes us think of dark and light skin. In one sense, this 
indeterminate color emphasizes the fluid condition of her soul which, 
like a “clear spring,” “reflects” Theotormon’s smile. However, it also 
configures Oothoon’s love in terms familiar from colonialist discourse. 
We see through the eyes of the daughters again as Oothoon’s core appears
 white.
<p>Introducing the prophetic mode in conjunction with tropes familiar 
from contemporary antislavery writing furthers Blake’s concern with 
modes of seeing and the politics of representation. Oothoon’s cry for 
freedom is an attack on received forms of perception:
</p><blockquote><span class="notecall"><span style="padding-left: 155px">Arise my Theotormon I am pure.</span><br>
Because the night is gone that clos’d me in its deadly black.<br>
They told me that the night &amp; day were all that I could see;<br>
They told me that I had five senses to inclose me up.<br>
And they inclos’d my infinite brain into a narrow circle,<br>
And sunk my heart into the Abyss, a red round globe hot burning<br>
Till all from life I was obliterated and erased.</span><span class="sidenote">Blake, <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> pl. 5, <em>The Early Illuminated Books</em>, ed. Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi.</span></blockquote>
“They told me,” Oothoon repeats, lamenting the mental chains that taught
 her to see nothing other than the time-bound world of sense experience,
 to live from day to day guided by physical want and fear. Striking out 
against her oppressors, she stakes her claim to freedom in terms that 
emphasize her newfound ability to perceive a reality other than the 
temporal and locate meaning in figurative language.
<blockquote><span class="notecall">Instead of morn arises a bright shadow, like an eye<br>
In the eastern cloud: instead of night a sickly charnel house.</span><span class="sidenote">Blake, <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> pl. 5, <em>The Early Illuminated Books</em>, ed. Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi.</span></blockquote>
Theotormon, the cause of her present sorrow, remains caged. His ability 
to distinguish and find meaning is nullified by shame and grief.
<blockquote><span class="notecall"><span style="padding-left: 175px">To him the night and morn</span><br>
Are both alike: a night of sighs, a morning of fresh tears.</span><span class="sidenote">Blake, <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em> pl. 5, <em>The Early Illuminated Books</em>, ed. Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi.</span></blockquote>
<p>Reading Blake’s <em>Visions</em> in order to find “the poetic lore of
 what America is” and writing “My Mother Would Be a Falconress” in a 
semi-automatic state, Duncan claimed that he had constructed a poem 
about poets:
</p><blockquote>And, searching out the poetic lore of what America is, I had been reading Blake’s <em>Vision of the Daughters of Albion</em> these last few nights just before going to sleep. <em>“With what sense is it that the chicken shuns the ravenous hawk?”</em>
 I had read, and I said to myself, yes, there are bloody men, and I am 
not one of them but of chicken-kind, for I would never draw blood. Which
 goes to show one should be careful of vain self-delusions entertaind at
 bedtime. For now my dream would have me a hawk. And, hearing my 
account, Jess comments: “Especially since chickens do draw blood.” 
Whereupon, I recall those horrible cannibalistic hens I tended at 
Treesbank, that needed only the first sign of blood that might be left 
after egg-laying to tear at each other, bloody not from hunger but from 
malice, like so many poets furious in their pecking order.<br>
<br>
<span style="padding-left: 50px; display: block"><em>Do I draw blood then chicken-wise<br>
And hide myself in a hawk’s disguise?</em><span class="notecall"></span></span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “A Lammas Tiding,” <em>Bending the Bow</em> 51.</span></blockquote>
<p>The vocabulary of violence, which he derives from Blake, relates to 
political, poetic, and sexual power. It is political because it is about
 the violence of domination and futile aggression, which provides a 
rather pointed reflection on America’s actions in Vietnam. When Duncan 
writes in “My Mother Would Be a Falconress” “it seemd my human soul went
 down in flames,” it is hard to ignore the image of the American fighter
 plane crashing into Asian soil. It is poetic because it negotiates the 
difficulty of finding a place for individual voice free from the mother 
tongue and mothering or smothering forms of language:
</p><blockquote>I would be a falcon and go free.<br>
I tread her wrist and wear the hood,<br>
talking to myself, and would draw blood.</blockquote>
And it is sexual because of the unsettling evocation of rape where the 
gay poet-falcon’s “pierc[ing]” beak implies virginal deflowering as well
 as the daily plundering of life.
<p>Duncan would have known that the Egyptian sun-god, Ra, creator of the
 world, had the head of a falcon, and that he symbolically died each 
evening, crossing the boundary to the underworld, and was brought back 
to life in the morning. He would have been familiar with the ancient 
superstition that animals cross between realms more easily. So, for 
Duncan, with his defining interest in hermetic vision, choosing the 
falconress and falcon to represent the mother-son relationship is 
unlikely to have been accidental. Like Blake, he was more than able to 
relate cosmic and personal boundaries and boundary crossings on the same
 plane. In a clear echo of Blake’s <em>Visions</em>, the violence of Duncan’s poem suggests rape:
</p><blockquote>When will she let me bring down the little birds,<br>
pierced from their flight with their necks broken,<br>
their heads like flowers limp from the stem?</blockquote>
The deliberate double meaning of “bring down” and “pierced,” together 
with the simile in the last line, elides the difference between murder 
and deflowering rape. In the next line the pent-up aggression of 
Duncan’s poet-falcon turns on the mother, the origin of self, from which
 it cannot break free: “I tread my mother’s wrist and would draw blood.”
 Duncan takes from Blake the sense that rape can figure both as a symbol
 of oppression and as a source of controlling power. He also takes from 
Blake a desire to bring violence and ugliness center stage and confront 
their meaning and relevance. I have suggested that Blake’s poem opens 
our eyes to the possibility of poetic power sourced not in generic 
sentimental and sighing visions, but in the disruptive prophetic mode, 
vividly rendered in Oothoon’s second, self-willed rape and gloriously 
upheld in her discovery of the revelatory and liberating capacity of 
figurative language. Duncan is in dialogue with Blake on the 
possibilities of freedom through violence and the concomitant notions of
 futile henpecking poets and colonial oppression.
<p>Before I remark on “Up Rising,” I want to venture a few suggestions 
as to the connections a mind like Duncan’s or Blake’s, prone to repeated
 interfaces, analogies, and discursive ways of imagining, might have 
drawn between the penetrative quality of hermetic vision (in which one 
might find “the poetic lore of what America is”) and the violent 
penetration expressed in their images of rape. Reading “My Mother Would 
Be a Falconress,” we are left with a strong sense that if Duncan found a
 poetic lore governing the actuality of American society in Blake’s <em>Visions</em>,
 it was a lore of grotesque being. In the theoretical framework 
established at the start of this section, I suggested that the grotesque
 scene is one of metamorphosis or transition, the self’s process of 
becoming and its fight with an excess of self that it would like to name
 other. As Blake and Duncan posit a discursive interchange between the 
body as a poetic field and poetry as an embodied medium, the grotesque 
state of the raped body becomes a way of thinking about poetic utterance
 and the power of voice. Oothoon claims the unwanted otherness of 
Bromion as a part of herself and a source of poetic power when she calls
 upon Theotormon’s eagles to rend her flesh. Duncan makes a similarly 
uncomfortable move when he brings the falcon’s violence center stage in 
his poem.</p>
<p>If we return for a moment to the binary of self and other and the 
profound awareness of boundary and boundary crossing that I have argued 
mattered both to Duncan’s appreciation of Blake and to the broader 
poetics of which this appreciation was a part, we can see that otherness
 is both an unwelcome and invited intruder on the notion of self and 
essential to its formation. Here again, I think there is a very 
important sense in which Duncan’s poetry interrogates and problematizes 
the claim for visionary poetics that he makes in “Man’s Fulfillment in 
Order and Strife.” <span class="notecall">That is, “We must go beyond 
the sincere into the fiction whose authors, Blake tells us, are in 
Eternity. We must set up in the midst of the truth of What Is, the truth
 of what we imagine.”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “Man’s Fulfillment in Order and Strife” 112.</span> Duncan makes us think differently about Blake’s dictum because he never lets go of the tension it involves.</p>
<p>The eagle is, of course, also a symbol for America. Duncan 
consciously inherits Blake’s dialectic between spirit and society, 
thinking about the way such penetrative violence might take on a 
particular significance in the context of contemporary American foreign 
policy. By this I do not mean to suggest that Duncan simply reiterates 
the familiar trope of rape as colonial oppression, though to some extent
 this trope haunts his writing, as it haunts Blake’s. The rape imagery 
in “My Mother Would Be a Falconress” is part of a more abstract poetic 
and political concern with threatened boundaries. At the beginning of 
this section I cited Duncan’s opening to <em>Bending the Bow</em>, where
 he comments on the monstrous state of American democracy: “We enter 
again and again the last days of our own history, for everywhere living 
productive forms in the evolution of forms fail, weaken, or grow 
monstrous, destroying the terms of their existence.” This apocalyptic 
sense of an ending lacks the redemptive quality of light that will 
emerge out of darkness. Duncan calls the quality of imagination into 
question by implicating it as a part of the problem in his opening to <em>Bending the Bow</em>:
</p><blockquote>Cities laid waste, villages destroyd, men, women and 
children hunted down in their fields, forests poisond, herds of 
elephants screaming under our fire—it is all so distant from us we hear 
only what we imagine, making up what we surely are doing. When in 
moments of vision I see back of the photographt details and the daily 
body counts actual bodies in agony and hear—what I hear now is the 
desolate bellowing of some ox in a ditch—madness starts up in me. <span class="notecall">The pulse of this sentence beats before and beyond all proper bounds and we no longer inhabit what we thought properly our own.</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, <em>Bending the Bow</em> i.</span></blockquote>
The monstrous state of America is reflected in a monstrous poetic that 
is blind to the narrative of murder and destruction, blind to a 
narrative it does not want to acknowledge. Imagination, in this sense, 
is devoid of the penetrating prophetic function that Duncan then 
ascribes to “moments of vision.” Such moments, and the “madness” they 
generate, threaten the normative identity of the self and force an 
ecstatic embodying of the other.
<p>The poetic that governs Duncan’s engagement with Blake therefore has 
direct relevance to the nature of his political engagement. Duncan 
castigates contemporary American democracy because it denies this 
poetic. He suggests that America’s actions in Vietnam, which reflect the
 failing of American foreign policy to consider the way democracy might 
resist the violent perpetration of North American hegemony, pervert and 
destroy the democratic system that they are meant to protect. They are 
fighting “to defend a form that our very defense corrupts.” The impact 
of such defense is to close off evolution and destroy the very life and 
energy that are essential to the kind of redemptive, restorative, and 
ethical democratic vision that Duncan finds in his reading of Whitman, 
Blake, and Olson.</p>
<p>The relationship between Duncan’s poetic lore and political engagement is reciprocal. <span class="notecall">“Up Rising”</span><span class="sidenote">Duncan, “Up Rising,” Passages 25, <em>Bending the Bow</em> 81-83.</span> is one of a series of poems about war originally published as “Passages” in a separate publication titled <em>Of the War</em>.
 The war in Vietnam provides a way of thinking about conflict, that is 
to say the binary principle that I have argued is fundamental to 
Duncan’s poetic texture, just as the binary, the permeable boundary 
between self and other, provides a way of thinking about the war that is
 happening in Vietnam and the meaning of America, which is under 
scrutiny as a result. In “Up Rising,” Blake features as a writer of 
hermetic vision who offers a way of imagining the fundamental principles
 of America as they appeared at the moment of national inception, “in 
figures of fire and blood raging.” But the following line begins “… in 
what image?” as if Blake’s “figures” can’t fully embody the violence and
 horror of an America grown so fat on its own despotic idea of democracy
 that its “ravening eagle” knows no bounds and cannot satiate its 
destructive hunger for human flesh. The horror that Duncan perceives in 
contemporary foreign policy tests the principle of hermetic vision even 
as it contributes to his understanding of the texture and meaning of 
such vision through struggle and conflict.</p>
<p class="strong">Conclusions</p>
<p>The lament that opens <em>Bending the Bow</em> mourns the destruction
 of form as evolutionary process and discursive embodiment. Such form 
attests to the importance of permeable boundaries and an ethic rooted in
 the relationship between self and other. We have seen how and why Blake
 mattered to Duncan in this context, in terms of both poetic texture and
 political engagement, and how Duncan makes us think differently about 
Blake’s dicta and violence as a result. Duncan comes into his creative 
potential thinking about Blake in terms of touch. And touch defines the 
boundary of self both by reinscribing it as a real and tangible 
distinction and by offering a way of transgressing that distinction. In 
this way Duncan takes our understanding of Blake beyond the personal and
 poetic implications of myth toward an intensely ethical and political 
engagement.</p>
<p>The dialogue that Duncan has with Blake is part of a larger pattern 
in Blake’s American reception, where the English poet-painter both 
matters to a Whitmanesque tradition of mythic self-definition and helps 
expose the tensions inherent in that tradition. For Duncan, poetry, and 
particularly the romantic prophet-artist, needed to address and restore 
the meaning of American democracy. Filtered through Olson’s lens, Blake 
becomes part of the restoration of a Whitmanesque dream. Contemporary 
democracy, with its troubling exclusion of the other and a perceived 
tendency toward individual stultification as opposed to liberation and 
expansion, seems monstrous by comparison. In his experiment in 
life-writing, titled <em>The H.D. Book</em>, Duncan claimed: <span class="notecall">“Where
 a democracy is composed of a people in which the individual conscience 
and nature is not liberated, so that a common standard or consensus of 
the majority rules and not the union of each in free volition, the state
 is already totalitarian.”</span><span class="sidenote">“From <em>The H.D. Book</em>, Part II, Chapter 5,” <em>Sagetrieb</em>: Robert Duncan Special Issue 4.2-3 (fall and winter 1985): 42-43.</span>
 Duncan maintains the importance of the prophet-artist in the 
preservation of democratic individualism at a time when the very values 
of democracy and community seem hijacked by commercial and technocratic 
interest. He writes:
</p><blockquote><span class="notecall">The beauty of the poem, the 
poet’s sense of beauty, in itself, that cannot be bought and sold. 
Beauty, in a society based upon commodity-profit is ambivalently praised
 and despised. The popular mistrust, the industrial and commercial 
mistrust, opposes and destroys where it can individual sensitivity, as 
out of place in the “democracy” of big party politics or in the 
“community” of the modern city as individualist architecture with its 
romantic and expressive form, even ornament, is in the plans of the new 
functionalism.</span><span class="sidenote">“From <em>The H.D. Book</em>, Part II, Chapter 5” 49.</span></blockquote>
Duncan’s use of quotation marks around “democracy” and “community” 
indicates the corruption of the terms he holds in such high esteem. For 
it is in democracy and community realized in the intimacy and density of
 his poetry that Duncan finds hope for society. And while it is fair to 
say that he participates in the making of an American myth of Blake that
 is fundamentally optimistic in its desire to co-opt the English 
painter-poet into a restorative romantic vision, Duncan is also 
sensitive to the limitations of that vision and, like Blake and Whitman,
 <span class="notecall">he has doubts as to the capability of the prophet-artist to work within society and effect social change.</span><span class="sidenote">Whitman’s concerns appear strongest in his 1871 work <em>Democratic Vistas</em>. Blake’s anxieties surface throughout his canon but perhaps the best example is in <em>Vala</em>, where the prophetic function is recognized as a “delusive Phantom.”</span> “… in what image?” he asks his admired Blake, can we begin to embody and therefore address the grotesque state of our nation?
<p>After Duncan published <em>Bending the Bow</em> he pledged to keep 
away from the world of publication for fifteen years. His friend and 
contemporary poet Michael Palmer explained the decision in the following
 way:
</p><blockquote><span class="notecall">The story is well-known in poetry
 circles: around 1968, disgusted by his difficulties with publishers and
 by what he perceived as the careerist strategies of many poets, Duncan 
vowed not to publish a new collection for fifteen years. (There would be
 chapbooks along the way.) He felt that this decision would free him to 
listen to the demands of his (supremely demanding) poetics and would 
liberate the architecture of his work from all compromised 
considerations.</span><span class="sidenote">Michael Palmer, “Ground Work: On Robert Duncan,” &lt;﻿<a href="http://jacketmagazine.com/29/palmer-duncan.html" target="_blank">http://​jacketmagazine.​com/​29/​palmer-duncan.​html</a>﻿&gt; (last accessed 19 July 2011).</span></blockquote>
This move reveals “My Mother Would Be a Falconress” to be as much about 
Duncan’s frustrations at restrictions on his poetic freedom as it is 
homage to the revelatory power of the prophetic voice. Perhaps in 
retreating from publication, and therefore implicitly from society, 
Duncan felt he could better serve it in the end. But such a move also 
illustrates an inability to realize the dialectic between spirit and 
society that was fundamental to his sense of himself as a poet of 
hermetic vision, and also to his identification with Blake. This anxiety
 haunts Duncan’s reading of Blake, as perhaps it haunts the Whitmanesque
 myth of America that Blake helps Duncan reimagine, shadowing the 
visionary enterprise with the struggle and disillusionment felt by the 
very poets who most wanted to sustain it.
