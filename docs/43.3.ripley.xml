            <p>AS is well documented, Robert Cromek had a great talent for marketing that emerged in his
promotion of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n99"
type="note">1</ref> He ran a two-year advertising campaign in more than ten newspapers and magazines across
England and Scotland. These included the <hi rend="i">Birmingham Gazette</hi> and <hi rend="i">Birmingham
Commercial Herald</hi> (July 1806), <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine</hi> (July 1807), <hi rend="i">Artist</hi>
(August 1807), <hi rend="i">Monthly Literary Recreations</hi> (September 1807), <hi rend="i">Literary
Panorama</hi> and <hi rend="i">Manchester Gazette</hi> (November 1807), <hi rend="i">Wakefield Star and
West-Riding Advertiser</hi> (May 1808), <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi>, <hi rend="i">Athenaeum
Magazine</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Bristol Gazette</hi>, <hi rend="i">and Public Advertiser</hi> (June 1808), and
<hi rend="i">Monthly Literary Advertiser</hi> (July 1808).<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n100" type="note">2</ref> As the list of subscribers in the published volume signifies, Cromek did not
limit himself to the literary and artistic markets of London and was ready to find new subscribers across
Britain.</p>
            <note id="n99">1. In their facsimile of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, Robert N. Essick and Morton
D. Paley call Cromek “an energetic promoter” (<hi rend="i">Robert Blair’s</hi> The Grave, 
<hi rend="i">Illustrated by William Blake: A Study with Facsimile</hi> [London: Scolar Press, 1982] 19). See also
G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004)
[hereafter <hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2)] 208.</note>
            <note id="n100">2. Except for the <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine</hi>, these references are found in
<hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2). See David Groves, “‘Great and Singular Genius’: Further References to Blake
(and Cromek) in the <hi rend="i">Scots Magazine</hi>,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 39.1 (summer 2005):
47.</note>
            <p>If there was anything strange about his marketing strategy, however, it was his initial neglect
of London for Birmingham during the summer of 1806. But a previously undiscovered announcement, which was
reprinted two times, suggests that Cromek was very mindful of the London marketplace that summer:
			<q>Mr. Cromek intends to publish in the course of the ensuing winter a series of 12 [twelve]
Engravings, etched in a very superior style of excellence by Louis Schiavonetti, from the original  inventions
of William Blake, illustrative of Blair’s popular Poem “The Grave.” In consequence of the originality of
the designs and their vigorous expression, the work has been honoured with the patronage of the principal
members of the Royal Academy, and the first professors of art in the metropolis, and by the subscriptions of
upwards of 300 [250] of the most distinguished amateurs.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n101"
type="note">3</ref></q>
              In London, the notice ran in the July issue of the <hi rend="i">Universal Magazine</hi> and the
August issue of the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi>. It is the only reference to Blake in the 
<hi rend="i">Universal Magazine</hi>,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n102" type="note">4</ref>
and was published in a section entitled “Modern Discoveries, and Improvements in Arts, Sciences, and
Literature,” alongside other forthcoming books. In the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi>, it appeared in
its “Monthly Retrospect of the Fine Arts,” which included prints and books with prints. Since the text is
nearly identical in both magazines, the announcement was presumably written by Cromek and not the editors. It
is also found in the October 1806 <hi rend="i">Monthly Anthology, and Boston Review</hi>, which reprinted the
<hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> version in its “Intelligence” section that provided notices regarding
British books. This notice may be the earliest reference to Blake in America, and it might explain the
presence of J. Brown from Boston in the list of the subscribers to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>. While it is
possible that Cromek had his eye on the potential market across the Atlantic, it is more likely, given
Blair’s popularity in America, that the <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> project simply appealed to the Boston
editor, who reprinted it without either Blake’s or Cromek’s knowledge.</p>
            <note id="n101">3. “Modern Discoveries, and Improvements in Arts, Sciences, and Literature,”
<hi rend="i">Universal Magazine</hi> 6 (July 1806): 47-48; “Monthly Retrospect of the Fine Arts,” 
<hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> (Aug. 1806): 61; “Intelligence,” <hi rend="i">Monthly Anthology, and Boston
Review</hi> 3 (Oct. 1806): 559.
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Universal Magazine</hi> version is quoted above, with the numbers in brackets
appearing in the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> and <hi rend="i">Monthly Anthology</hi>. In accidentals,
these versions differ from the <hi rend="i">Universal Magazine</hi> notice in capitals, lineation,
punctuation, and the use of the phrase “the [as opposed to “their”] vigorous expression.” More
significantly, the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> and <hi rend="i">Monthly Anthology</hi> leave out the
reference to the patronage of Royal Academy members, deleting “the principal members of the Royal Academy,
and.”</p></note>
            <note id="n102">4. The <hi rend="i">Universal Magazine</hi> 11 (Feb. 1809): 132-39, would give a
very favorable review of Cromek’s <hi rend="i">Reliques of Robert Burns</hi>.</note>
            <p>The biggest question raised by the announcements is why the number of subscribers was reduced
from 300 in the <hi rend="i">Universal Magazine</hi> to 250 in the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> version.
Perhaps the <hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> version was written first but published later. This idea would
accord with the fact that the number of subscribers seems to have risen steadily. In November 1807 Cromek
reported getting seventy-two “at Manchester in less than 3 Weeks” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2) 249), and the
change in number in the announcements implies that he was working at a similar clip in the summer of 1806. By
the time the book was published there would be “578 subscribers for 688 copies.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n103">5</ref> Despite Cromek’s success in garnering subscriptions, the idea that the
volume would be published in the “ensuing winter” suggests that he envisioned a very truncated production
schedule, meaning that the famous portrait of Blake was likely not part of the original plan, since Blake did
not sit for Thomas Phillips until April 1807 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>(2) 232). Finally, the newly discovered
notices offer some evidence that Blake was aware of how <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> was being marketed. They
were the only advertisements for <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> to reference “the most distinguished
amateurs,” and Blake’s first recorded reference to the English amateur came in his letter to the 
<hi rend="i">Monthly Magazine</hi> (1 July 1806) defending Fuseli’s painting of Dante’s Ugolino. As Paley has
recently stressed, “amateur” was still considered a novel, if not foreign, import in English discussion of
the arts, and Blake’s parody of it in his notebook quip
              <pb id="p43-110" n="110"/>
            “The Cunning sures &amp; the Aim at yours” may have been spurred by its association with
Cromek’s fashionable marketing language.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n104"

Erdman, newly rev. ed. (New York: Anchor-Random House, 1988) 510. As Paley observes, the first recorded use of
“amateur” was in 1784, and it was still new enough in 1803 that Rees’s <hi rend="i">Cyclopædia</hi> had
to gloss it (“Blake’s Poems on Art and Artists,” <hi rend="i">Blake and Conflict</hi>, ed. Sarah
