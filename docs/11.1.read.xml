                        Dunlap (London: Henry Colburn, 1813), is a reference to Blake which has not
                        been previously noted. Cooke (1756-1811), a well-known actor, was a
                        subscriber to <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi>, and among his diary entries
                        (recorded in his <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, II, 65-70) are several dealing
                        with the arrival of his copy: 
						<q> Thursday, Jan. 5th [1809]<lb/>
 Received a
                            note from a Mr. Cromek, informing me that a work I subscribed two
                            guineas for, at Liverpool, above two years ago,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n63" type="note">1</ref> and which I had entirely forgotten, is
                            published, and requesting my address, that my copy might be sent.<supplied

                                performed at the Theatre-Royal between 19 August and 11 September
                                1806. A short letter of introduction written for Cromek by Henry
                                Fuseli to his patron, the Liverpool benefactor William Roscoe, is
                                dated 16 July 1806. See G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake

                                September 1808, Cromek needed a new address for Cooke.</note>

						Cooke’s diary shows that Cromek was in Liverpool for at
                        least part of the time that Cooke was there during the latter part of August
                        and first weeks of September, 1806. Cromek’s stay was apparently
                        worthwhile, for the “List of Subscribers” in <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> includes
fifty-one Liverpool residents. Cromek probably
                        had come to Liverpool from Birmingham, where he ran nearly identical
                        advertisements for <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> in the 28 July 1806
                        Birmingham <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> and <hi rend="i">Commercial
                            Herald</hi>;<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n67"
type="note">5</ref> he then left Liverpool
                        probably for his native Yorkshire, where he gathered <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>
                        subscriptions in Halifax, Pontefract, Leeds, and, finally, Wakefield, where
                        he married Mrs. Elizabeth Charge in the parish church on 24 October 1806.

                            <hi rend="s">5</hi> The <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi>
                            advertisement is reproduced in Geoffrey Keynes, “Blake in the
                            Provinces,” <hi rend="i">Blake Newsletter</hi> 34 (Fall 1975),

                    </p>
                    <p>Cooke clearly is no intimate of either Cromek or Blake, and while he does not
                        seem to regard his two guineas as ill-spent, his interest in his new
                        acquisition is less than consuming. One wonders, in fact, if he ever opened
                        his copy of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> again.</p>
