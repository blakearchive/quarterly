          <p>In their 1987 facsimile of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, David Erdman and Cettina Magno
rearrange the pages of the manuscript “in the sequence now recognized as least departing from the textual
sequences called for by Blake’s own marks of instruction” (16).<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n9" type="note">1</ref> This change in sequence involved the renumbering of twenty-four pages over
twelve leaves, which Erdman presents in the following chart:

The numbers outside the brackets are those of Erdman and Magno’s new arrangement, used by their facsimile,
while those inside the brackets represent the older arrangement, used most notably by Bentley’s 1963
facsimile.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n10" type="note">2</ref>
	<note id="n9">1. The Four Zoas <hi rend="i">by William Blake: A Photographic Facsimile of the Manuscript with
Commentary on the Illuminations</hi>, eds. Cettina Tramontano Magno and David V. Erdman (Lewisburg: Bucknell

Transcript of the Poem, and a Study of its Growth and Significance</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon Press,
1963).</note></p>
          <p>Again presenting this chart in the 1988 new revised edition of <hi rend="i">The Complete Poetry
and Prose</hi>, Erdman acknowledges that to apply this new numbering in “the present text would be confusing
since Blake’s poem moves about (because of his own revisions) in a sequence that does not correspond exactly
to any sequence of the manuscript leaves” (E 818).<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n11"
type="note">3</ref> Yet, despite his recognition of the potential confusion that could result from applying
these new page numbers to the poem, Erdman in practice inconsistently adopts the new numbers in his text,
which drastically complicates the reader’s ability to refer back to either of the poem’s facsimiles, and
this confusion is only augmented by Erdman’s decision to leave his textual notes completely in the old
numbering. <note id="n11">3. <hi rend="i">The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</hi>, ed. David V.
Erdman, with commentary by Harold Bloom, rev. ed. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988).</note></p>
          <p>To facilitate, therefore, references back to the facsimiles from the now standard 1988 edition,
four tables are provided below rectifying Erdman’s inconsistencies and offering a few touchstones for
negotiating between Erdman’s text and the facsimiles. The first table corrects the page numbers found in the
text so that Erdman’s new numbering is consistently applied. The second changes the headings in the textual
notes so that they correspond to Erdman’s text as corrected by Table 1. More difficult to rectify in the
textual notes are the references to the pages that occur in Erdman’s prose. These are concentrated chiefly
on page 827, for pages 19-22, and between pages 836-41, for Nights VII and VIII. As the prose of 836-41
provides in large part Erdman’s reasoning in renumbering and rearranging the manuscript pages, it may be
simpler to explain this rearrangement in terms of Erdman’s new numbering.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n12" type="note">4</ref> In this arrangement, which is often made to sound more
difficult than it is, the pages of VIIa1 begin the Night, standing unaltered as 77-85:22. What once provided
the close for VIIb2, 95-98, follows, renumbered by Erdman as 87-90. This section commences on the second
portion of 87 [95] where Blake has written in the margin “Beginning of Night VII” and in the text
“Beginning of the Book Seventh Night” (Erdman and Magno 201). VIIb1 follows the last page of VIIb2, 90
[98], retaining its original numbers 91-94. The first portion of 87 [95] succeeds 94, followed by 85:23-47.
Although it is shown in Table 1, because this page begins VIIa2, it should be noted that Erdman mislabeled
what should be 85 (SECOND PORTION) as 95 [87] (SECOND PORTION) (E 367). 86 follows 85:23-47 unaltered,
succeeded by the remainder of VIIa2, originally 87-90 but renumbered 95-98. These pages are made up of the
Edward and Elenor print; hence, only 95 [97] and 98 [90] have text. Erdman concludes the night with the “End
of the Seventh Night” from page 90 [98]. This arrangement in both numbering systems is summarized in Table
3. <note id="n12">4. Erdman’s arrangement is that put forward by Mark S. Lefebvre’s “A Note on the
Structural Necessity of Night VIIb” in <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> 46 (fall 1978): 134,
an issue devoted to <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas.</hi> Erdman’s reasoning for accepting Lefebvre’s argument
is found in his “Night the Seventh: The Editorial Problem,” which follows Lefebvre’s piece, 135-39. John
Kilgore’s and Andrew Lincoln’s articles in the issue are important for coming to terms with some of the
complexities of the manuscript. Lincoln’s mastery of the manuscript is more recently demonstrated in his 
<hi rend="i">Spiritual History</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), which puts forth the best theory so far as to
how the poem developed. As he notes in his Appendix 4, W. H. Stevenson, in the second edition to 
<hi rend="i">The Complete Poems</hi> (UK: Longman House, 1989), adopts Blake’s instructions on page 9 of the
manuscript and inserts pages 19-22 at 9:33. Stevenson, it should be noted, uses the older page numbers but
adopts the same arrangement of the pages as Erdman: 19 [21], 20 [22], 21 [19], and 22 [20].</note></p>
          <p>Table 4 lists those manuscript pages whose texts are split up. This will preclude, I hope,
fishing for where the other portions of a particular manuscript page may be in the text’s arrangement. Note
here that the first portion of 91 is the title of VIIb and is not used by Erdman.</p>
