          <p>On 17 September 1927, the leading Blake scholar Geoffrey Keynes wrote to Eric
                        Maclagan, then director of the Victoria and Albert Museum:<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n171" type="note">*</ref><q> Dear
                            Maclagan,<lb/>
<lb/>
 The American dealer, Gabriel Wells, recently bought
                            the palette used by Blake during the brief period when he used oils. He
                            put it in an exhibition at the Burlington F.A.C. where it attracted a
                            good deal of attention (tho’ relics of this kind do not excite me
                            much!) It seems to have a good pedigree.<lb/>
 Wells has now gone back to
                            the U.S.A., and wishing to give the object to some public institution,
                            has left it to my discretion.<lb/>
 The Vict. &amp; Albert seemed to me
                            to be the best place, tho’ Binyon suggests that the London Museum
                            might also have a claim. Would you express an opinion? It can go to the
                            Vict. &amp; Albert if you wish.<lb/>
<lb/>
 Yours sincerely<lb/>

                        earlier, the V&amp;A had displayed the spectacles and etching needle of

          <p>The palette, not in the catalogue, was evidently a late addition to the 1927

                        dealer Francis Harvey, who handled numerous works by Blake during the 1860s,
                        including some from the studio sale of Frederick Tatham (1805-78), another
                        of the Ancients, who had inherited Blake’s studio contents from the

          <p>The palette (illus. 1-2) was received in a presentation case, today labeled
                        “Palette used by William Blake in 1780. Given by Mr. Gabriel

                        Street/1780.” Blake submitted his entry to the Royal Academy in 1780

          <p>It resembles oil paint, and because of the inscribed address it has always
                        been assumed to date from c. 1780, the brief period during Blake’s
                        training when he used oil, a medium he strongly criticized and therefore
                        avoided for the rest of his life. Analysis (table 1) confirmed that it
                        includes linseed oil in many colors, poppy oil in some, and a mixture of
                        these, or possibly walnut oil, in others. These oil types are typical of
                        artists’ oil paint, both hand ground in the late eighteenth and
                        earlier nineteenth centuries, and supplied in tubes

later in the nineteenth century. In this palette
                        the poppy oil, known to yellow less than linseed oil, was not strongly
                        associated with the white and blue paint that would have benefited most from
                        it. The variations in azelate/palmitate as well as oleate/stearate ratios
                        seen in the gas chromatography results probably stem from differential
                        drying of the paint, which was much thicker than would be found on a
                        painting. The results may also have been affected by pigment-medium
                        interactions such as the formation of zinc soaps, occasionally identified by
                        FTIR, as well as the possible addition of non-drying oils.</p>
          <p>At least one shade of yellow and one of orange lead chromate were identified
                        with optical microscopy, and supported by EDX and FTIR results. These could
                        not have been used by Blake or anyone else c. 1780. Yellow lead chromate
                        (chrome yellow) was patented in 1814, and a pale yellow shade has been found
                        in a Turner oil exhibited early that year, while the darker yellow and
                        orange shades were probably available only later, in the 1820s.<supplied

                        1834, the earlier variety being too transparent for the purpose.<supplied

          <p>The connection with Harvey implies that the palette was in existence by the
                        1860s, a period when Blake had a small following, and his work fetched
                        correspondingly low prices. Nevertheless, the possibility cannot be excluded
                        that it is a deliberate fraud, of mid-nineteenth-century date. If it has a
                        genuine connection to Blake, it could have been used by one of the Ancients,
                        who had acquired it from Blake’s widow, herself an artist. Our
                        limited analyses of the paint used by Richmond and Palmer have shown that,
                        like Blake himself, they used a mixture of animal glue and plant gums in
                        their paintings during his last years, in the 1820s.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n168" type="note">17</ref> Few of their later works have been analyzed, but a
                        Richmond self-portrait of 1853 is catalogued as in oil,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n169" type="note">18</ref> so their use of this medium is possible. The only
                        certain conclusion is that the paint on the palette could not have been used
                        by William Blake. <note id="n168">17. Townsend, ed., <hi rend="i">William
