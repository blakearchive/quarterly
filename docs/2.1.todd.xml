                <p>Ruthven Todd suggests: “The early facsimile of the <hi rend="u">Songs</hi> seems to be to
be the work of one of the Linnell boys, unless, and this is pure guessing, it was made by Tatham for his own
use. He is the only one of the Ancients who would fit in, and, on second thoughts, the Linnells were much more
competent. Tommy Butts was out of the picture by 1821. . . . In addition, the engraving of the old man’s
head on the verso of the fragment of <hi rend="u">America</hi> copper-plate suggests that Tommy was just a
little more competent than the description would suggest. My only other suggestion would be to look into the
Wilkinson family. Did he have daughters? He was enough of an enthusiast to have set a member of his family to
work. As for the date of the paper, 1821, that doesn’t matter except as a date showing the work to have been
done later.”</p>
                <p>Do any readers know of other contemporary or near-contemporary Blake facsimiles?</p>
