                    <p>“Half-a-dozen of William Blake’s finest works, which did belong to his wife, will
attract attention by reason of their quaintness and beauty. They bear the date 1793.” On 20 September 1878,
<hi rend="i">The Cambrian</hi> reported these items in its list of 155 prints, drawings and watercolours in
the newly opened J. Deffett Francis Art Gallery. Below, in the main reading room of the Swansea Public
Library, were 4,000 volumes from the same benefactor.</p>
                    <pb id="p03-53" n="53"/>
                    <p>In 1834, at the age of 19, Francis left Swansea to pursue a successful painting career
in London. He immediately befriended Frederick Tatham, from whom he acquired a number of Blake’s works.
Francis knew Tatham well enough to identify him as “the man with the umbrella”, subject of Haydon’s painting
“Waiting for the <hi rend="i">Times</hi>”, and to qualify W.M. Rossetti’s statement that “Swedenborgians,
Irvingites, and other extreme sectaries, beset the then youthful custodian of these precious relics [Blake’s
manuscripts] and persuaded him to make a holocaust of them.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n8" type="note">1</ref> In the margin of his copy of Rossetti’s edition of Blake, Francis, a
bachelor, sardonically commented: “Fredk. Tatham. Why he was a married man! Old enough to leave Sculpture for
Water Col[ou]r portraiture”; but he underlined “Irvingites”, affirming that it was this sect in particular
which had spurred Tatham to a mass burning of Blake’s writings.

                    </p>
                    <p>When Tatham sold the remains of his Blake collection in 1862, many of the miscellaneous
drawings were purchased by Mr. Harvey, who seems to have been a dealer. Some of these drawings, listed as
Harvey’s by W.M. Rossetti in the 1863 edition of Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life of Blake</hi>, appear to be
among those given by Francis to the British Museum.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n9"
type="note">2</ref> As Francis was not mentioned in Rossetti’s list of owners, it is probable that prior to
1863 the two collectors did not know one another; however, from presentation autographs in Francis’s
library, it is apparent that by 1865 he was acquainted with Thomas Woolner, Dante Gabriel and W.M. Rossetti,
and that they knew him as a collector.

                    <p>John Deffett Francis’s donations to the British Museum are recorded in detail in the
manuscript ‘Print Room Register’. On 8 November 1873, he deposited 98 items including 7 pencil drawings by
Blake. At 58 Francis was planning his retirement from London, and on his return to Swansea in 1876 he gave the
town his library and most of those art works he still possessed. In 1875 he sent W.M. Rossetti the “Woe cried
the muse” manuscript, to which Rossetti responded with a copy of <hi rend="i">Leaves of Grass</hi> newly
autographed by Whitman, and by 1878 he had donated to the British Museum Print Room some 1,500 pieces,
including 60 executed by Blake. In that year the Swansea Public Library, incorporating the Francis Gallery,
was reopened, <hi rend="i">The Cambrian</hi> duly recording the proceedings. Francis was appointed Honorary
Curator, and in 1890 he printed a catalogue which listed the Blakes as “61-6 America: a Prophecy”, “67 ‘He
descended into Hell’”, and “68 Michael Angelo (Buonarroti)”.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n10" type="note">3</ref> Before he died in 1901 Francis had given 8,000 books and 2,500 works of art
to the town of Swansea. The library was general enough to be useful, but the prints, drawings, engravings and
watercolours, selected by Francis to instruct in method as well as to please the eye, were too sophisticated
to have popular appeal, and sunk into storage and oblivion.

                    <p>In 1913 the Blakes were included in a limited exhibition as numbers 557: “MICHAEL

“Michael Angelo” is a trimmed and mounted engraving made
<pb id="p03-54" n="54"/>
for Fuseli’s <hi rend="i">Lectures on Painting</hi>, 1801. “He descended into Hell” is a misnomer for the
top design, trimmed and mounted, of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi>, plate 35, printed in reddish-brown
ink.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n12" type="note">5</ref> Unfortunately, the lower
two-thirds of this plate has not been preserved, and as this fragment is stuck to its mounting its verso
cannot be examined. The title given by Francis may be a misconstruction of the last line of text on plate 35:
“So spoke the voice from the Furnaces, descending into Non-Entity”. The six plates called “America: a
Prophecy” are <hi rend="i">America</hi>, plates ii, 3, and 13; and <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, plates 3, 4, and
9. These plates exhibit no textual variants from known copies, but <hi rend="i">America</hi>, ii and 3 are
unique as loose proofs. All are printed in reddishbrown ink, but very lightly, and the versos are uniformly
blank. <hi rend="i">America</hi>, ii, is the title-page and source of <hi rend="i">The Cambrian’s</hi>
reported date, 1793; <hi rend="i">America</hi>, 3, contains the only watermark, “J WHATMAN 1831”, indicating
posthumous printing. Francis has autographed the verso of <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>, 3, and given the date of
acquisition: “J Deffett Francis 1834”. Five of the plates are the normal 24 × 17 cm., but 
<hi rend="i">America</hi>, 13, is 24 × 17·6 cm. Unlike many of the British Museum holdings, none of the Swansea
Blakes has been signed by the familiar “FT”, Frederick Tatham, but they are embossed with the recognized
collector’s seal of their owner, John Deffett Francis.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n13"
