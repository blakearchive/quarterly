 the conversation of “Visionary forms dramatic” that Blake envisions in 
humanity’s future (<em>Jerusalem</em> 98, E 257). The first centers on 
ideological or intellectual conflict as an aspect of pluralistic 
harmony: Blake, the editors say, imagines “the kind of community that 
arises from the communication between differences” (4). A second, more 
mundane, type of conflict involves Blake’s contentious “relationships 
with his precursors and precursor texts,” and these too, for the 
editors, are relationships among “Contraries,” so that conflict emerges 
as a “risk inherent in fully engaging with the other” (4, 5). This 
breakdown, however, only partly accounts for the volume’s contents; more
 than half the essays involve “conflict” with recent views of Blake or 
Blake-like ideas as complicit with imperialism and its ideological 
categories, with elite political domination, or with masculinist gender 
conceptions. These essays suggest a turn away from a “complicit” Blake 
by at least some now working in the field.</td>

      <td class="paranumber">3</td>
      <td class="body">Blake’s involvement with burgeoning nationalist 
or imperialist ideas has been argued by several recent interpreters, 
including Julia M. Wright (<em>Blake, Nationalism, and the Politics of Alienation</em>, 2004), Edward Larrissy (“Blake’s Orient,” <em>Romanticism</em>, 2005), and Steve Clark (“<em>Jerusalem</em> as Imperial Prophecy,” <em>Blake, Nation and Empire</em>,
 ed. Clark and Worrall, 2006). The first two essays in the present 
volume, by Saree Makdisi and Angus Whitehead, address Larrissy’s 
arguments, which themselves critiqued Makdisi’s earlier work. Larrissy 
argued, among other points, that Blake’s reference to the Qur’an as a 
“loose Bible” in <em>The Song of Los</em> (3.29, E 67) incorporates orientalist notions of Islamic licentiousness and that the <em>Descriptive Catalogue</em>’s
 discussion of art in “the ancient republics, monarchies, and 
patriarchates of Asia” (E 531) typifies Blake’s limited and eurocentric 
knowledge of the East. Makdisi counters that Blake refused orientalism’s
 elevation of assumed Western self-control over Eastern license and that
 his references to Asian art, if inexact, evince a plural conception of 
Europe’s cultural heritage (14-16, 23-24). More broadly, he uses G. A. 
Rosso’s “The Religion of Empire: Blake’s Rahab in Its Biblical Contexts”
 (<em>Prophetic Character</em>, ed. Gourlay, 2002) as a springboard to 
argue that Blake’s late work remains oppositional toward empire (20-21, 
25). Though perhaps overly defensive in trying to clear Blake of any 
involvement in orientalism, Makdisi is right in my view to insist that 
Blake’s thrust is against both the structures of empire and the 
psychic-moral formations that bolster them.</td>

      <td class="body">Whitehead’s “‘A wise tale of the Mahometans’: 
Blake and Islam, 1819–26” uses three specifics—Blake’s reference to a 
“wise tale of the Mahometans” in conversation with Crabb Robinson, his 
“Visionary Head” of “Mahomet,” and his illustration to the Muhammad–Ali 
meeting in <em>Inferno</em> canto 28—as evidence that Blake shows “a 
positive engagement with Islam” in a period when “this religious faith 
was still regarded by many in Britain as ‘the Devil’s Methodism’” (32, 
quoting an 1828 magazine reference). Whitehead, like Makdisi, positions 
his essay as a response to Larrissy’s (29-30). Despite some questionable
 interpretations, the overall point that these late portrayals avoid any
 sort of denigration of Islam both extends Makdisi’s argument and 
provides independently valuable insight into Blake’s religious 
latitudinarianism.</td>

      <td class="paranumber">5</td>
      <td class="body">In “Blake, the Female Prophet and the American 
Agent: The Evidence of the 1789 Swedenborg Conference Attendance List,” 
David Worrall takes up the issue of complicity with emerging imperialism
 in one of Blake’s milieus. His stated purpose is archival, to identify 
as many as possible of the conference participants (48), and his modest 
conclusion is that contacts with some of them may have influenced 
Blake’s later choices of topics and approaches (61). For example, 
meeting Dorothy Gott, the prophet of Worrall’s title, could have spurred
 Blake’s adoption of prophetic speech modes. Implicitly, Worrall is also
 working to rescue the relative social radicalism of central 
Swedenborgian figures from views that associate them with commercial 
penetration in Africa and land speculation in the United States, as 
argued by Deirdre Coleman (see Worrall’s note 18). He does this by 
distinguishing some participants who played such a role, such as the 
partners in US land dealings Colborn Barrell and Henry Servanté, from 
the leading Swedenborgians Carl Wadström and Augustus Nordenskjöld, who 
Worrall feels had more disinterested religious motives (52-57). 
Particularly valuable is Worrall’s recognition of the autonomy of 
religious motivation, its nonreducibility to material interests, and the
 consequent pluralism within dissenting traditions, a point relevant to 
Blake, who, Worrall speculates, could have known of the Moravians’ work 
on the US frontier “with the native North Americans imminently 
threatened by Barrell and Servanté” (60).</td>

      <td class="body">This pluralism is Mee’s topic in “‘A Little Less 
Conversation, A Little More Action’: Mutuality, Converse and Mental 
Fight,” which responds to criticisms by David Simpson of “conversation” 
as a model for social change (126). Simpson doesn’t discuss Blake, but 
Mee takes on his ideas by using Blake to exemplify a different idea of 
“conversation” from Simpson’s. Mee distinguishes between relatively 
distinct “conversations” in the 1780s and 90s, a polite kind that the 
salons of the Mathew circle may have typified, and one stressing 
“candour” over politeness, favored by Mary Hays, Godwin, and others 
sharing a “tradition of Dissent apt to think ‘collision’ and conflict as
 part of any genuine conversational encounter” (127). Mee thinks that 
this idea lies behind Blake’s “Visionary forms dramatic” passage and 
that Blake “radicalizes the polite vision of conversation” to produce a 
“more conflictual model” in tune with radical ideas of change (127, 
139).</td>

    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">7</td>
      <td class="body">Mee’s emphasis is not new for him—he has been excavating radical, plebeian forms of conversation since his first book, <em>Dangerous Enthusiasm </em>(1992). His polemical purpose here becomes clearer when one looks at the Simpson essays in <em>Raritan</em> and <em>New Left Review</em>
 that he criticizes. Simpson’s idea is that polite models of 
conversation play into the hands of elites who decide what is acceptable
 subject matter. But additionally, I suspect Mee is reacting to 
implications in some Marxist and post-Marxist political writing that 
downplay the need for open political debate as part of radical culture. 
Simpson, for example, deprecates a current idea of conversation as 
“open, undecided, welcoming, antifoundational, and minimally 
teleological” (“The Cult of ‘Conversation,’” <em>Raritan</em>, 1997). 
This implies preference for discourse that is decided, foundational, 
teleological, and so on, terms that tend to exclude free-ranging debate.
 Marxism classically, and to some extent still, assumes that 
oppositional consciousness derives univocally from its own assumedly 
scientific method and that all views except its own ultimately represent
 the ideas of opposing classes. (For a classic statement, see the essays
 in Georg Lukács’s 1923 <em>History and Class Consciousness</em>.) This 
is an issue of course with resonance in the history of twentieth-century
 totalitarianism. It is one, too, with relevance for Blake, since some 
interpreters, such as Makdisi in his “Blake and the Communist Tradition”
 (<em>Palgrave Advances in William Blake Studies</em>, ed. Williams, 
2006), have argued for Blake’s continuity with Marxism. Reviewing that 
volume in these pages, Jason Whittaker argued that “alternative 
traditions of later communist thinking … espoused a view of 
anti-authoritarian communism that often appears closer to Blake than 
Marxism does” (<em>Blake</em> 44.2 [fall 2010]: 74), and I urged a similar view in my own <em>The Chained Boy: Orc and Blake’s Idea of Revolution</em>
 (1999). Mee’s historicizing of “conversation” as including vigorous 
debate and ideological confrontation seems, implicitly, also to argue 
for the multivoiced character of radical opposition and for placing 
Blake, as Whittaker does, in a more open tradition than that of Marxism.</td>

      <td class="body">Besides these discussions of overall social 
ideology, essays by Susan Matthews and David Fallon target Anne Mellor 
and others who assert Blake’s entrapment in and replication of dominant 
gender paradigms. Matthews’s “Impurity of Diction: The ‘Harlots Curse’ 
and Dirty Words,” while accepting that Blake cannot totally escape these
 paradigms, argues for the “transformative power” of his writing in 
“London,” based “not on the ability of poetry to cleanse but to bring to
 the surface and to refigure meanings” (66). Detailing 
eighteenth-century debates about prostitution, Matthews urges that the 
poem critiques “the evangelical account of prostitution” and prefigures 
later Blake works that present women’s sexuality as socially 
transformative (74, 79-80). Fallon’s “‘She Cuts his Heart Out at his 
Side’: Blake, Christianity and Political Virtue” examines Blake’s 
relation to the “civic humanism” tradition, arguing that he gradually 
reworks its “republican masculinism.” Fallon’s key texts, “The Mental 
Traveller,” the annotations to Bacon, and “I Saw a Monk of Charlemaine,”
 persuade him that for later Blake, “male-oriented classical civic 
virtue is seriously flawed,” especially by militarism, and “women [are] 
essential to a liberatory renewal of the social body” (101).</td>

contemporaries. Haggarty’s “From Donation to Demand? Almsgiving and the 
‘Annotations to Thornton’” and Erle’s “Shadows in the Cave: Refocusing 
Vision in Blake’s Creation Myth” focus respectively on Blake’s indignant
 response to Robert Thornton’s 1827 version of the Lord’s Prayer and on <em>The Book of Urizen</em>’s
 use of eighteenth-century optics and ophthalmology. Haggarty valuably 
contextualizes Thornton’s work among contemporary writings on charity 
and suggests that by insisting that bread is ours by right, Blake in old
 age sustains the radicalism of his youth (107). Erle reads the creation
 of the senses in <em>Urizen</em> as influenced by then-current optic theory, including findings on the lens’s active role in vision. Her further argument that <em>Urizen</em> counters Swedenborg’s account of distinct spiritual and material realms by “adapt[ing] optic theory to explain the <em>visible</em>
 existence of the spiritual world” (152) is weakened by failure to 
discuss the Eternals’ “tent” erected to block vision between these 
realms (<em>Urizen</em> 19.2-20.2, E 78-80). Nonetheless, this essay 
resituates Blake in a way that counters still-resonant ideas of his 
opposition to science.</td>

      <td class="body">Crosby, Calè, and Paley focus closely on Blake 
and art. In “A Minute Skirmish: Blake, Hayley and the Art of Miniature 
Painting,” Crosby examines Blake’s use of stippling in miniatures done 
for Hayley, arguing that these works violate models that Hayley 
recommended and so are a first step in Blake’s rejection of his patron. 
Calè’s “Blake and the Literary Galleries” seeks parallels between <em>Urizen</em> and <em>Night Thoughts</em> and Fuseli’s Milton illustrations, notably <em>Satan Bursts from Chaos</em>. Calè does demonstrate parallels (most convincingly with <em>Urizen</em>),
 but her larger argument that both Blake works show the sequential 
indeterminacy associated with gallery browsing is overstated. Paley’s 
“Blake’s Poems on Art and Artists,” which ends the volume, opens new 
ground, given the lack of much previous analysis of these angry Notebook
 poems (“To Venetian Artists,” “Florentine Ingratitude,” and others). 
Paley proposes that the Orléans sale of French, Italian, and Spanish art
 in 1798 was “a major impetus” for the poems (210); he doesn’t provide 
evidence but expertly decodes the works and shows their relevance to 
Blake’s annotations of Reynolds, long accepted as major statements of 
his ideas on art.</td>

      <td class="body">One relevant sense of conflict not addressed in 
the volume, curiously, is Blake’s representations of social conflicts, 
whether the European war—highlighted in the editors’ first sentence but 
not discussed by any contributor—or the war at home. Issues still 
needing discussion, in my view, include Blake’s possible sanctioning of 
social violence in both early and later work (<em>Europe</em> 15, <em>Milton </em>42), his attention to poverty and growing rebellion during the Regency (<em>Milton</em> 18, <em>Jerusalem </em>60),
 and his sense that social war trumps international war—“The Wine-press 
on the Rhine groans loud, but all its central beams / Act more terrific 
in the central Cities of the Nations / Where Human Thought is crushd 
beneath the iron hand of Power” (<em>Milton </em>25.3-5, E 121). But one
 essay collection can’t do everything, and this one does a great deal 
both to extend knowledge of Blake’s intellectual and historical contexts
 and, in the polemical essays, to sustain an ongoing debate over his 
complicity with or defiance of ideologies of oppression.</td>
