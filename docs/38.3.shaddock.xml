<lb/>
To Nobodaddy<lb/>
<lb/>
He slept on his bed of shredded printouts more than fifteen years<lb/>
After the Great Bear was slain. His triumph brief, he found himself<lb/>
Shunted aside as liberals gloated and fornicated in the Holy Temple,<lb/>
Where he alone had presided, where the sacred codes and secret pulses<lb/>
From his vast network were downloaded, life-sustaining they were to him,<lb/>
And without them he took to his bed and dreamed incessantly of Return,<lb/>
While Dodd and his ilk grew emboldened and wove chains of regulation<lb/>
Round his comatose-seeming torso. Beneath this deceptive slumber<lb/>
Abstract Reason wove fantastic gambits in his brain, and when the Towers’<lb/>
Crashing (foretold it was in a dream) woke him he had ready<lb/>
New Orders, alive with power he drew from the Vault,<lb/>
Constant Strife there would be, and crushing Control of the Imagination,<lb/>
And Ashcroft his henchman rose like a statue on the hydraulic dais to proclaim them.<lb/>
