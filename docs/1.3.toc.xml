                    Number 3<lb/>
                    December 15, 1967<lb/>
                    Damoniana<lb/>
                    This issue of the BLAKE NEWSLETTER is dedicated to Professor S. Foster<lb/>
                    Damon, whom we delight to honor in anticipation of his seventy-fifth<lb/>
                    birthday.<lb/>
                    A more substantial and permanent tribute to Professor Damon is being pre-<lb/>
                    pared by Professor Alvin Rosenfeld of Brown University.  It is an anthology<lb/>
                    of original essays on Blake to be published as a <hi rend="u">Festschrift</hi>
entitled<lb/>
                    <hi rend="u">William</hi> <hi rend="u">Blake:</hi> <hi rend="u">Essays</hi> 
<hi rend="u">For</hi> <hi rend="u">S.</hi> <hi rend="u">Foster</hi> <hi rend="u">Damon</hi>.  It will include some
two dozen<lb/>
                    essays on Blake’s poetry and painting, written for the occasion by many of<lb/>
                    the world’s leading Blake scholars; an introductory essay on S. Foster Damon<lb/>
                    by Malcolm Cowley; and, as an appendix, a full bibliography of Professor<lb/>
                    Damon’s writings.  It will also include numerous plates of Blake’s designs.<lb/>
                    A further announcement about the <hi rend="u">Festschrift</hi>, including details about
its<lb/>
                    contents and date of publication, will appear in the next NEWSLETTER.
                    A celebration of Professor Damon’s birthday will take place at Brown on<lb/>
                    February 22-23.  The festivities will include a reading of his poetry, a<lb/>
                    performance of scenes from his prize-winning play <hi rend="u">Witch</hi> 
<hi rend="u">of</hi> <hi rend="u">Dogtown</hi>,<lb/>
                    and possibly a small concert of his music.  An informal seminar will be<lb/>
                    conducted by Professors Harold Bloom and Geoffrey Hartman, and an exhibit<lb/>
                    of Blake items and Damoniana will be shown at Brown’s Rockefeller Library<lb/>
                    (Feb. 15 - March 15).  All these programs have been arranged by Alvin<lb/>
                    Rosenfeld.<lb/>
                    It’s difficult to find words adequate to someone who is at the same<lb/>
                    time a great pioneer and an energetic contemporary.  May Foster Damon’s<lb/>
                    wisdom, enthusiasm, wit and versatility long continue to astonish us!<lb/>

to us that we copyright the NEWSLETTER in order to protect ourselves and our contributors from the possibility
of its being reprinted without our permission at some future time. Reprint companies seem to have become
active even in rather remote fields of scholarship, and it does seem to me that if the NEWSLETTER ever should
be reprinted, it should realize some of the benefits. (It would be nice to have an occasional photographic
reproduction, for example. I promise not to abscond to Golgonooza with the profits.) Writers of articles are
of course free to use their material elsewhere.</note>
