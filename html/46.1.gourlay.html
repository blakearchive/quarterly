        <div id="text">
<p>This book is an intellectual and critical gem that is also a great 
bargain. As an edition of a classic collection of challenging poems for 
use by serious but not necessarily expert readers, it is as successful 
as Stephen Booth’s classic facsimile and critical edition of <em>Shakespeare’s Sonnets</em>
 (Yale, 1977). Essick provides a foundation of perspicacious 
historicist/materialist contextual and critical analysis, drawing upon 
(without getting bogged down in) more than two centuries of Blake 
scholarship; the critical apparatus as a whole promotes a sophisticated 
appreciation of the contrary states of the human soul while gently 
steering modern readers, innocent and experienced, around the 
accumulated obstacles to subtle understanding of these poems and their 
illuminations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The edition begins with full-size color reproductions of all but one 
of the pages now present in the Huntington Library’s handsome copy E of <em>Songs, </em>which
 Blake assembled for Thomas Butts from leaves printed at various times 
in various colored printing inks, plus three additional pages:&nbsp;“The
 Clod and the Pebble,” from the Huntington’s copy N (substituting for 
the crudely finished posthumous impression of this plate that was added 
to copy E), the uncolored “A Divine Image” (actually present only in 
copy BB), and the tailpiece from copy C, a page omitted from all but a 
few early&nbsp;copies of <em>Songs</em>. The recto/verso printing of the
 pages Blake had at hand when he assembled copy E entailed some further 
compromises on his part—“Laughing Song” appears in both <em>Innocence </em>and<em> Experience</em>, and the “Nurses Song” in <em>Experience</em> is effectively salvaged from an accidental double impression in order to make use of the print on the opposite side.</p>
<p>As facsimiles of Blake’s pages the reproductions are not completely 
successful: the original pages of copy E are matte, for one thing, and 
these reproductions are all printed on glossy paper, with what appears 
to be a glossier finish on top (or perhaps just glossy ink). In a note 
of corrigenda (<em>Blake</em> 42.3 [winter 2008-09]: 111), Essick 
acknowledges that despite elaborate measures by the imaging and printing
 team, the reproductions do not accurately represent the tone of the 
paper on which Blake’s images were printed—the background is “too brown,
 with a slight rosy hue,” with a result that is occasionally reminiscent
 of what used to be called flesh-colored bandages. The only page on 
which the tone of the paper is accurate, reports Essick, is “The Tyger,”
 which is unfortunate in another way, since in that case the original 
background has been sunned so badly that the paper tone in the glossy 
reproduction approximates a varnished stationer’s bag; I think it would 
have been forgivable in a non-archival facsimile like this one to have 
manipulated the image digitally to undo or at least minimize the sun 
damage, which has as little to do with Blake’s intentions for copy E as 
the posthumous “Clod and the Pebble” leaf that Essick judiciously 
replaced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite these problems, the colors of Blake’s images appear to be 
considerably truer here than in most reproductions by offset 
lithography, and the details are very sharp; I have not seen these 
reproductions side by side with the originals, but they look right.  
Copy E is a fine middle-period copy, despite its somewhat heterogeneous 
constituents, and its rough edges reveal things about Blake’s publishing
 and printing that are obscured by more polished copies. Further, it is 
good to have printed images of its pages to compare with those of 
better-known, more elaborate late copies such as Z (Library of Congress;
 Blake Trust/Orion/Oxford) or W (King’s College; Princeton/Blake Trust).
 The luminous, zoomable digital images of most copies in the <em>William Blake Archive</em> &lt;﻿<a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/" target="_blank">http://www.blakearchive.org</a>﻿&gt;
 are both magnificent and immensely useful, but there’s still a place 
for reading and comparing paper-based images of Blake’s works. Indeed, 
this facsimile is much more successful in one respect than most <em>Songs</em>
 editions in color: Blake’s careful reinforcement in ink of many of the 
original printed texts in this copy and the overall sharpness of the 
images in this edition make it possible to read almost all the poems in 
the facsimile pages with only a little strain, so that readers can 
experience text and image together, as Essick recommends and Blake 
intended.</p>
<p>The general introduction efficiently and clearly covers the 
potentially controversial matter of Blake’s unique publishing techniques
 without gratuitously venturing into the disputed territory that lies 
there, outlines the intellectual and historical contexts that are most 
relevant, and locates in Blake’s biography the distinguishable but 
overlapping projects of writing, printing, and issuing the copies of the
 <em>Songs</em> as finished works.  A general account of the development of the <em>Innocence</em>
 poems follows, once again placing them in broad cultural and historical
 contexts and then more immediate ones.  Essick outlines the rhetoric 
and ideology of Innocence and then explains the complex binary of 
Innocence and Experience that emerged from the original project: "just 
as Blake’s innocence is not heaven, or even Eden, his state of 
experience is not hell. Both are visions of our own world seen from 
fundamentally different yet interconnected perspectives. Experience 
reverses or parodies (in a non-comic fashion) the core habits of mind 
and themes of its contrary state” (16).</p>
<p>The commentaries upon the individual poems address both illustrations
 and text efficiently and fairly thoroughly, thoroughly enough that when
 this edition first appeared I was a little reluctant to use it with 
beginning readers of Blake. I worried that such comprehensive and 
authoritative discussion of the major issues in each poem would leave 
little for students to discover for themselves.  Instead, the commentary
 usually has the opposite effect; far from being inhibited by Essick’s 
impressively learned guidance, students respond to the lucidity and 
cogency of his readings with lucid, cogent insights of their own. The 
great David V. Erdman’s <em>The Illuminated Blake</em> 
(Anchor–Doubleday, 1974), by contrast, is even more thorough in its own 
way, and even more open-ended in its analysis, but when students emulate
 it they tend to absorb its weaknesses rather than its strengths, 
confounding stray minutiae with minute particulars.</p>
<p></p><div class="image"><img src="424.jpg" alt="Frontispiece of Aphorisms on Man" height="322" width="200"><div>Frontispiece of <em>Aphorisms on Man</em>, 2nd ed. (author’s collection).</div></div>In
 general this edition is more oriented toward literary than visual-arts 
interests. Although Essick’s knowledge of Blake’s art-historical 
contexts rivals that of anyone in the business, he is more likely to 
adduce an extra-Blakean text in his commentary than a picture by another
 artist. I teach Blake to art and design students, who need to know 
about literary analogues as much as anyone, but they engage Blake’s 
composite art most energetically when they see, for instance, the 
frontispiece to <em>Innocence</em> (and consider its poetic “Introduction”) in conjunction with Blake’s 1788 engraving after Fuseli for Lavater’s <em>Aphorisms on Man</em>.
 It may be, however, that the critical apparatus that would be necessary
 to help less visually oriented readers to negotiate the pictorial 
languages of the <em>Songs </em>would be so voluminous as to be 
impractical. As it is, reference to specific contextual material of all 
kinds is limited, and the literary analogues that are quoted tend to be 
texts that enlighten readers in relatively straightforward ways: thus 
Wesley’s hymn for children “Gentle Jesus, Meek and Mild” is cited in the
 discussion of “The Lamb,” but Matthew Prior’s “A True Maid,” in which 
leering Dick inquires about the health of a young woman named Rose, is 
not mentioned in connection with “The Sick Rose,” though it is strongly 
(if rather obliquely) resonant with it and as surely known to both Blake
 and much of his original audience as Wesley’s hymn.
<p>The typographic texts that accompany each commentary are, at least 
theoretically, punctuated (and paginated) as in the pages reproduced. 
Some might argue that rigorous adherence to the punctuational vagaries 
of this particular copy is inappropriate in an edition intended for 
general readers, since the marks that appear in this copy are so 
unconventional that they provide little help for those having trouble 
parsing Blake’s poetic diction, and the unique punctuation of copy E 
does not appear to reflect concerted authorial intention. In this 
instance I believe that Essick is correct in minimizing intervention. An
 editor of an illuminated Blake text who supplies punctuation along 
conventional lines risks obscuring ambiguities that students can 
fruitfully explore, and in an edition of a particular copy of a 
particular illuminated book there is little point in concocting a 
super-text based on principled extrapolation from all copies, as Erdman 
did in his editions of the poetry and prose. Essick sensibly follows the
 practice of the <em>Blake Archive</em>, which aspires to reproduce and 
transcribe all copies of the illuminated books in all their individuated
 multifariousness. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the textual principle here corresponds to that of the archive, the
 practice diverges—even not intervening, it turns out, can take 
different paths and present thorny difficulties. Essick’s transcriptions
 differ in small ways from both those of the archive and, by my eyes, 
from the text as it appears in copy E. For instance, Essick’s 
transcription of “Infant Joy” omits the clearly formed if textually 
ambiguous dash-oids that the archive includes at the end of lines 2 and 
5, a decision unremarked in the textual notes. Because the pen-and-ink 
reinforcement of the printed texts in <em>Songs</em> E often goes beyond
 touching up to complete rewriting, it could be argued that the 
generally sparser punctuation in writing ink is more deliberate than the
 printed punctuation, which Blake often left so faint, as in “The 
Tyger,” that for reading purposes it isn’t there. But even Blake’s very 
deliberate-looking repunctuation in ink isn’t consistently more 
conventional or helpful than what it replaces, as in line 17 of the 
“Introduction” to <em>Innocence</em>, where a clearly printed comma is 
overwritten with a clear, and clearly unconventional, period in ink. In 
the end, though, I’m not sure it would have been very edifying if Essick
 had explained and adjudicated every punctuational crux that the text 
presents: his transcriptions are helpful and careful, and the 
reproductions of the pages are clear enough that readers can see for 
themselves how complex Blake’s punctuation can be.</p>
<p>If it should come to pass that the Huntington Library decides to 
offer a second edition of this fine book, I am not sure what I would 
recommend changing. The sturdy-seeming sewn hardcover costs only a few 
dollars more than the blurry paperback edition of copy Z now offered by 
Oxford, so a less expensive binding isn’t particularly pressing, even 
for classroom use (I am very taken with the double bookmark ribbons, one
 for <em>Innocence</em> and one for <em>Experience</em>, or one for 
image and one for commentary).  I would like to see the imaging and 
printing experts take another stab at rendering the background color of 
most pages more correctly, and tweaking “The Tyger” to lose its 
Hollywood tan, but I suspect that changing to a less glossy paper would 
endanger the accuracy of the color and the clarity that make this 
edition so satisfactory for reading. Let’s just hope it stays in print 
for a long time, in any form.&nbsp;</p>
