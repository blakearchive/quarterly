      <h1 align="center">The <em>Jerusalem </em>Marathon<br>
      The Abbey at Sutton Courtenay, 6-7 November 2004<br> 
       <br>
        By Susanne Sklar<br>
      Queen's College, Oxford</h1>
      <p class="style3">In the preface to <em>Jerusalem</em> Blake says he chooses the words in his poem to suit "the mouth of a true orator" (<em>Jerusalem </em>pl. 3).&nbsp; I think the poem is meant to be heard and seen.&nbsp; The Blake Society offered to endorse an overnight <em>Jerusalem</em>
 reading.&nbsp; My dissertation supervisor, Professor Christopher 
Rowland, agreed to be a "visionary form."&nbsp; I asked him to read 
Jesus. </p>
      <p class="style3"><span class="style2">My friend Barbara Vellacott (reading Vala) arranged that we could give voice to Jerusalem in the library of the 13th century <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060909184252/http://www.theabbey.ukcentre.com/mainhome.htm">Abbey at Sutton Courtenay</a>
 (about 15 miles from Oxford).&nbsp; Eleven people read in very 
comfortable armchairs and several commented upon the mullioned windows 
with their stained glass insets, caryatid angels supporting the ample 
mantlepiece, the warm fire, the tall bookcases.&nbsp; Philip Pullman, 
reading Albion, contributed good whisky to the event.&nbsp; Others 
brought biscuits, fruit, sparkling water, energy bars, strong coffee and
 tea.&nbsp; We knew this would be physically draining.&nbsp; We read the
 first three chapters of Jerusalem from just before 7 pm and on into the
 night.&nbsp; We divested ourselves of watches when Jerusalem began so 
we did not know how much after midnight it was when we walked through 
the dark gardens to the guest house.&nbsp; We seemed to be walking 
through the same doorways Los enters in the poem's frontispiece.&nbsp; 
Carrying torches, like Los' globe of light, we rose before dawn to begin
 chapter four.</span></p>
      <p class="style3"><span class="style2">This
 was not a performance.&nbsp; There was no audience, no illusion of 
"aesthetic distance."&nbsp; No one rehearsed beforehand, though most 
participants knew which character they would read.&nbsp; <em>Jerusalem</em>
 has seven main speaking parts (Jesus, Albion, Jerusalem, Vala, Los, 
Enitharmon, and the Spectre) as well as many minor roles contained in 
its choruses of Sons, Daughters, and Eternals/Cathedrals.&nbsp; The text
 is more than 60% narration and we each became members of that narrative
 body, sometimes individually reading paragraphs or phrases, sometimes 
reading in uni</span><span class="style4">son</span><span class="style2">,
 sometimes in counterpoint, especially when Israel gets mapped onto 
Britain.&nbsp; We echoed and whispered and shouted.&nbsp; Francis 
Gilbert, who embodied Eternals, observed that "we operated as One Body" 
when we each "passed the baton" of Blake to one another.&nbsp; Andrew 
Vernede, our Los, enjoyed the freedom to interrupt, to flow together; 
"we were borne up by voices," said Eleanor Lord, our Enitharmon, "like a
 choir."&nbsp; Philip Pullman (Albion) commented, "the flow of the poem 
was clarified and it came to life in Minute Particulars."</span></p>
      <p class="style3"><span class="style2">Occasionally
 Blake's words whirled, making more sound than sense.&nbsp; Several 
readers commented on how dissonance and sense work together when the 
poem is heard.&nbsp; Chris Rowland (Jesus) said that "the words pile up,
 as in some liturgical event.&nbsp;<em> Jerusalem</em> is to be 
experienced. . . ."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Such a poem should be read 
collectively," said Tony Eaude, who embodied Albion's Sons.&nbsp; Tim 
Heath (the Spectre) was struck by <em>Jerusalem</em>'s "clutter" and 
said that out of its clutter an image can clearly appear.&nbsp; He came 
away seeing that "there is a throne in every man . . . it is the throne 
of God."</span></p>
      <p class="style3"><span class="style2">Each
 reader came away with different images.&nbsp; Jane Parkinson (the 
Cathedral Cities) was most struck by how Los' anvil tempers "the harmony
 and cacophony."&nbsp; Chris Rowland (Jesus) saw "the image of the child
 leading the old man through London."&nbsp; Tony (the Sons) saw naked 
heroes, distorted, battling implacable forces.&nbsp; The poem speaks to 
different readers in very different ways. It cannot be tidily 
interpreted.</span></p>
      <p class="style3"><span class="style2">Francis
 Gilbert (Eternals), Barbara Vellacott (Vala), and I (Jerusalem) were 
particularly struck by the text's holisitic nature.&nbsp; As dawn 
filtered through the mullioned windows Francis noted that the many 
deaths, resurrections, and divisions came together in the Fourfold 
Vision.&nbsp; "I felt something like a resurrection in myself," he said,
 "and all the others made sense."</span></p>
      <p><span class="paragraph style3">I
 am in the second year of my theology D.Phil. at Queen's College.&nbsp; 
Guided by the goodness of Chris Rowland I have pored over <em>Jerusalem</em>'s
 minute particulars.&nbsp; Blake's Eternals say: "Expanding we behold as
 One. . . ."&nbsp; Giving the text to eleven voices expands it.&nbsp; 
Now <em>Jerusalem</em> is an organism of imagery, a vast speaking 
picture.&nbsp; The movement of heard words is like a mobius strip of 
Blake design.&nbsp; The poem tells a story, yet everything in it is 
always happening.&nbsp; Vala's shuttles sing in the sky; I see the 
mundane egg, woven and forged, the daughters whipped, their fury, the 
anvil and Los; a cycle of violence, love in a Lily; Jesus always 
is.&nbsp; Beulah wings morph into black dragon wings which become 
seraphim flames of ruby and gold.&nbsp; The lake of fire is living 
water.&nbsp; Ulro, Beulah, and Eden always are; they are ways of 
perceiving.&nbsp; Altering perception is especially important back home 
in America, whose altars (in Jerusalem's words) now "run with blood" as 
"Euphrates is red with blood" (<em>Jerusalem</em> 79:53-69).&nbsp; The 
poem presents a choice.&nbsp; Moral Virtue and Life grow on very 
different trees.&nbsp; "The arts of life they changed into the arts of 
death" can be changed again to arts of life.&nbsp;<em> Jerusalem</em> is a poem whose time has come.</span><span class="paragraph"><br>
