          <p>Blake’s name was invoked in a somewhat perverse context on 22 September 1974 during the Druid
celebration of the autumn equinox on Parliament Hill Fields in North London. The hyperborean revivalists in
question belong to the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids, a splinter group of the British Circle of the
Universal Bond, which claims descent from a meeting of British Druids supposedly organized at Primrose Hill in
1717 by John Toland. More surprisingly, the Order accords Blake a place on the roll of honor for its departed
chieftains, alongside John Aubrey, William Stukeley and Bulwer Lytton. A desire to appease conventional
religious opinion has robbed the ceremony of much of its pagan flavor, to the point where even the four
archangels are enlisted in the Druid cause. However, the fruits of the earth were duly presented to the Chief
Druid, who then returned them to the soil (or rather to the hands of onlooking children who disliked the idea
of waste); “Excalibur” was unsheathed for the pronouncement of peace on the four corners of the earth; two new
<corr type="emend">postulants</corr> were accepted into the Order; a poetry reading was given and, finally,
after a comprehensive blessing, the Druid banner, bearing a trilithon surmounted by a wheatsheaf, made its way
down the hill to the changing-rooms.</p>
