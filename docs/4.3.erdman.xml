                    </byline>
                    <p>Doubleday has signed me to prepare a large Anchor paperback to contain all Blake’s
Illuminated Works in monochromatic facsimile (plus the Job illustrations), with brief descriptive commentary
on each plate. The aim is a price under ten dollars, for a working handbook. But the photography is to be of
the best, and although each work will be reproduced in a single color, the plan calls for using as many as
five different Blakean colors for the different works. Trim size will be 7 ⅛ × 10 ¼ inches; 352 pages.
Nearly all the reproductions will be in exact size, with the smaller pictures sometimes doubled up two or more
on a page. There will probably be a very slight reduction of the largest plates, <hi rend="i">America . . .
Jerusalem.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The idea of trying to say what is going on in each illumination is, I realize, a mad
one, and I know I’ll need help. Suggestions about baffling details or whole pictures will be welcome. I
shall also welcome ideas as to which copies of particular works will reproduce best in one color. And if
anyone has a superb set of photographs of any Illuminated Work, that could be borrowed, I shall be happy to be
apprised.</p>
                    <p>Target date: spring (or fall) 1972 publication.</p>
                    <p>Reward for the best title suggestion. “Blake’s Illuminated Works Entire”?—“The
Canon of &amp;c &amp;c”—“All In One . . . ”? Hard to find the right words.</p>
