              <p>As I was walking among the fires of hell, or rather the University of Toronto Library
reference room stacks, delighted with the enjoyments of Genius, which to undergraduates look like torment and
insanity, I tried to collect some of their Proverbs from Aristotle’s <hi rend="i">Analytics</hi>, or rather
from <hi rend="i">Dissertation Abstracts International.</hi> But <hi rend="i">DAI</hi> had gone walkabout.</p>
              <p>How can an elephantine mass like <hi rend="i">DAI</hi>, many scores of volumes, go missing?
They couldn’t have gone far. I cast about in the neighborhood where they were last seen—and bumped into
the <hi rend="i">Guide to Indian Periodical Literature</hi> for 1964 to 2007. So that’s where all those
Indian scholars have been lurking all these years!</p>
              <p>Some of the Indian Blake scholars are well known, such as Piloo Nanavutty and A.A. Ansari,
but most are entirely unrecorded in Blake literature in the west.</p>
              <p>And the journals too are unfamiliar. <hi rend="i">Aligarh Critical Miscellany</hi> and 
<hi rend="i">Aligarh Journal of English Studies</hi>, both edited by Ansari, are well enough known—even in the
University of Toronto Library—and the <hi rend="i">Times of India</hi> is of course familiar to anyone who
has lived in India. But most of the rest are entirely new to me: <hi rend="i">Bulletin of the Ramakrishna
Mission Institute of Culture, Prabuddha Bharata, Journal of the University of the Maharaja Sayaji Rao
University of Baroda.</hi> And many journals have titles which do not hint that they are Indian, such as 
<hi rend="i">Journal of Literature and Aesthetics</hi> (Kerala) and <hi rend="i">Theosophist</hi> (Madras) and 
<hi rend="i">Literary Criterion</hi> (Mysore) and <hi rend="i">Thought.</hi> What a treasure house, a
bibliographer’s Tom Tiddler’s ground, picking up gold and silver at every turn of the page.</p>
              <p>And cheek by jowl with the <hi rend="i">Guide to Indian Periodical Literature</hi> were
hundreds of volumes of encyclopedias which I’d never seen before, in Portuguese and Swedish and Turkish and
Italian and German. I think they must have been resurrected from the stacks where they had been snoozing
quietly and inoffensively. I only looked at encyclopedias of more than 20 volumes and in scripts I could
read—those in Arabic and Hebrew are still undisturbed in their comfortable dust—but I was astonished by
how many there were and how many of them had heard of William Blake.</p>
              <p>But I never did find <hi rend="i">DAI.</hi> I think it’s become virtual.</p>
              <p>The foreign languages of Blake scholarship recorded here are Dutch (3), Flemish (6), French
(5), German (7), Hungarian (4), Italian (6), Japanese (19—plus 6 essays in English in Japanese journals),
Korean (4), Polish (1), Portuguese (1), Romanian (1), Russian (1), Spanish (6), Swedish (2), and Turkish
(1).</p>
              <p>There are 19 doctoral dissertations recorded here from the universities of California (Santa
Barbara), Duke, Emory, Glasgow, Leicester, Ohio State, Oxford, Rochester, Seoul, State University of New York
(Binghamton, Buffalo [2]), Tennessee, Tulsa, Ulster, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Vanderbilt, Warwick,
and Washington. Dissertations from outside North America and Britain are probably seriously underrepresented
here, particularly those from Japan and Korea.</p>

                  <hi rend="b">New Journals with Blake Essays</hi>
                </title>
              </head>
              <p>In dutifully checking for new Blake books in WorldCat, I discovered that it has a separate
listing of essays. There were 613 essays listed on William Blake, many of which have not been recorded before.
Numbers of these essays are for William Blakes who have nothing to do with the poet, such as a resident of
Tulsa, Oklahoma, and a settler in the Transvaal.</p>
              <p>However, a couple of score of the WorldCat essays are about William Blake the poet-artist. I
was chagrined to find so many which had been previously overlooked but relieved to observe that many of them
are in journals which had never before carried an article on Blake and are improbable as lodgings for a poet
or a painter.</p>
              <p>The journals which had never before been recorded in bibliographies of Blake—or at least in
<hi rend="i">BB, BBS</hi>, and “William Blake and His Circle” (1992-2007)—include <hi rend="i">ALAN
Review, American Journal of Psychiatry, Bulletin of the History of Medicine, Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory
Medicine, Comparative American Studies, Journal of Humanistic Psychology, Journal of Literary Semantics,
Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, Literature and Medicine, Month, New York State Journal of Medicine, Paper
Conservator, Psychoanalytic Review, Quadrant, Revue germanique internationale, Soho Annual, Topic</hi>, and
<hi rend="i">Transactions and Studies of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia.</hi></p>
              <p>Notice how many of these newly recorded journals are concerned with medicine or with
psychiatry. Plainly the nets cast for Blake studies have missed a rich—or fairly rich—hunting ground.</p>
              <p>There were extensive public celebrations of Blake’s anniversary. Probably the most
lastingly notable of these were two editions of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> published on the same day,
Blake’s 250th birthday.</p>

                  <hi rend="b">Blake’s Writings</hi>
                </title>
              </head>
              <p>The most exciting Blake discovery of the year was of eight previously unknown versions of
color prints finished in watercolors, with prints from <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel, The Marriage of Heaven
and Hell</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen.</hi> With them are 13 otherwise unknown lines of
text by Blake, including “Who shall set the Prisoners Free” on <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> pl. 16 and
“Fearless tho in Pain I travel on” on <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> pl. 23. Neither phrase appears in Blake’s
other surviving works.</p>
              <p>They probably came from “A Small Book of Designs” copy B. Copy A has 23 prints, including
<hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> pl. 16 and <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> pl. 23, with no inscriptions. Copy B, as we
previously knew it, had 11 prints (lacking <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> pl. 16 and <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> pl.
23). The newly discovered prints were probably printed, like the rest of the Small Book, about 1796; copy A
was “Printed for M<hi rend="s">r</hi> Humphry . . . a selection from the different Books of Such as could be
Printed without the Writing,” as Blake wrote to Dawson Turner on 9 June 1818.</p>
              <p>Apparently the newly discovered prints passed at Catherine Blake’s death in 1831 to
Frederick Tatham and then disappeared from public view, their very existence unknown, until they reappeared in
London in 2007 and were exhibited at the Tate November 2007-June 2008.</p>
              <p>Two original works by Blake changed hands under mysterious circumstances in 2007. 
<hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> (Y), which had been recorded as “on permanent deposit” in the
Wallraf-Richartz-Museum in Cologne since 1978 (<hi rend="i">BBS</hi> p. 120), turned out to have had only a
temporary residence there. The prints were withdrawn by the family of the donor/lender, and half(!) of them
were sold in 2007 to two different collectors. Such separation of works which Blake intended to keep together
is deplorable. The only plausible explanation for it which I can find is greed.</p>
              <p>Even more mysterious, though not so deplorable—indeed, not at all deplorable—is the
apparent sale of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> (N) by an unidentified vendor,
presumably the descendants of the Whitney family which once owned it, to an unidentified collection for more
than $2,000,000. The price, vendor, buyer, and indeed the identity of the work sold are merely rumors
circulating in the book world. Large prices expedite the circulation of such rumors.</p>
              <p>W. H. Stevenson’s venerable Longman edition of <hi rend="i">The Poems of William
Blake</hi>, first issued in 1971, has been revised with all its old major virtues—<hi rend="i">BB</hi> says
it “is extremely valuable for Stevenson’s voluminous annotations presenting ‘essential details of fact
and background.’” Major changes were made in the second edition of 1989 (<hi rend="i">BBS</hi> p. 161),
and in the third edition (2007) the headnotes and footnotes, “the heart and lungs of the edition,” have
been “scoured,” “revised,” and “rewritten”; they are humane, learned, and crucially informative.
This and the Norton edition of Blake, edited by M. L. Johnson and John E. Grant and now revised and reissued,
are the best comprehensive editions for the general reader, with a great deal of value for the most
sophisticated scholars and critics.</p>

              </head>
              <p>One of the more startling discoveries about Blake’s art recorded here was in fact made as
long ago as 1930. Blake’s designs surrounding and indeed penetrating his text have long been compared to the
techniques of medieval book illuminators, and occasionally attempts have been made to show that Blake was
consciously imitating such works. But before 1930, and indeed after 1930, no one had argued that Blake himself
actually made illuminations for medieval manuscripts or that he incorporated such illuminations literally into
his own works. In the <hi rend="i">Enciclopedia italiana di scienze, lettere ed arti</hi> (1930), Ernest de
Selincourt not only argues that Blake’s words can no more be separated from his designs than the perfume can
be separated from the rose, but he reproduces a medieval illuminated page which served as the “Frontespizio
del <hi rend="i">The Book of Thel</hi>” (see illus. 1). This is an astonishing discovery.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, perhaps de Selincourt was as surprised to find this illustration to his
article as I was.</p>

              <p>Tate Britain has an online catalogue, with reproductions, of its 168 Blakes.</p>
              <p>The most spectacular exhibition (August-November 2007) and catalogue were those of Dante
Rediscovered at the Wordsworth Trust’s Dove Cottage. The catalogue, by David Bindman, Stephen Hebron, and
Michael O’Neill, is very handsome, and both exhibition and catalogue were impressive. Of course Blake’s
watercolors were among the most spectacular works exhibited.</p>
              <p>In the long run, the exhibition of the newly discovered prints from Small Book of Designs (B)
will prove to be more important, but alas! there was no catalogue, and for full details we will have to wait
for the study of the new prints by Robin Hamlyn and Martin Butlin.</p>
              <p>Sotheby’s is at it again. Not content with having dispersed to the four winds the 19
watercolors for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> which had been kept together from 1805 to 2 May 2006, in
2007 they dispersed plates from <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> (Y) which had probably been kept together
even longer. Of course Sotheby’s is merely the agent; the true cultural vandals are the owners. The owners
are legally entitled to do as they like with their treasures—to bind them lovingly, to break them up, to
burn them. But one would like to think of the integrity of a book or a suite of drawings as being like the
integrity of a statue. The Vandals who carried off and dismembered Greek and Roman statues apparently didn’t
know any better, but their ignorance does not make them more lovable. How wonderful it would be to have the
Venus de Milo with arms or all the Blair drawings reunited.</p>
              <pb id="p42-6" n="6"/>
              <p>One hopes that the newly discovered prints from the Small Book of Designs (B), which have
been together for over two centuries, will go to a suitable home, like the Tate, rather than falling into the
dismembering hands of Sotheby’s.</p>

              <p>Two workhorses of Blake scholarship continue to labor in the vineyard: Robert N. Essick’s
“Blake in the Marketplace, 2006” and G. E. Bentley, Jr.’s “William Blake and His Circle” for 2006.
The former is by far the more exciting, recording sales in the millions of dollars, the appearance of
previously unknown works, and the rumors that fuel the marketplace. Sometimes rumor is all we have, as with
the hypothetical sale for over $2,000,000 of <hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</hi> (N) by an
unknown (but suspected) vendor to an unknown (but suspected) collector. In more prosaic cases we have
passionate collectors competing with one another, as when prints from <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> (Y)
were sold to Essick and Alan Parker, in each case the rival being the underbidder. For all the works offered
for sale, piquancy is added to the account by the knowledge that Essick himself is likely to compete for any
important work.</p>
              <p>Most of the really interesting items in “William Blake and His Circle” were first
recorded in “Blake in the Marketplace.” But in “William Blake and His Circle” one can find most of the
scholarship concerned with Blake, both current and retrospective. With each issue, I think I have recorded all
the work on Blake to date, and every year I find scores of works published in previous years which had not
been recorded. Sometimes the new works are in unfamiliar languages, such as Polish and Turkish, sometimes they
are in journals one would not ordinarily associate with Blake, such as <hi rend="i">Clinical Chemistry and
Laboratory Medicine</hi>, and sometimes they are published in countries sparsely represented before, such as
India. The record in “William Blake and His Circle” is far from complete, but it is far more comprehensive
than can be found elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Two particularly rewarding books about Blake were published in 2007. The first is Martin
Myrone’s <hi rend="i">The Blake Book</hi> in the new Tate series of Essential Artists. Myrone sets out to
place Blake in his artistic context and succeeds admirably. His method is to summarize the best scholarship
rather than to expand that scholarship himself. However, he indulges himself in a little speculation about the
relationship between Blake’s designs surrounding his poetical texts and the then-current fashion for
needlework samplers. This is an original insight well worth pursuing.</p>
              <p>A more original work is Robert Rix’s <hi rend="i">William Blake and the Cultures of Radical
Christianity.</hi> Rix has read a great many ill-known religious works by Blake’s contemporaries, and he
shows “the close integration [in the 1790s] of religious radicalism with socio-political ideas” (4).
“Blake’s antinomian and enthusiast ideas were . . . conceived in reaction to public debates” (25).
Blake’s reference in his annotations to Swedenborg’s <hi rend="i">Divine Love and Divine Wisdom</hi>
(1788) 429 to what “was asserted in the Society” was almost certainly written before April 1789, after
which time the standard reference was to the Church rather than the Society (Rix 49). Rix points out that
“it was their [Swedenborgians’] close ties to international Masonry that attracted the most hostile
commentaries” (85). The passage in <hi rend="i">Marriage</hi> about the man who “carried a monkey about
for a shew” alludes to the religious impostors referred to by Swedenborg who “carry . . . Apes, cloathed
like Men, . . . on Horseback, through a City, and puff them off as Noblemen, of ancient and honourable
Extractions” (Rix 123). And in passing he remarks that “Blake’s writings show no telltale signs of the
more distinctive traits of Moravian practice” (8), despite the fact that Blake’s mother was, for a time
before his birth, a Moravian.</p>
              <p>For a digital agnostic like myself, the most wonderful “virtual” book on Blake recorded
this year—indeed the only “virtual” book on Blake this year—is <hi rend="i">Digital Designs on
Blake</hi>, ed. Ron Broglio (2005). Its “MOO Space” and “MOOs and Blake’s <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>”
are irresistible involuntary invitations to frivolity.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n3"
type="note">3</ref>
	<note id="n3">3. It’s like Old McDonald’s Farm, with “here a MOO, there a MOO, everywhere a
MOO-MOO”—a cheap witticism debased to a footnote.</note></p>
              <p>Eugenie Freed’s essay in <hi rend="i">Women Reading William Blake</hi>, ed. Helen Bruder,
on “Blake’s Golden Chapel” poem from the Notebook,
<pb id="p42-7" n="7"/>
is very ingenious and rewarding. The serpent who forced open the doors of the chapel of gold and at the altar
“Vomit[ed] his poison out / On the bread &amp; on the wine” is taken to refer to the proposal that
Swedenborg’s newly founded New Jerusalem Church should have ordained priests. The vigor of Blake’s
response leaves little doubt as to which side he was on.</p>
              <p>In the same collection appears Mary Lynn Johnson’s learned essay on “Blake’s Mary and
Martha on the Mount of Olives: Questions on the Watercolour Illustrations of the Gospels.” Impressive
biblical scholarship is brought to bear most fruitfully, particularly upon Blake’s watercolor of “The Hymn
of Christ and the Apostles.”</p>
              <p>A third very rewarding essay in the volume is Heather O’Donoghue’s learned and persuasive
“Valkyries and Sibyls: Old Norse Voices of Female Authority in Blake’s Prophetic Books,” which shows how
eighteenth-century “representations of valkyries and sibyls” reappear in Blake’s work.</p>
              <p>One of the most original and rewarding essays is Hisao Ishizuka’s study of Blake and
Enlightenment “fibre medicine,”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n4" type="note">4</ref> a
worthy sequel to his analysis of Thel’s “green sickness.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n5" type="note">5</ref> He demonstrates that in Blake’s works fibres are the basic elements not only
of the body but of life:<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n6" type="note">6</ref> “Why wilt
thou Examine every little fibre of my soul[?]” (<hi rend="i">Vala</hi> p. 4, l. 30,

22), “fibres of love” (<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl. 4, l. 8), and even “fibres of Brotherhood” 
(<hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl. 30, l. 18, pl. 88, l. 14). The fibrous basis of Blake’s living universe derives
from Enlightenment medicine characteristically extended by “a spiritualized trend of Swedenborg’s idea of
a divine organ” (87). <note id="n4">4. See Ishizuka, “Enlightening the Fibre-Woven Body,” in Part VI,

              <p>Karen Mulhallen’s meticulously scholarly review in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> of the Folio
Society reproductions of Blake’s watercolors for Young’s <hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi> is an important
independent contribution to scholarship. I had taken the Folio Society work to be a real facsimile of
Blake’s watercolors. However, Mulhallen compared the huge Folio Society volumes with Blake’s 537
watercolors in the British Museum Department of Prints and Drawings, and her conclusions from the comparisons
are very disconcerting. “I found remarkable variations as to accuracy of color in the Folio edition
throughout the series. Some designs seem precise, others in coloring almost unrecognizable” (89).
<q>
The Department of Prints and Drawings reported to me that the British Museum itself had done the photography,
but the Folio Society came in and checked proofs against the originals. Perhaps it is impossible to expect a
check of every single page—certainly that was not done. . . . Scene after scene, page after page, has erased
pencil marks, figures, scenes, and postures. These are clear in the originals, but not always in the Folio
edition, nor are they remarked upon in Hamlyn’s commentary.
</q></p>
              <p>She also remarks that “the series . . . contains a real portrait gallery of Blake’s time,
including Pitt and Fox, the king and the prince regent, and even Napoleon [and Blake himself].” I hope that
we may see such methods and conclusions laid out at large in the near future.</p>
              <p>The essays by Mark Crosby (“‘The sweetest spot on earth’: Reconstructing Blake’s
Cottage at Felpham Sussex”) and Angus Whitehead (“The Arlington Court Picture: A Surviving Example of
William Blake’s Framing Practice”) in the <hi rend="i">British Art Journal</hi> are densely factual and
rewarding.</p>
              <p>The most lastingly valuable essay on Blake published in 2007 will prove to be Joseph
Viscomi’s “Blake’s ‘Annus Mirabilis’: The Productions of 1795” in <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, a
sequel to his “Blake’s Virtual Designs and Reconstruction of <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi>,” 
<hi rend="i">Romanticism on the Net</hi> (2006). The essay is important because it deals with the fundamental
units of Blake’s art. In it he demonstrates, with characteristic Viscomian flair, that:</p>
              <p>(1) <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> pls. 3-4 and 6-7, bearing the text of the poem, are
each etched on one piece of copper, wider than it is high and therefore unsuitable for book production. They
were printed by masking half the plate at a time. The “virtual” reproduction of pls. 3-4 shows at the join
a butterfly which is cut in half and therefore unidentifiable in the separate, masked prints. Apparently
“Blake reconstructed the text plates to salvage an experiment about which he had changed his mind” (60).
And he argues that the full-page designs of <hi rend="i">The Song of Los</hi> (pls. 1-2, 5, 8) are printed
from millboard, not from copper as had previously been assumed.</p>
              <p>(2) Tatham told Gilchrist that in his color prints Blake “painted roughly and quickly, so
that no colour would have time to dry” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>[2] 48). On the contrary, says Viscomi, “Blake
would not have had to work too quickly or worry too much if his colors dried to the touch on the support,
because he almost certainly printed on dampened paper, whose moisture would have reconstituted the colors”
(61).</p>
              <p>(3) The great color print of “God Judging Adam” is almost identical in size with “Satan
Exulting over Eve” and “Elohim Creating Adam,” suggesting “that one of these designs is on its recto
and the other on a copper sheet acquired at the same time” (65).</p>
              <p>(4) The plate sizes suggest that <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> pls. 3-2/4-5 were etched
on one side of a piece of copper and <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi> pls. 4-3/6-5 on another (69).</p>
              <p>(5) The peculiar sizes of the small color print of “Pity” (Butlin #313),<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n7" type="note">7</ref> the color print of “Albion Rose,” and of
<hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> suggest that they are cut from
<pb id="p42-8" n="8"/>
a single sheet of copper cut in four (69-70). Note that “each small plate has just one rounded corner”
(71), whereas the vendor of the large sheet would normally have rounded each of the corners of the plates.
<note id="n7">7. Tatham says that the great color prints were transferred from “millboard” or
“paste-board” (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>[2] 48fn), but Viscomi argues (72) that “the faintly embossed lines
in the horses’ hind legs, tail, and front leg, and at the head of the supine figure” indicate that
“small <hi rend="i">Pity</hi> is from a copper plate.”</note></p>
              <p>Viscomi’s use of “probably” and “therefore” sometimes leads him to state his
conclusions with a great deal more confidence than seems to me appropriate. For instance, he assumes that
copperplates were sold in standard sizes in Blake’s London, but the only persuasive evidence I have found
for such standard sizes is from Holland in 1597. The fact that “Albion Rose” is printed from copper also
used in <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi> (1795) and <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> (1795) means,
according to Viscomi, that the color prints of “Albion Rose” “could [not] have been printed in 1794”
(75). However, Blake might well have printed “Albion Rose” in the year previous to 
<hi rend="i">Ahania</hi> and <hi rend="i">Los.</hi> And Viscomi believes that “Blake was very practical in his
use of copper” (79), which is not my conclusion.</p>
              <p>Another essay dealing with the basic materials of Blake’s art is G. E. Bentley, Jr.’s
“Blake’s Heavy Metal: The History, Weight, Uses, Cost, and Makers of His Copper Plates,” 
<hi rend="i">University of Toronto Quarterly</hi> (2007), a sequel to his “[‘] What is the Price of
Experience?[’]: William Blake and the Economics of Illuminated Painting [i.e., Printing]” (1999). The
essay is even more dense with hypotheses than Viscomi’s “‘Annus Mirabilis.’” Much of the evidence
itself is hypothetical, for no copperplate from Blake’s published works in illuminated printing survives,
and the chief survivors are the copperplates for Job (1826) and Dante (1826-27).</p>
              <p>The copperplate maker punched on the back of the copperplate his name and address, making it
unusable to all but Blake, who often etched on both sides of the copper. Perhaps the most surprising
conclusions concern Blake’s biblical temperas painted on copper and his great color prints. For the biblical
temperas, we know that Blake was paid £1.1.0 each. However,
<q>
the costs for the copper on which some of them were painted were probably more than a guinea each. Not
counting the cost of his painting materials, brushes, ink, etc, the cost of the copper for most of these Bible
temperas was more than he received for them. Let us hope that the copper plates themselves were paid for by
[their purchaser] Thomas Butts. (745-46)
</q>
The copperplate for Blake’s enormous color print of “God Judging Adam” “would have weighed about 3.75
kilograms and cost new about £2.9.10” (747). He sold a copy of the print to Butts on 5 July 1805 for
£1.1.0 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>[2] 764), but the other two copies he printed were still in his possession when
he died. Blake’s use of copper seems at least occasionally to have been economically reckless.</p>
              <p>Bentley’s “Bibliomania: The Felicitous Infection and the Comforting Cure,” 
<hi rend="i">Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada</hi>, is a good deal less solemn than “Heavy
Metal,” dealing with the joys of and antidote to the collector’s mania. The Bentley collection of Blake
and his contemporaries is a modest one. Bob Essick occasionally laments that his collection of Blake,
certainly the most extensive and interesting in private hands, is not even the best Blake collection in his
neighborhood, being surpassed by that in the Huntington Library. The Bentley collection is but a small
fraction of the importance of the Bibliotheca La Solana, but it is probably the best in Canada.</p>
              <p>Tracy Chevalier’s <hi rend="i">Burning Bright</hi> and Beryl Kingston’s 
<hi rend="i">Gates of Paradise</hi> are novels set in Blake’s circle which seriously and creditably attempt to
maintain historical verisimilitude in a fictional context.</p>
              <p>In the section here on Blake’s circle, the unexpected multiplication of works on the
egregious Lady Caroline Lamb and the determinedly eccentric Thomas Taylor the Platonist throws disappointingly
little light upon William Blake, but does show disconcerting fashions in modern publishing.</p>
              <p>The addenda to <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, 2nd ed. (2004), mention Old Bailey records of
William Blakes in London in the poet’s time. However, probably none of these William Blakes is the poet or
was known to the poet.</p>

              <p>There are, it is true, two events first recorded long after Blake’s death on unknown
authority by Alexander Gilchrist (1863) and Algernon Charles Swinburne (1868) which may be the excuse for the
reference to Blake as a street brawler. According to Gilchrist, in the Gordon riots of June 1780,
<q>
Blake long remembered an involuntary participation of his own. . . . Suddenly, he encountered the advancing
wave of triumphant Blackguardism, and was forced (for from such a great surging mob there is no
disentanglement) to go along in the very front rank, and witness the storm and burning of the fortress-like
prison [Newgate] ....<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n13" type="note">13</ref>

	<pb id="p42-9" n="9"/>
Notice Gilchrist’s stress upon Blake’s passivity, his “involuntary participation” and being
“forced” to go along with the mob. This is scarcely street brawling.</p>
              <p>According to Swinburne’s unsupported testimony, once Blake saw a woman being “knocked
about” in the street and
<q>
coming up in full swing of passion fell with such counter violence of reckless and raging rebuke upon the poor
[<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] ruffian, that he recoiled and collapsed, with ineffectual cudgel; . . . such Tartarean

Notice that Blake never touched the poor ruffian. This scarcely justifies the claim that Blake “frequently

              <p>The flexibility and ingenuity of the critical imagination rarely fail to amaze me. How

creations.</p>
              <p>The annual checklist of scholarship and discoveries concerning William Blake and his circle
records publications and discoveries for the current year (say, 2007) and those for previous years which are
not recorded in <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> (1977), <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi> (1995), and
“William Blake and His Circle” (1994-2007). Installments of “William Blake and His Circle” are
continuations of <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> and <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi>, with similar
principles and conventions.</p>
              <p>I take <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi> and <hi rend="i">Blake Books Supplement</hi>, faute de

              <p>This division is organized by individual (say, William Hayley or John Flaxman), with works by
and about Blake’s friends and patrons, living individuals with whom he had significant direct and
demonstrable contact. It includes Thomas Butts and his family, Robert Hartley Cromek, George Cumberland, John
Flaxman and his family, Henry Fuseli, Thomas and William Hayley, John Linnell and his family, Samuel Palmer,
James Parker, George Richmond, Henry Crabb Robinson, Thomas Stothard, John Varley, and Thomas Griffiths
Wainewright. It does <hi rend="i">not</hi> include important contemporaries with whom Blake’s contact was
negligible or non-existent, such as John Constable and William Wordsworth and Edmund Burke. Such major figures
are dealt with more comprehensively elsewhere, and the light they throw upon Blake is very dim.</p>

              <p>The reliability of electronic “publications” is remarkably various. Some, such as 
<hi rend="i">Romanticism on the Net</hi>, with juries of peers, are as reliable as conventional scholarly
journals. Others suggest no more knowledge than how to operate a computer, such as reviews invited for the
listings of the book sale firm of Amazon.com, which are divided into those by (1) the author, (2) the
publisher, and (3) other, perhaps disinterested, remarkers. <hi rend="i">Wikipedia</hi> has over 7,000,000
articles in perhaps 130 languages with a motto “the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.” I have not
searched for electronic publications, and I report here only those I have happened upon which appear to bear
some authority. Of course many periodicals are now issued online as well as in hard copies. Electronic sites
change their names or even cease to exist, leaving not an electronic wrack behind. A Google search on 14 March
2007 for G. E. Bentley, Jr., brought up 11,400 unsorted entries, only a few of which (in the first hundred or
so) were for G. E. Bentley, the father of the searchee, or for G. E. Bentley, the metallurgist.<supplied

most of it for works in illuminated printing.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n29"

“Satan Exulting over Eve” (43.2 × 53.4 cm.) and “Elohim Creating Adam” (43.1 × 53.6 cm.), suggesting
“that one of these designs is on its recto and the other on a copper sheet acquired at the same

                    <p>According to Viscomi, Blake acquired a sheet of copper 39.4 × 54.4 cm. “This sheet
was cut exactly in half and each half was cut in half, hence each of the four quarters has a side 27.2 cm.
wide or high.” On these quarter sheets Blake etched (1) <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> (text pls. 2-5),
(2) <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi> (text pls. 3-6), (3) “Albion Rose,” and (4) the small
“Pity,”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n35" type="note">35</ref> the last always
previously assumed to be on millboard. (The prints from millboard sometimes, as in “Christ Appearing to the
Apostles” and “The Night of Enitharmon’s Joy,” exhibit striations from the millboard, despite its
sealing with glue size or gesso. The small “Pity” exhibits embossing characteristic of copper but not of
millboard.) As <hi rend="i">The Book of Ahania</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi> are both dated 1795
by Blake, the first state of “Albion Rose” is almost certainly also 1795, not 1794 as previously assumed.

“Blake in the Marketplace, 2007,” <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 41.4 (spring 2008): 142, speculates that
“Blake may have begun, c. 1818 or later, to assemble two sets of <hi rend="i">A Small Book of

inherited by his wife Catherine; at her death in 1831 they were acquired by Frederick Tatham, who wrote
“This Coloured print by W<hi rend="s">m</hi> Blake | was given to me by his Widow | Frederick Tatham |

2008): 143, suggests that the prints were printed in different colors and colored and collated (and numbered)
at several different periods. The pale-brown prints, some watermarked BUTTANSHAW,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n51" type="note">51</ref> were printed about 1802. The reddish-brown and blue prints
were printed somewhat later, perhaps at the same time (?1807) as the blue plates in <hi rend="i">America</hi>
(M) and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> proofs. Blake numbered the plates 1-28 in black ink at the top right
corners in the order of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (S) and <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> (S), which are on paper
watermarked 1808 (printing dated 1811 by Viscomi), and stabbed them in the left margin through three holes 2.6
and 3.5 cm. apart. The (hypothetical) presence in <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (R/Y) of pls. 53-54, which Blake
moved to <hi rend="i">Experience</hi> in late copies, suggests that <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (R/Y) was
collated before this transfer took place in 1818 (<hi rend="i">Songs</hi> [T<hi rend="s">2</hi>, U]). Pls.
34-36, not found in <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> (R/Y), appear in early copies of <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi>

by William Blake” (not elsewhere recorded as surviving).</p>
                  <p>The company is descended from John Dixon, who printed proofs of Blake’s 
<hi rend="i">Job</hi> on 3-4 March 1825 (<hi rend="i">BR</hi>[2] 410, 783, 804), and from Dixon &amp; Ross, who

&lt;http://www.thomasross.co.uk&gt;, lists over 5,000 subjects for sale, including Flaxman, Hogarth, Linnell,
and Stothard (apparently from the original of his Canterbury Pilgrims plate), but the only Blake there is a
reduced facsimile of his Canterbury Pilgrims plate.</p>

                  <p>A very original and rewarding essay. “Blake’s idea of the ‘fibres of love’
derives partly from a spiritual strand embedded in [Enlightenment] fibre medicine . . . and partly from a
spiritualized trend of Swedenborg’s idea of a divine organ.” “Blake, in appropriating and enlightening
the fibre’s three representative functions of weaving, mediating, and spiritualizing, and in grounding his
visionary work with images of the fibre and the fibre-woven body, was working through a set of intellectual
and metaphorical cruxes that originated in fibre medicine. He therefore may be called the last progeny, not
the radical opponent, of Enlightenment fibre medicine” (87, 88).</p>

                <p>The Norfolk Record Office in Norwich has recently received a major archive of letters to
the Reverend William Gunn (1750-1841) of Irstead, near Norwich. He was an antiquarian, author of, inter alia,
<hi rend="i">Inquiry into the Origin and Influence of Gothic Architecture</hi> (1819), about which Flaxman
corresponded with him.</p>
                <p>The archive includes rich letters of 1794 to 1827 from John Flaxman (in Rome in 1794, in
Buckingham Street, Fitzroy Square, thereafter) and from Flaxman’s wife Nancy, his half-sister Mary Ann, and
his sister-in-law Maria Denman, often writing as his amanuenses or about him. Frequently the letters are
thanks (belated) for turkeys, pheasants, and barrels of herring, but often they are rich in details of
Flaxman’s work as a sculptor and about the art world, elections to the Royal Academy, commissions to other
sculptors, and exhibitions of art. Some of Flaxman’s letters include sketches, especially of arches and of
Anglo-Saxon architecture.</p>
                <p>There appears to be no reference to William Blake the poet in the archive, but there is a
mysterious Mrs. Blake and a prosaic William Blake. The letters cited here are from John Flaxman unless
otherwise noted.</p>

of 29 May 1803 says “The Cottager is returned &amp; speaks with due gratitude of Kindness shewn to her in
London.” Gentlemen, who lived in houses, weren’t often on social terms with cottagers—the Blakes are an
exception. Nancy Flaxman sent “love to the good Cottagers” on 10 Dec. 1802, and John Carr asked on 29 Jan.
1803 to be remembered to the “owner of the little white-faced Cottage on the sea shore” (i.e., Blake).
However, there is no evidence, and little likelihood, that Catherine Blake was in London in May 1803.</note>

Staffordshire:
<q>
I flatter myself it may please you to find in this paper a slight little sketch of the monument erected at
Dereham to the beloved object of our poetical idolatry [William Cowper]. The design (if 
<hi rend="u">design</hi> is not too grand a name for a slight &amp; simple composition) is my own which my
excellent friend Flaxman condescended to execute in Marble at the desire of Lady Hesketh.

Perhaps Blake had copied the design, as he had those sent with Hayley’s letters of 21, 25 Feb., 7, 13, and
24 March 1802.

the Yale Center for British Art, is in an extra-illustrated copy of the second edition of J. T. Smith’s 
<hi rend="i">Nollekens and His Times</hi> (1829). The leaves are loose, and the extra-illustrations are numbered
to indicate with which printed page they are associated—the Twopenny letter is number 474 (referring to the
Blake biography in Smith’s book). Some of the extra-|illustrations are annotated and signed by the great
autograph collector William Upcott (e.g., nos. 58, 66), suggesting that the collection belonged to him.

told Linnell in an undated letter (see <hi rend="i">BR</hi>[2] 490), had been “taken to pieces for

Upcott, 15-19 June 1846, lot 910 (“2 vol. <hi rend="i">unbound</hi>,” extra-illustrated “to 4 vol.”).

Britain</hi> (London: William Smith, 1828) in the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> for 3 January 1829 went out of its

<q>
Closely associated with the desire of knowing the exclusive history of such [famous] personages, is the wish

and verify or correct the images which fancy has formed by the true copy which the art that confers
immortality has preserved of them. The late Mr. Blake, the engraver, whose genius was subject to a kind of
morbid excitement, was so possessed with this notion, that he had contracted a belief that he could, almost at
will, bring before his actual physical eyesight the forms of the great men of this and other countries, whose
existence he could only know by means of history. Under this delusion, which, however, was of no kin to
madness, and could not have happened to any but a person of exalted imagination, he had frequent interviews
with his distinguished buried acquaintance, and used to relate his imaginary conversations with them in
perfect conviction of their truth and reality.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n75"
