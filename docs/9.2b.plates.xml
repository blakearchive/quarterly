          <p>This pamphlet includes all of Blake’s pictures of the Last Judgment that are accessible
            in public collections. It does not include the earliest preparatory sketch for the
            Rosenwald drawing (the so-called “Tatham-Robertson drawing,” listed as no. 643 in Martin
            Butlin’s forthcoming catalogue <corr type="emend">raisonné)</corr> which was sold to a private
British collector
            in 1949. It does not include two other drawings which have been untraced since the
            nineteenth century, the first (Butlin 640) is probably a preliminary drawing for the
            Pollok House version which was purchased by Flaxman in 1806 (see Bentley, 
            <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi>, 575). The second is a tracing (Butlin 647) which may be identical
            with the tracing of the Rosenwald drawing reproduced in this pamphlet (no. 6,
            Tatham-Bateson drawing, Butlin 646). The most important item missing is, of course, the
            five by seven foot tempera with gold, the climactic version of the Last Judgment which
            dropped from sight shortly after Blake’s death in 1827.</p>
          <p>The pictures are arranged in chronological order, although it should be noted that the
            year in which the Schiavonetti engraving was published (1808) is not necessarily the
            year Blake made the drawing for it, and the date of the Rosenwald drawing is disputed
            (Keynes places it in 1810, A. S. Roe argues for 1820-25). Four distinct treatments of
            the theme are exhibited here: (1) the Pollok House watercolor; (2) the Petworth House
            watercolor; (3) the Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> engraving; (4) the Rosenwald
            drawing, together with a preliminary sketch (the Texas drawing) and the tracing
            mentioned above. It is generally assumed that the lost tempera was based upon the
            Rosenwald drawing, although the discrepancies between Blake’s drawing and his notebook
            description (<hi rend="i">A Vision of the Last Judgment</hi>) suggest that the
            composition was further modified in the final tempera.</p>
