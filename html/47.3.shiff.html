<p>Blake portrays the Orthodox Jewish ritual for the priestly blessing in plate 17 of <em>Illustrations of the Book of Job</em>. This essay explains the ritual, analyzes Blake’s iconography, and argues why he resorts to this Jewish practice.
</p><p class="strong">1. Zeitgeist</p>
<p>A history describing religion and culture in the England of 1815 observes that the period was <span class="notecall">“remarkable for its intense [Christian] religious life.”</span><span class="fn">Halévy 1: 387.</span> The study of Hebrew and Greek was encouraged to promote the reading of the Old and New Testaments in their original languages. <span class="notecall">A man of his time, Blake studied Hebrew and incorporated it into his art.</span><span class="fn">See Shiff.</span></p>
<p>Not appreciated today—and crucial to my argument—is that the 
Protestant theologians also encouraged the study of Jewish religious 
rituals to understand how the ancient Israelites implemented biblical 
commandments. In the introduction to a book explaining Judaism to 
Christians, the Methodist theologian and scholar Adam Clarke (c. 
1762–1832) urged:
<span class="extract"><span class="notecall">I have now reason to hope 
that every serious Christian, of whatever denomination, will find this 
Volume a faithful and pleasant guide to a thorough understanding of all 
the customs and manners, civil and religious, of that <em>people</em> to
 whom God originally entrusted the Sacred Oracles. Without a proper 
knowledge of these it is impossible to see the reasonableness and 
excellency of that worship, and of those ceremonies, which God Himself 
originally established among the Israelites ….</span><span class="fn">Clarke vi. The “Volume” that Clarke refers to is a French book on the Jewish religion (based on Johannes Buxtorf’s <em>Juden Schul</em>)
 by Abbé Claude Fleury (1640–1723, a member of the French Academy), 
first translated into English in 1750. Clarke brought out three 
subsequent editions, with the fourth edition of 1820 enhanced and 
expanded.</span></span>
From Cromwell’s era there was a continuous immigration of religiously observant Jews to England. <span class="notecall">Succeeding
 generations separated from the Orthodox Jewish tradition into which 
they were born and educated, and assimilated into the predominant 
society—some converting to Christianity, the ultimate assimilation.</span><span class="fn">In
 1943 Abraham Cohen, an English rabbi and scholar, posed the question, 
what did Englishmen know about Jews and Judaism two or three centuries 
ago? From systematically assembled extracts from diaries, letters, and 
books of travel up to the Victorian era, he demonstrates the interest in
 Hebrew and Jewish practice and the study of Jewish religious literature
 by the clergy in Oxford and Cambridge, even before Cromwell’s time, and
 the constant curiosity about Jewish practice wherever Englishmen 
encountered Jews in foreign lands. He also gives examples of English 
Jews assimilating and converting: “The majority of the Jewish families 
which had settled in England under Cromwell, and prospered, disappeared 
from the [Jewish] community within a century …” (Cohen, <em>An Anglo-Jewish Scrapbook</em> 221).</span> In cosmopolitan London, <span class="notecall">Blake
 had ready access to knowledge about Jewish religious rituals from 
assimilated or converted Jews and from fellow Protestants who studied 
Judaism to understand the roots of Christianity and to proselytize.</span><span class="fn">See
 Ruderman and also Spector, especially her “Introduction: The Politics 
of Religion,” 1-13, and Schuchard’s “William Blake and the Jewish 
Swedenborgians.”</span></p>
<p class="strong">2. Ritual</p>
<p>To make the iconography of the priestly blessing in plate 17 understandable, I begin by explaining the ritual. <span class="notecall">The priestly duty to bless the children of Israel is a biblical command.</span><span class="fn">Numbers
 6.22-27: “22. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying: 23. ‘Speak unto 
Aaron and unto his sons, saying: On this wise ye shall bless the 
children of Israel; ye shall say unto them: 24. The Lord bless thee, and
 keep thee; 25. The Lord make His face to shine upon thee, and be 
gracious unto thee; 26. The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and 
give thee peace. 27. So shall they put My name upon the children of 
Israel, and I will bless them’” (Cohen, <em>The Soncino Chumash</em> 825-26).</span> In this ritual, the blessing is from God through the agency of priests. The Hebrew word for priest is <em>kohen</em> (<span lang="he">כהן</span>‎). Aaron, the brother of Moses, <span class="notecall">was the first Jewish <em>kohen</em>,</span><span class="fn">In
 the Orthodox tradition, a Jewish male attains the title of rabbi after 
completing theological studies. A priest may study to become a rabbi. In
 contrast, the title of priest is a birthright, automatically conferred 
upon a male whose father is a priest. A rabbi who is not of patrilineal 
descent from Aaron may not perform the priestly blessing or any other 
role a priest has in the religious life of an Orthodox Jewish community.
 A rabbi who happens to be a priest is obligated to observe the priestly
 duties.</span> and <span class="notecall">the blessing mandated of him 
and his male descendants is a tradition that continues uninterrupted to 
this day by men who are priests by patrilineal descent.</span><span class="fn">Patrilineal
 genealogy is embedded in the convention for naming children. Names in 
Hebrew for ritual purposes follow the biblical formulation. First is the
 individual’s given name﻿(s)﻿, then the relationship to the father, 
followed by the father’s given name﻿(s)﻿, e.g., B the son of A, or C the
 daughter of A. The honorific title <em>Ha-Kohen</em> (the priest) is 
appended to the father’s name if he is a descendant of Aaron. The father
 of Moses and Aaron was Amram, who was not a priest. Amram’s two sons 
were Moses son of Amram and Aaron son of Amram. After Aaron was 
appointed priest, his son was Eleazar son of Aaron the Priest. In turn, 
Eleazar’s son was Phinehas son of Eleazar the Priest. This convention 
maintains the tradition of priestly patrilineal genealogy.</span> In the Orthodox Jewish tradition, <span class="notecall">the rite is performed only during certain prayer services to a congregation convened in a quorum.</span><span class="fn">In
 the Orthodox tradition, the minimum requirement for a quorum is ten 
males who are thirteen or greater. The blessing is given if the quorum 
contains one priest at least of age thirteen.</span> At the appropriate point in the service, <span class="notecall">the priests gather in a group before the assembly and in unison chant words unchanged from biblical times.</span><span class="fn">Among
 the oldest biblical writings uncovered in Israel by archaeologists are 
amulets with the priestly blessing. For details, see Barkay et al., “The
 Challenges of Ketef Hinnom” and “The Amulets from Ketef Hinnom.”</span> During the blessing, <span class="notecall">priests cover their heads and outstretched arms and hands with the <em>talis</em> (prayer shawl).</span><a name="12" id="12"></a><span class="fn">The Hebrew word for prayer shawl is four letters (<span lang="he">טלית</span>‎)
 pronounced in two syllables. In Israel, where the Sephardic dialect 
predominates, it is pronounced “tah-lit,” while in the Ashkenazic 
dialect, whose origin is in eastern Europe and which was spoken by Jews 
in Blake’s London (and in which the author is educated), the 
pronunciation is “tah-lis.” Today the transliteration is usually spelled
 with a single “l” as <em>talis</em> or <em>talit</em>. The <em>Encyclopaedia Judaica</em> uses <em>tallit</em>:<br> <span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px">Tallit,
 prayer shawl. Originally the word meant “gown” or “cloak.” This was a 
rectangular mantle that looked like a blanket and was worn by men in 
ancient times. At the four corners … tassels were attached in 
fulfillment of the biblical commandment … (Num. 15:38-41). … After the 
exile of the Jews [after the Romans destroyed the Second Temple] … and 
their dispersion, they came to adopt the fashions of their gentile 
neighbors …. The <em>tallit</em> was discarded as a daily habit and it became a religious garment for prayer; hence its later meaning of prayer shawl.</span>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; text-indent: 15px">The <em>tallit</em> is usually white and made either of wool, cotton, or silk …. Strictly observant Jews prefer [the <em>tallit</em> to be] made of coarse half-bleached lamb’s wool.</span></span>
 The congregation stands and faces the priests, but does not gaze 
directly at their hands. The Bible does not detail the technical 
methodology for performing the blessing. Maimonides (1135–1204), in the <em>Mishneh Torah</em>, his code of Jewish practice, describes the procedure:
<span class="extract"><span class="notecall">When the leader of the 
congregation [leader of the prayers] reaches the blessing … all the 
priests in the synagogue leave their places, proceed forward, and ascend
 the <em>duchan</em> [the platform at the front of the synagogue on which is the <em>heichel</em> (ark containing the torah scrolls)]. They stand there, facing the <em>heichel</em>,
 with their backs to the congregation …. [Then] they turn their faces to
 the people [turn around to face the congregation], spread out their 
fingers, lift up their hands shoulder high, and begin reciting ….</span><span class="fn">Maimonides 2: 190-92. Maimonides wrote the <em>Mishneh Torah </em>in
 classical Hebrew. He is known as the RAMBAM (pronounced in both Hebrew 
and English as two syllables, “Rahm-Bahm”), which is the pronunciation 
of the four-letter acronym (RMBM: <span lang="he">רמבם</span>‎) of his 
Hebrew name: Rabbi Moses ben [son of] Maimon. “Maimonides” is the 
Latinized version of “the son of Maimon.” His works translated into 
Latin were available to Christian theologians who were not Hebraists. 
After Maimonides there were other codes of Jewish law by rabbis of 
different communities and traditions, none of which needs to be entered 
into for the purposes of this paper.</span></span>
The practice for extending arms, hands, and fingers has several variations, <span class="notecall">with each priest using the tradition taught to him by his father.</span><a name="14" id="14"></a><span class="fn">Gold
 explains that “there are more than a dozen customs on how the Kohanim 
[priests] hold their hands. All are equally valid …,” but illustrates 
only two (41). Rubenstein shows five positions (23-26). Six are in Katz 
(72-75), who advises that his “set of illustrations lists some of the 
hand and finger positions in use today.” In Berg’s unpublished thesis 
three hand positions are described, but not illustrated (74-75). Because
 of duplication, these works portray only six of the multiple 
traditional variations.</span> The hands of the priests never touch the persons being blessed—there is no <span class="notecall">laying on of hands.</span><span class="fn">Ritual
 handwashing is required before priests may give the blessing. Touching 
any person before completing the blessing renders a priest ritually 
impure and unfit to make the benediction, and rewashing is required. 
Priests are a clan of the tribe of Levy. In the days of the Temple, the 
priests officiated, performing the sacrifices and blessings. The 
patrilineal male descendants of Levy who were not of the priestly clan 
provided support services, including the purifying ablutions of the 
priests, and they are identified by the title Levite. The children of 
Levites are named B the son of A, the Levite, or C the daughter of A, 
the Levite. Today, in the Orthodox tradition, the obligation of washing 
the hands of priests preparatory to the benediction continues for male 
Levites.</span></p>
<p>A representation of one of the more common finger configurations is often engraved on the tombstones of priests. <span class="notecall">Raised hands show fingers extended (see illus. 2).</span><span class="fn">Hands held for blessing is the traditional gravestone emblem for the priest; for the Levite it is a water pitcher.</span>

Because the monument’s surface is vertical, the observer perceives the 
hands as held in an absolute upright position, which is not the actual 
practice. In the synagogue, the priests hold their arms shoulder high, 
fully extended, (near) parallel and horizontal. The hands are fully open
 with fingers extended. The palms face down toward the ground. However, 
because the priests stand on a platform at some level (if only one step)
 above the congregation, the effect is for the palms to be presented 
obliquely toward the assembly.
<p>As shown by the tombstone, the symmetrically arranged hands are in 
contact at two points: thumb-tip to thumb-tip and index-finger tip to 
index-finger tip. Of the fingers on each hand, some touch along their 
full lengths, while others are separated: the thumb is apart from the 
index finger; the index and middle fingers touch; the middle finger is 
apart from the ring finger; and the ring and little fingers touch. The 
religious significance is not in the touching, but in the gaps 
established by the symmetrical separations. <span class="notecall">The gaps represent the lattice fence in the Song of Songs,</span><span class="fn">Song
 of Songs 2.9: “9. … Behold, he standeth behind our wall, He looketh in 
through the windows, He peereth through the lattice” (Cohen, <em>The Five Megilloth</em>).</span>

outstretched arms, interposed between God and God’s agent—the priest—and
 the people receiving the blessing.</p>

 details of the ritual, its history in Orthodox Jewish practice, and the
 prayer services during which the priestly blessing is given, see Gold. 
After the Enlightenment, Jews in England (and elsewhere) separated from 
the Orthodox tradition and adopted reformed religious practices, 
including changes to the ritual of the priestly blessing. The Orthodox 
practice is pertinent to this paper because the English Reform liturgy 
is essentially post-Blake.</span><br><br>

God blesses Job in plate 17. Every one of the five characteristics of the priestly blessing is present.</p>
<p>Before I analyze the iconography, two points should be remembered. 
First, how easily the ritual is described, especially when accompanied 
by a demonstration of the hand position (see <a href="#illus3">illus. 3</a>).
 This is all the information Blake would have needed to compose the 
blessing scene in plate 17. Second, and more importantly, the technique 
is not described in the Bible. Blake could not have known of it from 
self-study of the plain text (the words in the Bible without exegetical 
commentary).</p>
<p class="strong">3. Iconography</p>
<p>Plate 17 (<a href="#illus1">illus. 1</a>) depicts two sentences from the last chapter in Job. <span class="notecall">The plain text of Job 42.5 tells of Job’s gazing upon God.</span><span class="fn">Blake
 engraved Job 42.5 beneath the image: “I have heard thee with the 
hearing of the Ear but now my Eye seeth thee.” The tableau shows Job 
kneeling before Blake’s typical depiction of God—a figure with a pensive
 expression and flowing hair and beard who radiates glory.</span> Seven sentences further on <span class="notecall">God blesses Job (42.12).</span><span class="fn">Job
 42.12 is engraved beneath the image on plate 21: “So the Lord blessed 
the latter end of Job more than the beginning.” Job, restored to 
prosperity, is surrounded by his new family—the consequence of God’s 
blessing.</span> Blake conflates the two into a single composition to show God in the act of blessing. The five characteristics are present.<br><br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 25px">A: Both arms are extended in parallel.<br>
B: Both arms are held horizontal.</span><br><br>
The first two are obvious in plate 17 and require no analysis.<br><br>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 25px">C:&nbsp;Fingers of both hands are held in a symmetrical pattern to create gaps.</span><br><br>
What Blake engraved requires close examination by magnification. The 
configuration of the left hand is obvious, even when not enlarged. 
Perceivable only when magnified are the telltale details of the right 
hand. First, see illus. 3 for a diagrammatic comparison: the image from 
the tombstone is illus. 3a, while illus. 3b is what Blake portrays in 
plate 17.

The enlargement makes evident the finger positions of the right hand and
 the gaps created thereby: a mirror image of the left hand.
<p>In contrast, the hands in the watercolors for Thomas Butts and John 
Linnell are not symmetrical (illus. 5-6). Absent in both drawings is the
 symmetry of finger gaps, because Blake drew the right hand to be seen 
on edge, and did not carefully detail that hand’s gaps (though the red 
arrow in illus. 6 indicates one gap). Whatever his reason for not 
showing the gaps in the drawings, Blake included this crucial feature in
 the engraving.

<p>Two differences between plate 17 and the tombstone require comment. 
The first is that Blake shows the hands separated from one another. This
 is not a concern, as hands symmetrically positioned but not in contact 
is a traditional variation. <span class="notecall">The second difference is that Blake’s version of the finger gaps is not one of the six portrayed in the references I cited.</span><span class="fn">See <a href="#14">note 14</a>.
 Two of the five positions in Rubenstein and two of the six in Katz show
 hands apart. In all instances, the configurations of hands and fingers 
are symmetrical.</span> The simplest assumption to explain Blake’s 
configuration of finger gaps is that he never personally observed the 
priestly blessing given in a synagogue, and that his source taught him 
the positions shown in <a href="#illus3">illus. 3b</a>. Perhaps it is a 
variant tradition alluded to but not illustrated in the references, or 
it may be Blake’s understanding of a description he read somewhere.</p>
<p>Information about the ritual was readily available in books. A 1656 translation of Buxtorf’s <em>Juden Schul</em> gives this description:
<span class="extract">The Priest, putting on his Talles, <span class="notecall">which is a course hair cloth,</span><span class="fn">For an explanation of a “talles” (<em>talis</em>) made from “course hair cloth,” see <a href="#12">note 12</a>.</span>
 which was folded about his neck over his head, so as it may hide his 
eyes, blesses the people with the usuall benediction as was commanded <em>Numb. 6</em>.
 Which while he pronounces, the people put their hands before their 
faces, not daring to look upon his hands, because the spirit of God 
rests on them during the benediction, as ’tis written <em>Cant. 2.9</em>. <em>Behold he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the window, shewing himself through the lattesse</em>. <span class="notecall">that is, God standeth behind the Priest, and looketh through the distances of his fingers.</span><span class="fn">Ross
 366. This translation is attributed to the clergyman and scholar 
Alexander Ross (1591–1654). Buxtorf (1564–1629) was the preeminent 
Protestant Hebraist of his generation, professor of Hebrew at Basel 
University, author and publisher of Hebrew lexicons and rabbinic 
literature, and the official censor of Hebrew publishing at Basel. He 
had extensive contact with Jews at the Frankfurt book fairs and with the
 Jewish proofreaders at the Basel press, and corresponded in Hebrew with
 Jewish booksellers throughout Europe. For a biography of Buxtorf and 
his son of the same name, an eminent Hebraist in his own right, and an 
introduction to Protestant Christian Hebraist scholarship, see Burnett. 
Buxtorf’s <em>Juden Schul</em> was published in nineteen editions, 
translated into Dutch, French, Latin, and English, and became the 
sourcebook for Christian theologians about Jewish religious practice.</span></span>
Additional detail is in another translation, from 1663:
<span class="extract">Then the Priest wrapping a great hair-cloth about 
his neck, and drawing it over his head, so far untill it come to the 
threshold of his eyes: he blesseth the people according to the ordinary 
forme prescribed by <em>Moses</em>, Numbers the 6, the 24, 25, 26, and 
27 verses. When he pronounceth the blessing, he stretcheth out his hands
 towards the people: they covering their faces with their own; for it is
 lawful for no man to look upon the hands of the Priests: because the 
spirit of the Lord rests upon them, while he blesseth the Congregation. <span class="notecall">As it is written, <em>He standeth behinde our wall looking forth at the windows, shewing himself through the grates</em>,
 that is to say, God stands at the Priests back, and looks through the 
windows and grates, that is to say, through his hands being stretched 
out, and his fingers being spread abroad severed one from another.</span><span class="fn">A. B. 235.</span></span>
Versions of Buxtorf were published three times in London <span class="notecall">between 1734 and 1748.</span><span class="fn">Johann Andreas Eisenmenger’s <em>Entdecktes Judentum</em>
 was Englished by John Peter Stehelin and published in London in three 
known editions with Buxtorf as an accompanying volume: 1734 (copy in the
 New York Public Library); 1743 (<em>Eighteenth Century Collections Online</em> [<em>ECCO</em>] Part II); and 1748 (<em>ECCO</em>).
 For Buxtorf’s description of the priestly blessing, see 2: 340. The 
title page of the 1734 edition, vol. 1, states that the accompanying 
work is “Abridg’d from the <em>Latin</em> of Buxtorff.”</span> However, none of the descriptions gives detailed information about how the hands and fingers are configured.</p>
<p>Perhaps Blake adopted what he believed to be a Christian religious equivalent. <span class="notecall">He favored Albrecht Dürer,</span><span class="fn">“Blake
 was a print-seller for a time, and he had an extensive print collection
 of his own, started in his boyhood and sold in 1821, when his poverty 
was most severe. Nothing is known about what Blake sold or collected 
except that his taste ran to Dürer and to sixteenth-century Italian 
engravers, out of fashion at the time” (Johnson 154).</span> whose <em>Apocalypse</em> woodcuts have examples of the hand position of <a href="#illus3">illus. 3b</a> (see illus. 7 and 8). If not from Dürer, then of course the model may have been from some other work. <span class="notecall">An exhaustive review of possible sources is beyond the scope of this paper.</span><span class="fn">Warner
 does not describe the hand and finger positions in plate 17, and she 
makes no comment about Blake’s portraying the Jewish ritual of the 
priestly blessing. She does suggest the possible influence on Blake by 
John Bulwer. In 1644, Bulwer published a work describing the conventions
 of hand and arm configurations used to embellish vocal orations, with 
five charts of woodcuts depicting a subset of the many conventions 
discussed. Warner reproduces three of the charts on pp. 50, 51, and 56 
of her work. The chart on p. 50 has twenty-four images, of which image 
Z, “Benedictione dimittit,” is Bulwer’s representation of the priestly 
blessing. In the section of his text entitled <em>Chironomia</em>, Bulwer explains image Z in five pages (59-63): “<em>Canon</em> XLIX. Both <em>Hands</em> modestly extended and erected unto the shoulder points, is a proper forme of <em>publicke benediction</em>, for the <em>Hands</em>
 of an Ecclesiasticall Oratour when hee would dismisse his Auditours.” 
He then expounds on the significance of the gesture, drawing on the 
Bible, Jewish tradition (as he understands it), Buxtorf’s <em>Juden Schul</em>,
 Roman Catholic tradition, and the gestures used by Protestant preachers
 that he personally observed. Although Bulwer describes the significance
 of the finger positions, his visual representation (image Z) fails to 
conform to the Jewish ritual, as the arms are vertical and the four 
fingers of each hand are not symmetrically separated. The other 
two-handed configurations in the chart that superficially resemble what 
Blake engraved in plate 17 are described by Bulwer as other than 
benedictions or the offering of blessings. Bulwer was not Blake’s 
authority for plate 17. <span style="display: block; text-indent: 15px">Cleary’s
 1974 edition of Bulwer begins with a scholarly introduction, modernizes
 Bulwer’s English, and translates his Latin quotations. In the notes, 
Cleary identifies and lists as fully as possible the source documents 
that are cryptic in Bulwer’s marginal notes and the sources for the 
Latin quotations, and he also defines obscure terms. He does not, 
however, comment on the images in the charts.</span> <span style="display: block; text-indent: 15px">Bulwer
 (1644) and Cleary’s edition of Bulwer (1974) could not have been of any
 assistance to Warner in recognizing what Blake did in plate 17.</span></span>

<p class="subtitle">Immanentistic Emblem</p>
<p>Had Blake depicted in plate 17 the finger gaps portrayed in <a href="#illus3">illus. 3a</a>, this alone would make it certain that he emulates the Jewish priestly blessing. Had he depicted the configuration of <a href="#illus3">illus. 3b</a>
 in plate 17 and nowhere else, then it would unambiguously be associated
 with God’s delivering a blessing. Nowhere, however, do I observe his 
using the positions of illus. 3a. Instead, he uses those of illus. 3b in
 many compositions, most of which do not obviously show God in the act 
of blessing. Four such examples are in <a href="#illus9">illus. 9-12</a>. <span class="notecall">A
 survey of Butlin finds forty-two images with one or more instances of 
the positions of illus. 3b in a wide variety of settings and themes.</span><span class="fn">Butlin

 (c. 1810), has the fingers of both hands configured as in illus. 3b, 
but without any of the other characteristics of the Jewish priestly 
blessing.</span></p>
<p>Joseph H. Wicksteed provides a solution in describing Blake as an <span class="notecall">“immanentalist.”</span><span class="fn">“But for an immanentalist like Blake …” (Wicksteed 27).</span> I suggest that Blake <span class="notecall">(who was steeped in the emblem tradition, as Mary Lynn Johnson explains)</span><span class="fn">See Johnson.</span>
 adopted the finger positions of illus. 3b as an emblem. Francis Quarles
 (1592–1644) defines the religious meaning of emblems in his <em>Emblemes</em>, which pairs parables expressed in words with their equivalents in woodcut images:
<span class="extract">TO THE READER. An Embleme is but a silent Parable.
 Let not the tender Eye checke, to see the allusion to our blessed 
Saviour figured, in these Types. In holy Scripture, He is sometimes 
called a Sower; sometimes, a Fisher; sometimes, a Physitian: And why not
 presented so, as well to the eye, as to the eare? Before the knowledge 
of letters, God was knowne by <em>Hierogliphicks</em>; <span class="notecall">And, indeed, what are the Heavens, the Earth, nay every Creature, but <em>Hierogliphicks</em> and <em>Emblemes</em> of His Glory?</span><span class="fn">Quarles sig. A3.</span></span>
The hand with fingers configured as in illus. 3b is an immanentistic 
emblem that represents God’s ever-present blessing (see illus. 9-12). It
 is for this purpose, I suggest, that Blake used it in many 
compositions, including plate 17 where it is certain that God is 
blessing Job.</p>

In contrast, Blake engraves plate 10 with the fingers splayed in 
different directions. Extended fingers not held symmetrically to form 
the metaphorical lattice fence cannot be a configuration for a blessing,
 and in this plate the gesture is an accusatory condemnation. <span class="notecall">Blake used the same expression of censorious judgment in a sketch for <em>Tiriel Denouncing His Sons and Daughters</em> (c. 1789).</span><span class="fn">Butlin pl. 224.</span> Jeanne Moskal also recognizes the gesture in other works: <span class="notecall">“This motif [﻿in plate 10﻿] recalls other Blakean portrayals of accusation ….”</span><span class="fn">Moskal 23.</span><br>

does Blake bring together arms, hands, and fingers properly configured

In plate 17, <span class="notecall">God’s palms face toward Job—there is no laying on of hands.</span><span class="fn">Blake
 depicts God’s hands above Job’s head. There is a custom (not a 
biblically ordained commandment) for parents to bless children at home 
on Friday evenings at the start of the Jewish Sabbath by the laying on 
of hands. The father places his hands on the head of the oldest child 
and invokes a blessing (not necessarily using the words of the priestly 
blessing), then repeats the process with each child in age order. In 
some families the mother does the same. This is not the priestly 
blessing, which is restricted to priests in a congregation convened in a
 quorum for prayer, and does not utilize the laying on of hands.</span> 
The composition places God and Job in close proximity, so Blake could 
easily have put the hands of God on Job’s head, had he chosen to do so. 
See illus. 17 for an example of Blake’s depicting the laying on of 
hands. In contrast, the blessing in plate 17 is from a distance.

Throughout the <em>Job</em> plates, <span class="notecall">whenever Blake portrays God and humans in the same tableau, the humans do not look at God’s radiating glory.</span><span class="fn">Plate
 2 is composed of two separate tableaus, God in heaven and humans on 
earth. The humans are not in the presence of God’s glory. We see the 
same in plate 5. Plate 9 depicts a dream discussed by one of Job’s 
friends—God is not present, as he is recalled in the dream, which is 
shown in a “balloon” of clouds. In plate 13 Blake has Job’s wife and 
friends present when God appears (the friends hide their faces, but 
Job’s wife does not). The compositional separation is the whirlwind. 
Plate 14 shows two tableaus, humans beneath heaven, and God above. Two 
tableaus are depicted in plates 15 and 16 also.  In plate 17 Job’s 
friends avert their faces (though one attempts to peek), but his wife 
does not. Plate 18 has the smoke from the burnt offering on the altar 
ascending without turbulence; this is proof of acceptance by God. The 
human figures kneel with eyes averted, except for Job, who looks upward 
toward the glorious radiance that Blake associates with God. Job does 
not look upon God, because God is not portrayed in the tableau. Finally,
 in plate 20, God is depicted on a decorative panel behind Job, with the
 humans in the panel bowed and not looking at God. God is not in the 
foreground with Job, and the daughters have no need to hide their faces.</span>
 In the biblical plain text, God blesses Job, with no mention of the 
presence of Job’s wife or friends. With artistic liberty, Blake includes
 them in plate 17. Job’s friends avert their eyes (though one attempts 
to peek). This is consistent with the practice that a congregation does 
not look at the priest’s hands during the ritual—the hands form the 
representation of the lattice fence, with God’s presence on the far 
side. Job also does not look directly upon God (see illus. 18).

<span class="notecall">Andrew Wright offers an interpretation for what he perceives as Job’s incongruous behavior.</span><a name="37" id="37"></a><span class="fn">“Before
 Job can be accepted [by God] he must be trained to see. The theme is 
insistent here, for the numerous texts which appear in the borders have 
as their common feature the injunction to look, and the principal 
motto—it appears in the lower border—is, ‘I have heard of thee by the 
hearing of the ear, but now my eye seeth thee’. And yet Job is not 
looking at God, who stands directly above him and his wife; he stares 
away, into the middle distance. The vision which he has been taught, and
 which now at last he has learned, is inward …” (Wright 43).</span> I 
suggest that it is nothing other than Blake’s representing the 
traditional synagogue practice of averting one’s gaze so as not to look 
at the priest’s hands during the blessing.
<p>A comparison of the Butts and Linnell drawings confirms that Blake 
intended the plate to represent the synagogue ritual. Job avoids gazing 
at God in the Butts image (<a href="#illus5">illus. 5</a>), but looks directly at him in the Linnell (<a href="#illus6">illus. 6</a>). Why this difference? The Linnell is in conformance with the biblical plain text of Job 42.5 (see <a href="#illus1">illus. 1</a>):
 “I have heard thee with the hearing of the Ear but now my Eye seeth 
thee.” The Butts conforms to the synagogue ritual of avoiding gaze. 
Blake evaluates the two compositions. The quandary is that he cannot 
have it both ways and must choose one over the other for the engraving. <span class="notecall">He chooses to engrave the synagogue ritual.</span><span class="fn">I
 offer no comments on the other differences: (1) In the Butts, God is 
erect, whereas he is stooped in the Linnell—the Linnell version is 
chosen for the engraving; (2) The three friends kneel forward toward God
 in the Butts, and away from him in the Linnell—again Blake chooses the 
Linnell version. Not pertinent to this analysis are the pencil sketch 
for the design and the New Zealand set (see <em>Illustrations of the Book of Job by William Blake</em> fascicles IV and V and, for the sketch, the <em>William Blake Archive</em> [Drawings and Paintings, Pencil Sketches, Sketchbook Containing Drawings for the Engraved Illustrations to the Book of Job, <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=but557.1.penc.23&amp;java=no" target="_blank">object 23</a>]).</span></p>
<p><span class="notecall">Avoiding gaze is a subtle feature in the watercolor <em>God Blessing the Seventh Day</em> (c. 1803–05) (illus. 19).</span><span class="fn">Keynes dates the painting to “about 1803” (<em>William Blake’s Illustrations to the Bible</em> xii); Butlin (1: 336) suggests c. 1805.</span>

An observer sees a frontal view of God in the act of blessing. The 
recipient of the blessing, the seventh day, is not in the composition. 
At first impression, Blake apparently places the viewer, who is outside 
the composition, in the position of the seventh day, as if God blesses 
the observer.
<p>This is Blake’s typical depiction of God—pensive expression, flowing 
hair and beard, radiating glory. Four of the ritual’s characteristics 
are obvious. Palms are toward the observer. The hands are symmetrically 
held at shoulder height, with fingers arranged as in <a href="#illus3">illus. 3b</a>.
 The arms are parallel, but not extended horizontally. I explain the 
arms folded at the elbows by assuming artistic liberty—Blake is avoiding
 the foreshortening effect that would occur if the arms were horizontal 
and fully outstretched, jutting forward at shoulder height into the 
observer’s space.</p>
<p>The last characteristic, averting gaze, is present but deliberately 
not made obvious. W. Graham Robertson, an owner of this painting and an 
artist himself, offers this criticism: <span class="notecall">“The colour throughout is fine, and the design impressive, but the central Figure [God] cannot be considered successful.”</span><span class="fn">Robertson 119. The editor quotes Robertson’s and Rossetti’s descriptions of <em>God Blessing the Seventh Day</em>.
 Rossetti described it as “very characteristic and fine”; Robertson, 
however, criticized Blake’s portrayal of God. Did Blake really err? The 
difficulty, I suggest, is not with Blake’s execution, but with 
Robertson’s comprehension. Because he lived in a later zeitgeist, 
Robertson more than likely lacked Blake’s knowledge of Jewish religious 
practice and was unable to recognize the subtle but critical feature of 
averted gaze in a painting whose theme is God in the act of blessing. 
The challenge of living in a different zeitgeist also applies to Wright 
(see <a href="#37">note 37</a>), who did perceive the averted gaze in plate 17 but could not decipher Blake’s intention.</span>
 He does not explain what he finds disturbing—I surmise it is the 
direction of God’s gaze. God should be looking directly at the seventh 
day he is blessing, as in plate 17 where he looks directly at Job. If 
the observer is standing in the position supposedly occupied by the 
seventh day, there should be eye-to-eye contact when the observer looks 
at God’s face. Instead, God appears focused elsewhere. Here Blake 
introduces the synagogue practice that those who are receiving the 
blessing do not look directly upon God, who is beyond the metaphorical 
lattice fence formed by the priest’s fingers. Blake has God focused on 
the seventh day, not on the observer. The painting is a depiction of God
 blessing the seventh day, just as the title indicates. It is the 
seventh day that should avert gaze, not the observer. Thus, there is no 
eye-to-eye contact.</p>
<p>Finally, observe the six angelic figures flanking God, with all wings
 (but two) folded and in which God nestles, as if seated on a throne of 
angel feathers. Each angel holds aloft one hand, palm side out, the 
fingers of which are in the position of <a href="#illus3">illus. 3b</a>, echoing the blessing theme. (Why six angels? Possibly the six days that precede the seventh day.)</p>
<p>In both <em>God Blessing the Seventh Day</em> and plate 17, Blake 
depicts the characteristics of the Orthodox Jewish synagogue ritual for 
the priestly blessing. The feature he chooses to make subtly obscure 
differs, however. In <em>God Blessing the Seventh Day</em> it is an 
averted gaze; in plate 17 the hidden feature is the finger gaps of the 
right hand. Blake deliberately introduces subtleties. Another example is
 in the watercolor <em>Job’s Evil Dreams</em> (Butts set), where three 
Hebrew words intended to represent a portion of the Ten Commandments are
 not a commandment at all, but a hidden message. <span class="notecall">“Blake
 precisely depicts the plain text of the Bible …. He then adds imagery 
not in the Bible …. Blake deliberately made the slogan appear to be a 
commandment—a visual illusion.”</span><span class="fn">Shiff pars. 19-20.</span> A future essay will argue why Blake does this.</p>
<p>Unanswered is which came first, Blake’s knowledge of the priestly blessing whence he developed the emblematic symbol (<a href="#illus3">illus. 3b</a>),
 or his adoption of an existing Christian convention, later to be 
incorporated into the compositions where God blesses in plate 17 and <em>God Blessing the Seventh Day</em>. The dating is instructive. <em>God Blessing the Seventh Day</em> is c. 1803–05. “Look What a Fine Morning It Is” (<a href="#illus10">illus. 10</a>), <span class="notecall">clearly not the depiction of a priestly blessing and just the use of an immanentistic emblem,</span><span class="fn">Arms
 are not parallel. Palms are not facing down. The figure is not a Jewish
 priest. The setting is not a synagogue with a quorum in attendance. The
 full title indicates that the hand gesture is Blake’s emblematic 
representation for God’s ever-present blessing: “Look what a fine 
morning it is._Insects, Birds, &amp; Animals, are all enjoying 
existence.”<br> <span style="display:inline-block; text-indent: 15px">Not
 surveyed for this paper is the earliest occurrence in Blake’s work of 
the gesture as a stand-alone emblematic symbol, or its use by other 
artists.</span></span> is 1791. By the end of his stay in Felpham 
(1800–03) or soon after, Blake knew and used all of the features 
characteristic of the Jewish priestly blessing.</p>
<p class="strong">4. Verisimilitude</p>
<p>Blake painted biblical scenes for his patron Butts, including <em>Zacharias and the Angel</em> (illus. 20).
</p><div class="illus"><img src="850.jpg" height="418" width="600"><div>20. Blake, <em>Zacharias and the Angel</em> (c. 1799–1800). Metropolitan Museum of Art, Bequest of William Church Osborn, 1951 (51.30.1).<br><span style="display: inline-block; text-indent: 15px">Image

The painting depicts the New Testament story (Luke) where an angel 
appears before Zacharias while he is performing priestly duties inside 
the Temple. <span class="notecall">Blake’s creative challenge is to draw
 upon his artistic imagination to represent convincingly the Temple 
scene by portraying the high priest’s garb and the various implements 
used in the sacred rites, while faithfully adhering to the Old 
Testament’s description of the costume and objects.</span><span class="fn">Baetjer
 (“[Item] 88. The Angel Appearing to Zacharias,” 178-80) quotes the 
entry from the 1906 Carfax Gallery catalogue: “Blake represents in 
minute detail the furniture and vestments ordained by the Law.” The 
“Law” refers to the Old Testament.</span>
<p>Verisimilitude, then, is the critical concept in understanding the iconography of the Bible series and <em>Illustrations of the Book of Job</em>.
 However, because there is no description in the Bible as to how God 
goes about giving a blessing, or the technique by which the priests are 
to perform the rite, Blake must rely on the synagogue practice of the 
Jews for a model.</p>
<p>The verisimilitude argument raises a problem that may not be ignored.
 In plate 17 God’s hands hover above either side of Job’s head. Clearly,
 the blessing is for Job alone, and this depiction is consistent with 
the Bible’s plain text. Contrary to the biblical story is the presence 
of Job’s wife, who is beside him as if also receiving the blessing, and 
who gazes directly at God. Why Blake gives her a prominence that is the 
antithesis of verisimilitude remains to be explored in a future essay.</p>
<p class="strong">Conclusion</p>
<p>Blake was a religious personality in a Christian zeitgeist that 
promoted and encouraged the study of the Israelite implementation of 
God’s revealed Law. In cosmopolitan London knowledge about Judaism was 
readily available. It should not be surprising that Blake relied upon 
the Orthodox Jewish synagogue ritual of the priestly blessing as his 
model for depicting how God blesses Job.</p>
