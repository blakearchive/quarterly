                <p>The idea of having a Blake Newsletter seems to have sprung like Leutha from the head of
Satan; I don’t know who can claim paternity. The need seemed suddenly obvious. Much help was given in the
early stages by David Erdman, who called a meeting of Blake scholars at the last MLA convention and who also
sent out a preliminary announcement. Gerald E. Bentley, Jr. contributed valuable suggestions and prodding.
<corr type="emend">Fred Whitehead</corr> sent a list of ongoing Blake projects. There were encouraging letters
and contributions from Blake scholars in seven different countries. This modest first issue is the result, and
it is now up to you whether the project deserves to be continued.</p>
                <p>As far as editorial policy is concerned, I think the Newsletter should be just that — not
an incipient journal. (Enough are born, even too many, without these arts). It will include announcements,
queries, controversy, and notes of special interest to Blake scholars — all of an informal nature (a “family
wall-newspaper,” as David Erdman puts it). Regarding work-in-progress, my own inclination is to report on
ongoing editorial and bibliographical projects, but not on critical or scholarly studies before they are
completed. In that way, I hope to avoid the suggestion of “reserving” subjects. However, I’d like to have
readers’ views on this, as well as on other subjects.</p>
                <p>I’ll undertake to publish issues of the Newsletter on October 15, January 15, and April
15. The subscription price will be two dollars, which will cover the first four issues, including this one.
New readers will receive back issues as part of their subscription — any other arrangement would involve
book-keeping complications that I’m not able to undertake.</p>
                <p>The second issue of the Newsletter will be dedicated to S. Foster Damon. Former students
and associates of Professor Damon are especially invited to contribute.</p>
