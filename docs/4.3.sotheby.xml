                    <p>The word “First” appears in the title, Preludium, and in the colophon; the lines “The
web is a female in embrio . . . ” (plate 25) and “All the seven deadly sins of the soul” (plate 4) are not
erased.</p>
                    <p>Bound in after the title-page is another impression of plate 2 (Preludium), with the
words “Preludium to the first book of” painted out, and with a painted border surrounding the figures added by
Blake, who has also delicately heightened the figures with pen and brush; this plate is on different paper and
is inlaid to size.</p>
