        <p>The 1987 Blake market came in like a lamb and went out like a tyger. The spring auctions
          and dealers’ catalogues offered no Blake drawings, no important separate plates, and only
          a single posthumous impression from one of Blake’s illuminated books (see illus. 1). In
          contrast, November and December brought forth the rediscovery and sale of 
            <hi rend="i">America</hi> copy R and a previously unrecorded copy of that curious broadside, 
            <hi rend="i">Little Tom the Sailor.</hi> The fall of 1988 promises an equal display of
          treasures, for Christie’s New York will place on the auction block three Blake rarities
          from the Edward L. Doheny Memorial Library: <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> copy N,
          Blake’s letter to John Linnell of 2 July 1826, and a water color Blake painted for Thomas
          Butts c. 1805, <hi rend="i">The Infant Jesus Saying His Prayers</hi> (Butlin #473).</p>
        <p>The market’s response to artists associated with Blake showed exceptional strength for
          most high quality items, but a weaker performance in the middle and lower ranges. What are
          very probably modern auction records were set for a print by James Barry (£935—see illus.
          6), a sketch by J. H. Mortimer (<hi rend="i">Salvator Rosa</hi>, £4620), an erotic sketch
          by Fuseli (<hi rend="i">Callipyga</hi>, sold in November 1986 for £24,200), a painting by
          Linnell (<hi rend="i">Harvest Dinner</hi> and <hi rend="i">Noonday Rest</hi>, each at
          £46,200), and a post-Shoreham water color by Palmer (<hi rend="i">The Brothers in</hi>
          Comus <hi rend="i">Lingering Under the Vine</hi>, £63,800). Yet, within the same auction
          season, several oil sketches by Linnell failed to find buyers and Palmer’s lovely water
          color of c. 1851, <hi rend="i">Sheep in the Shade</hi>, failed to exceed its reserve
          (i.e., the price below which an auction lot will not be sold).</p>
        <p>Books with Blake’s commercial illustrations continued to appear with reasonable
          regularity. Complete copies of the Job engravings are increasingly rare and dear, as
          demonstrated by the eye-popping auction record established by a published “proof” set on
          laid India at Christie’s on the first of December, £30,800. The market also provided at
          least one scrutable prophecy: the only two copies of Blake’s <hi rend="i">Night
            Thoughts</hi> offered at auction were purchased by Japanese dealers.</p>
        <p>The year of all sales and catalogues in the following lists is 1987 unless noted
          otherwise. The auction houses listed in the <hi rend="i">Abbreviations</hi> add their
          purchaser’s surcharge to the hammer price in their price lists. These net amounts are
          given here, following the official price lists. Several late 1987 auctions, for which
          price lists are not yet available, will appear in the 1988 review. Copy designations and
          plate numbers for the illuminated books follow G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake
            Books</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977). “Butlin#—” refers by entry number to Martin
          Butlin, <hi rend="i">The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</hi> (New Haven &amp;
          London: Yale Univ. Press, 1981), 2 vols.</p>
        <p>I am grateful for help in compiling this list to Shelley Bennett, G. E. Bentley, Jr.,
          Detlef Dörrbecker, Edwin Epps, Richard Godfrey of Sotheby’s, Alexander Gourlay, Robert
          Halsband, William Plomer of Agnew’s, Justin Schiller, David Weinglass, and especially
          Thomas Lange.</p>

            <head>1. Blake.</head>
            <figDesc><hi rend="i">America</hi>, pl. 7. Relief etching, posthumous impression in pale
              brick red ink, 24 × 17 cm. Photo courtesy of Sotheby’s, London. It is unusual to find
              a posthumous pull of any relief etching with the borders wiped, but circumstantial
              evidence suggests that this impression was pulled by Frederick Tatham after Blake’s
              death. The sheet is signed on the verso by J. Deffett Francis and dated 1834. Thus,
              the print can be associated with impressions of <hi rend="i">America</hi> pls. 2, 5,
              and 15, given by Francis in 1878 to the Glynn Vivian Gallery, Swansea. These three
              impressions are also printed in “reddish-Brown” (according to Bentley, 
                <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 89) and have wiped borders (according to information kindly
              supplied by G. E. Bentley, Jr.). Pl. 5 in this group has a Whatman 1831 watermark.
              Thus, it seems likely that all four impressions are posthumous.</figDesc>

            Burmester speculates interestingly on the possibility that the first pl., showing a
            statue of a “River God,” was engraved by Blake, as S. B. Hamilton claims in the 
              <hi rend="i">Architectural Review</hi>, vol. 116, no. 695, on the basis of unstated
            evidence. Like hundreds of other unsigned pls. of the period, this one, etched in a free
            style similar to pls. by and after J. H. Mortimer, may be by Blake, but there is simply
            no evidence for such an attribution.</p>
