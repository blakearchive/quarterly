 intrigued by its design and visionary promise only to close it in 
bafflement, or you are an expert Blake scholar, you owe it to yourself 
to read this book. Yoder begins by identifying a dominant trend in 
studies of the poem since Paley’s monumental <em>The Continuing City</em>: he argues that the majority of the poem’s explicators have come to the conclusion that <em>Jerusalem </em>has
 no overarching narrative structure. In his book, he demonstrates 
precisely how the poem’s narrative has been neglected or trivialized and
 what the crucial consequences of taking the narrative into account 
would be.</td>

      <td class="paranumber">2</td>
      <td class="body">The book has four main chapters. In his 
introduction and in the first chapter, Yoder reviews the evidence for 
the non-narrative or “synchrony” argument and traces the history of that
 scholarship. A large section of this chapter attends closely to De 
Luca’s characterization of the poem as a “wall of words” that provokes 
the reader to experience the sublime. Yoder provides abundant 
counterevidence to De Luca’s assertions. For example, De Luca bases his 
notion of the “wall of words” on the “notorious” (De Luca’s term) plate 
16,
<blockquote>crammed as it is with sixty-nine lines of verse that run 
virtually from one edge of the copperplate to the other …. The text 
presents itself, in short, as a solid wall of words over which the eye 
slips, unable to find fastening. A second glance discriminates bristling
 ranks of capital letters, verse without syntax, nouns without 
predication, names without context. (De Luca, “A Wall of Words” 232, 
qtd. in Yoder 39)</blockquote>
Yoder points out, however, that this plate forms the conclusion to the 
five plates describing the building of Golgonooza, beginning with 12.25,
 and that the action of the plate is the “uniting of biblical and 
British geography by means of the labors of Los and his workers” (41). 
Granting that lines like “Levi. Middlesex Kent Surrey. Judah Somerset 
Glouster Wiltshire. / Dan. Cornwal Devon Dorset, Napthali, Warwick 
Leicester Worcester” (16.45-46) may look as though they are 
asyntactical, Yoder reminds us that the two preceding lines provide the 
context and the missing syntactical elements: “And the Forty Counties of
 England are thus divided in the Gates / Of Reuben Norfolk, Suffolk, 
Essex. Simeon Lincoln, York Lancashire”. (This Blakean tactic of 
providing the syntax and context of difficult lines elsewhere in the 
poem should be familiar to any reader of “London,” which gives the 
second-person command “HEAR” in the initial letters of the first word of
 each line in the third stanza to complete its syntax.) He analyzes all 
of the plates that might count as “walls of words,” thirty in all, to 
argue against De Luca and then focuses on the first, plate 10, which 
looks even denser than plate 16, to show that the meanings of individual
 words—which De Luca believes to be of little importance—have 
extraordinary significance: this is the plate in which appears one of 
Blake’s most famous lines, Los’s statement that “I must Create a System,
 or be enslav’d by another Mans” (10.20). As Yoder says, “if the poem is
 read as de Luca suggests, it is small wonder that it appears to have no
 narrative” (45).</td>

      <td class="paranumber">3</td>
      <td class="body">As he makes his case for a narrative approach, 
Yoder fully acknowledges the impediments to discerning the narrative, 
but then goes on to show that those impediments are deliberate and 
functional. The conclusion of the first chapter makes the useful point 
that all texts force readers to become active to some degree. Yoder 
takes his cue from Richard Lanham and Julia Wright to articulate the 
ways in which Blake’s unusually opaque style demands that readers 
oscillate between looking <em>at</em> the style and looking <em>through</em>
 the style. Yoder thinks that De Luca is so captivated by the style that
 he cannot see through it to the narrative it traces. By contrast, we 
should read both with our “Intellectual Powers” and our “Corporeal 
Understanding.”</td>

    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">4</td>
      <td class="body">The second chapter begins the work of tracing the
 narrative itself. Criticizing De Luca’s claim that the poem’s sequences
 have “no necessary order,” Yoder also argues against the prevailing 
opinion that the characters in the poem are simply mouthpieces for ideas
 rather than players in a drama or story (De Luca, <em>Words of Eternity</em>
 138, qtd. in Yoder 55). The static structure posited by the adherents 
of synchrony leads to this mischaracterization. By analyzing scene 
sequences in terms of the characters who interact within them, he 
identifies four “basic threads” of narrative associated with a main 
actor: Albion, Los, the narrator, and characters from the “anterior 
myth” (Paley’s phrase) presented in <em>The Four Zoas</em> (57). For Yoder, the most important story concerns Albion, Jerusalem, Albion’s Spectre, and Vala. Although the poem begins <em>in medias res</em>,
 it tells the story of Albion’s choice between competing discourses of 
divinity and the consequences of his decisions, including his fall, his 
paranoia, and the divisions among his children. In his narrative, Los 
reacts to Albion’s actions as well as to his own Spectre and Emanation 
in order to consolidate error and to keep the Divine Vision by building 
Golgonooza and the Mundane Shell. The narrator’s story of attempting to 
write the poem parallels Los’s story: like Los, he feels alone and 
helpless as he labors to grasp and represent the consequences of 
Albion’s disease manifested in the narrator’s (and the reader’s) world 
and time. The fourth thread tells the obscure “anterior myth” of 
Tharmas’s murder, Luvah’s trial, and Albion’s seduction by Vala. 
Pointing out that the Saviour has access to all four threads, providing 
their point of unification into a single story, Yoder begins the work of
 interpreting the poem’s portrayal of the relationship between the human
 and the divine.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">5</td>
      <td class="body">In this chapter, Yoder does scholars a genuine 
service by detailing the scenes that belong to each thread and by 
telling the stories as they unfold within each of the poem’s four 
chapters, explaining conflicts, errors, deceptions, and resolutions. 
Part of his discussion is a tour de force demonstration of the narrative
 order of the sequence of two four-plate blocks within plates 28-50, 
chapter 2, rearranged by Blake in two copies. His discussion is both 
revelatory for its impact on how we should understand Blake’s purposes 
and a discrete warrant for his claims about the narrative structure of 
the poem. The difference that the new contexts of the rearranged plates 
make for the narrative requires an extensively detailed discussion, too 
complex for recapitulation here. Suffice it to say that I am persuaded 
through this explication that Yoder has truly understood the purport of 
the poem’s form. He asks: “Why the trouble with Chapter 2? In Chapter 2 
Albion’s fall is not yet irrevocable. … Chapter 2 is about the 
possibility of saving Albion from himself. … The role of Chapter 2 in 
the narrative of <em>Jerusalem</em> is to hold open the moment of 
Albion’s fall, in the possibility that it might be understood and 
prevented” (94-95). Agreeing with both Paley and De Luca that chapter 2 
is the key to the poem, Yoder stakes his argument for the critical 
function of narrative, in a counter to these scholars, on this 
successful and fascinating demonstration.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">6</td>
      <td class="body">The third chapter articulates some of the 
difficulties that readers encounter when trying to follow the poem’s 
narrative threads. Referring to these difficulties as a function of 
Blake’s “rhetoric of discontinuity,” Yoder regards Blake’s delay of 
speech attribution, his use of characters who “divide and reunite,” his 
spatial reorientation, and the problems of knowing when a scene opens or
 closes as the key strategies for disrupting our expectations about 
narrative structure. But identifying characters, attributing speech, 
distinguishing the parameters of a dialogic space, and recognizing 
scenic shifts are fundamental readerly functions. Why, then, does Blake 
obscure them at some times and not at others? Yoder closely reads a 
large number of plates both to demonstrate the presence of an 
oscillation between clarity and obscurity of the narrative and to 
indicate how Blake is seeking actively to transform his reader to learn 
what Albion must learn about the unity of mankind and individuality of 
minute particulars.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">7</td>
      <td class="body">Yoder does far more than simply repeat in other 
words what Blake and his many explicators have said about the variation 
in “Perceptive Organs” and their “Objects of Perception” or about the 
expansion and contraction of the senses. He actually demonstrates how 
this happens in specific and abundant detail. I cannot do justice to his
 exposition, but perhaps an extended example will indicate the 
usefulness of his method:
<blockquote>In the first part of Chapter 3, the scene changes are often 
punctuated with plate shifts, while in the second part of the chapter 
such correspondences are repeatedly undermined. … I divided <em>Jerusalem</em>’s
 Chapter 3 into eight scenes; of the seven transition points between 
scenes, the first four occur at plate shifts (55.1, 56.1, 60.1, 63.1). 
However, the end of the scene that begins at 63.1 violates that pattern 
in a way that emphasizes the change. The scene is a long depiction of 
the blood orgy, and it ends with a vision of the aggregate male, Hand, 
and the aggregate female, Rahab, whose “Brain enlabyrinths the whole 
heaven of her bosom &amp; loins” (70.29). At the bottom of plate 70, 
separated from the verse paragraph immediately above is the single line,
 “The Starry Heavens all were fled from the mighty limbs of Albion” 
(70.32). This line, marking the end of the plate, makes a fitting end to
 the violence of the blood orgy and the eerie calm of the closing vision
 of the aggregate male and female. But when plate 71 opens, “And above 
Albions Land was seen the Heavenly Canaan” (71.1), that closing line 
must be reread as the opening line of the spatial reorientation that 
introduces the “exploration of states.” This use of the single opening 
line to straddle the change of plates is mirrored later when the final 
line of the exploration scene appears as the first line of text on plate
 73. The very minuteness of the violation of the expected pattern—the 
use of a single line to create a tension between the expected reading 
and the necessary rereading—emphasizes the danger of passive reading …. 
Instead, lines of continuity overlay points of demarcation, creating a 
narrative characterized by bright spots of drama that expand and 
contract according to the reader’s perceptions. (122-23)</blockquote>
This level of detail is a hallmark of Yoder’s discussion, and even 
though this is a short book, it has ample close readings, each of which 
not only makes Yoder’s larger point about the narrative structure of the
 poem but also adds to the reader’s appreciation of the poem’s artistry 
and philosophy. In this chapter, Yoder is concerned to help the reader 
understand why narrative is critical to Blake’s purposes, for without 
the impulse to follow the narrative (an impulse blocked by the 
synchronic approach), the reader will not have a reason to engage in the
 recalibrations of identity, spatiality, and organization that form the 
very intellectual exercise the poem is designed to foster. Narrative is 
necessary to change the reader’s mind.</td>

      <td class="body">The final chapter takes up the more daunting 
challenge of articulating the poem’s staging of “the conflict between 
the competing claims of divine authority that drive the plot of <em>Jerusalem</em>”
 (125). Arguing against some scholars (my younger self included) who 
despair of finding a textual basis for choosing between the Saviour’s 
and the Spectre’s claims to divinity—because the claims mirror each 
other and because both are predicated on rhetorical constructions of 
authority—Yoder advances the plausible notion that Blake does give the 
reader grounds for making a decision, even in the face of such 
uncertainty: “The basis for deciding between the divine discourse of the
 Saviour and that of the Spectre lies in the difference between their 
responses to the problem of sin, and in <em>Jerusalem</em> the Saviour 
offers a system of forgiveness so radical that it shocks even Los and 
the poem’s narrator” (126). This chapter is a virtuoso synthesis of 
Blake’s corpus and its attendant scholarship as well as a sensitive 
reading of the poem to support that claim. It should be read for its 
clear explanation of the core of <em>Jerusalem</em> and its compelling demonstration of the reasons why Blake shaped his poem the way that he did.</td>

      <td class="body">The book has some weaknesses: for experienced 
Blake scholars, the long reprise of the “synchronic” school may be 
tedious and even argumentative, even though Yoder is at pains to 
delineate critical differences (which may make it particularly useful 
for students). The third chapter could benefit from more examples of 
extended readings. In citing parts of the text that exemplify one or 
another point, he doesn’t offer expanded interpretations. But these are 
minor complaints in the context of the very important work that this 
book represents. After my first reading, I wished that Yoder had gone on
 to write a comprehensive explication of the poem in sequence and in 
detail, as Donald Ault has done for <em>The</em> <em>Four Zoas </em>in <em>Narrative Unbound</em>.
 But on a second reading, I was well satisfied that Yoder’s explanation 
of the poem’s unique enterprise, special techniques, and inspiring 
philosophy offers an indispensable introduction to <em>Jerusalem</em>.</td>
