Innocence and Experience”</hi> (sic), The

          <p>It is hard for me to believe that this could be an idea whose time has come.
                        In two taped lectures of about forty-five minutes each, a British schoolmarm
                        with a good BBC Third Programme accent leads us on a docent tour of the 
<hi rend="i">Songs Of Innocence and Of Experience.</hi> Along the way she
                        offers us a little history, a little biography, some judicious glosses from
                        other works by Blake, and a glimpse of the Major Themes: Energy,
                        Imagination, Contraries, Apocalypse, Revolution, Rationality,
                        Priestcraft—all described clearly, succinctly and soberly. The tape
                        is, in effect, a kind of low-tech <hi rend="i">Cliff Notes.</hi></p>
          <p>This is not to say that it is without merit. As an introduction, one can
                        hardly fault it. Professor Bottrall is an epitome of Anglo-American critical
                        common-sense, and she covers an impressive amount of territory. She sees
                        Blake’s work in his career and his career in his century. She deals
                        fairly effectively with relationships between text and illustrations. She
                        knows about textual alterations in copies of the <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi>
                        She is skeptical of reading Blake as a doctrinal mystic. She keeps it
                        simple, but not at the expense of irony and enigma. And she only
                        occasionally lapses into sententiousness, as when she claims that
                        “Blake restores to us our lost innocence. . . . Art can make good that
                        loss, but life cannot”; or when she gently dismisses the later work
                        because Blake’s “schemes are too arbitrary, his nomenclature too
                        individualistic, ever to commend his reading of superhuman nature to the
                        generality of men.” One wishes, at such moments, that she were on hand,
                        so that one could ask a pointed question about generality, or remind her
                        that Blake was not interested in that which could be made explicit to an
                        idiot.</p>
          <p>The problem is not really with Professor Bottrall’s interpretations,
                        which are good enough for an introduction. Indeed, the perspectives she maps
                        out are probably much the same as those with which many of Blake’s
                        most sophisticated readers began. The problem is rather one of medium, of
                        appropriate form, of pedagogical viability. How are students to listen to
                        this? With their hands folded on their desks? Certainly, slides of the
                        relevant plates could be shown with the lecture, but would that be enough?
                        The tape is designed to be heard by high school and beginning college
                        students, but it is really <hi rend="i">for teachers</hi> who have to teach
                        Blake but feel they know little or nothing about him. Professor Bottrall
                        serves <hi rend="i">them</hi>, as a guest lecturer or substitute
                        teacher.</p>
          <p>If teachers believe they need this tape, they should listen to it at home and
                        work out some positions on the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> for themselves. But
                        no student should be forced to endure it. Professor Bottrall wants to
                        interest students in Blake, but to do that you need to involve them in an
                        active encounter with the texts, to interrogate them and be prepared for
                        their questions. You should not just point out and explain details, but show
                        a slide and get the students to discover for themselves significant
                        pictorial and textual details. You should not tell them that the language of
                        the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> is simple and musical, but get them to recite
                        the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> until they experience at least something of
                        their simplicity and music. You should not tell them that the nomenclature
                        of the later work is complex and formidable, but encourage them to explore,
                        say, “Tirzah,” in a kind of paranomastic free association until at
                        least some of the name’s allusions are clearly experienced. I find it
                        hard to believe that, in a tape-and-slide show of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>,
students would be likely to profit from or retain much of
                        Professor Bottrall’s short course; it would, I suspect, be the fiery
                        images of the plates themselves into which the students would be drawn. And
                        it is that attraction which should be encouraged and developed.</p>
