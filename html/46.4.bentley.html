<p class="title">Blake and Stedman as Costumiers: Curious Copies of Blake’s Engravings in 1821</p>
<p class="byline">By G. E. Bentley, Jr.</p>
<p class="note"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">G. E. Bentley, Jr.</span> (<a href="mailto:gbentley@chass.utoronto.ca">gbentley@chass.utoronto.ca</a>) has been publishing about William Blake and his circle since 1954. His <em>William Blake in the Desolate Market</em> (McGill-Queen’s University Press) is in the final stages of proof.</p>
</div>
<div id="text">
<p class="first">the <span class="firstsidenote">With thanks to Robert Brandeis, scholar, librarian, and friend.</span>Costume <span class="notecall">is correct according to authentic monuments</span><span class="sidenote">Blake, <em>Descriptive Catalogue</em> (1809), ¶18, and “Blake’s Chaucer: An Original Engraving” (1810), ¶9 (<em>William Blake’s Writings</em>, ed. G. E. Bentley, Jr. [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978] 2: 834, 866).</span></p>
<p>Blake’s quarto engravings of sensational scenes for his friend John Gabriel Stedman’s <em>Narrative, of a Five Years’ Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam</em>,
 2 vols. (1796), were perhaps more widely seen by his contemporaries 
than any others he made.&nbsp; Not only did the first edition sell very 
well—I have traced 138 copies in public collections—but it was reprinted
 in the less common edition of 1806 (26 copies) and the rather uncommon 
edition of 1813 (11 copies).</p>
<p>Though the designer is Stedman, an interesting amateur artist, it 
seems likely that some aspects of the engravings are due to the 
engravers.&nbsp; As Robert Essick comments,
</p><blockquote>Stedman’s amateur drawing is not without charm, but his 
figures lack grace, and his sense of composition (although perhaps 
faithful to the scene portrayed) falls below contemporary standards of 
proportion and balance.&nbsp; <span class="notecall">Thus it seems fair 
to believe that the dignified postures and expressiveness of the 
features in Blake’s plates were in part the work of the engraver.</span><span class="sidenote">Robert N. Essick, <em>William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations</em> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991) 71. A Stedman drawing not engraved for the <em>Narrative</em> is in Gordon N. Ray, <em>The Illustrator and the Book in England from 1790 to 1914</em> (New York: Pierpont Morgan Library; London: Oxford University Press, 1976) 9.</span></blockquote>
In his 1785 diary, Stedman remarked that <span class="notecall">“my 
talents for drawing were so universally admired that my parents were 
advised … to Encourage me since I would make a figure by proper 
cultivation not inferiour even to Rubens or van Dyk.”</span><span class="sidenote">John Gabriel Stedman, <em>Narrative …</em>, ed. Richard Price and Sally Price (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988) xliii.</span> An example of the changes made by engravers to his drawings is his sketch of the <em>Manner of Sleeping &amp;c. in the Forest</em>, showing heavy jungle and a fire built under the hammock to keep off mosquitoes; <span class="notecall">Barlow’s engraving of it in 1791 for the first edition shows open savannah and the fire clearly to one side.</span><span class="sidenote">Stedman, <em>Narrative …</em>, ed. Price and Price, xliii, xlvi, fig. 7.</span>
<p>Further, Stedman’s <em>Narrative</em> was repeatedly reprinted abroad, <span class="notecall">often with prints,</span><span class="sidenote">According to Bentley, <em>Blake Books</em>
 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977) 624, the Stedman copperplates were 
apparently not reused in editions of Halle (1797), Paris (1799), Leiden 
(1799), Lausanne (1799), Amsterdam (1800), Stockholm (1800), London 
(?1809), Milan (1818), and Boston (1838).</span> as<br>

<p>Blake’s plates for Stedman were also adapted in some surprising contexts.

</p><blockquote><span style="display: block; margin: 0px auto; text-align: center;"><em>ALMOST SURREALISTIC SCENE</em></span>
77 (SLAVERY AND ABOLITION.) [BLAKE, WILLIAM].&nbsp; <strong>The Skinning of the Aboma Snake shot by Cap. Stedman.</strong>&nbsp;
 Untitled hand-tinted version of one of William Blake’s engravings for 
John Gabriel Stedman’s “Narrative of a Five Year’s Expedition against 
the Revolted Negroes of Surinam.”&nbsp; 7 x 9 3/8 inches; small embossed
 stamp of Bramati, “costume antico e moderno.” [Milan, 1818]<br>
<strong>Estimate $400-600</strong><br>
<em>Probably from the Italian edition of Stedman’s “Narrative.”&nbsp; 
This version of Blake’s engraving has added to it a smiling black 
gentleman who appears to be standing in a poppy field.&nbsp; According 
to Stedman, the snake was 22 feet long.</em></blockquote>
Nothing like this plate has been recorded in connection with Blake 
before, and there are a number of very puzzling features of the design 
reproduced (<a href="#1">illus. 1</a>) and of the description of it.

<p>In the first place, the surrealistic scene combines two engravings by
 Blake after Stedman’s designs: “The Skinning of the Aboma Snake, Shot 
by Cap. Stedman” (<a href="#2">illus. 2</a>) and “The Celebrated Graman Quacy” (<a href="#2">illus. 3</a>) in Stedman’s <em>Narrative</em> (1796), vol. 1, at p. 174 (18.3 x 13.7 cm.), and vol. 2, at p. 348 (18.5 x 13.4 cm.); <span class="notecall">the dimensions of the design (17.8 x 24.5 cm.)</span><span class="sidenote">The
 dimensions of the print given in the Swann catalogue (7 x 9 3/8″=17.8 x
 24.5 cm.) are for the image only; the platemark is 19.7 x 26.0 cm. (in 
the Toronto set).</span> are slightly smaller than the combination of the designs of these two prints would give (18.5 x 27.1 cm.).

Further, the layout has been altered from portrait (vertical) to 
landscape (horizontal), with a number, 59, above the top right corner of
 the framing line.&nbsp; To be bound in a conventional volume, higher 
than it is wide, the print would have to be turned sideways.
<p>In the second place, the print comes not “from the Italian edition of
 Stedman’s ‘Narrative’” of Milan, 1818, with small octavo plates, but 
from an entirely separate work in folio, as Brandeis brilliantly 
discovered. <span class="notecall">The crucial clue is “Bramati,”</span><span class="sidenote">There were three Bramati brothers, all engravers: Giuseppe (1795-1871), Antonio (1799-1875), and Luigi (1801-60) (<a href="http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/bramati_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/" target="_blank"><em>Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani</em></a>, vol. 13 [1971]). Giuseppe is the engraver of the Ferrario plates.</span>
 whose name appears below the right corner of the design and in the 
embossing.&nbsp; The surrealistic scene comes from an enormous and 
enormously complicated&nbsp;compilation in seventeen folio volumes by 
Giulio Ferrario, which was published simultaneously in Italian and 
French editions, sometimes mixed together, such as the sets in the 
British Library and&nbsp;the Fisher Rare Book Library of the University 
of Toronto.&nbsp; The French version is called<br>
<em>Le costume ancien et moderne ou histoire du gouvernement, de la 
milice, de la religion, des arts, sciences et usages de tous les peuples
 anciens et modernes, d’après les monumens de l’antiquité et accompagné 
de dessins analogues au sujet par le docteur Jules Ferrario</em> (Milan: De l'imprimerie de l'éditeur, 1817-26).<br>
The Italian version is entitled<br>
<em>Il costume antico e moderno, o, storia del governo, della milizia, 
della religione, delle arti, scienze ed usanze di tutti i popoli antichi
 e moderni provata coi monumenti dell’antichità e rappresentata cogli 
analoghi disegni dal dottor Giulio Ferrario.</em></p>
<p>It was originally issued in 143 weekly installments, with over 1500 
folio prints sold both plain and colored.&nbsp; There were later 
editions in Florence (26 8º vols., 1823-28), Naples (20 vols., 17 cm., 
1831-42), Livorno (100 12º vols., 1830), and Turin (26 vols., 22 cm., 
1834). Sometimes sets were sold, or at least survive, with only a single
 continent or even a single country.&nbsp; The portions devoted to the 
Americas are in vol. 7 (1820), with 87 prints (called America vol. 1), 
and vol. 8 (1821), with 80 prints (called America vol. 2, and on the 
half-title page <em>Costumes de tous les peuples de l’Amérique seconde partie Amérique méridionale</em>).</p>
<p>Elaborate efforts were made by Ferrario to ensure authenticity.&nbsp;
 The half-titles are stamped with the signature of “Giulio Ferrario,” 
and each print is embossed with a very small circle labeled Bramati, 
“costume antico e moderno,” presumably to frustrate forgers and 
imitators in the absence of international copyright.&nbsp; After all, 
Bramati was borrowing Stedman’s images without notice.&nbsp; When 
Laurence Sterne wanted to guarantee the authenticity of the authorized 
editions of <em>Tristram Shandy</em>, he signed each copy himself.&nbsp;
 This was much more time-consuming than stamping and embossing, and it 
could not be delegated to a mechanic—but on the other hand, Sterne was 
signing only one leaf per volume, whereas the Bramati embossing appears 
eighty times in the second volume of Ferrario’s America.</p>
<p>The engraving and coloring of the Bramati prints are professionally 
skillful.&nbsp; Most of the scenes are landscape dimensions and printed 
sideways. <span class="notecall">There are at least four plates derived from Blake’s plates in Stedman.</span><span class="sidenote">The
 model for the Ferrario prints cannot be “the Italian edition [1818] of 
Stedman’s ‘Narrative,’” as the Swann catalogue suggests, for the 
Ferrario prints copy Stedman pls. 7-8, 19, 32, 35, 49, 53, 68, 71, and 
76, and of these only pls. 7, 19, 35, 49, 68, and 76 appear in the Milan
 1818 edition; pls. 8, 32, 53, and 71 echoed in Ferrario are not in the 
Milan edition.</span>&nbsp; Indeed, most of the information in the 
section of Ferrario’s text “de la Guyanne” seems to be derived from 
Stedman, “traduction Italienne” (8: 406).&nbsp; For instance, there is 
an account of “le fameux <em>Graman-Quacy</em>” “avec le bel habit et la
 médaille d’or dont le Prince d’Orange lui fit présent … avec sa tête 
chauve et son habillement écarlate et bleu, galonné en or, tel qu’on le 
voit ici à la planche 59” (8: 406).&nbsp; And the young 22' boa snake, 
which was still alive when it was hung up, is described in the text: 
“voyez la planche ci dessus” (8: 409). The four Ferrario plates derived 
from Blake’s represent<br>
Pl. 59 (see <a href="#1">illus. 1</a>): “Graman Quacy etc.,” signed “Bramati f.” at bottom right, “Bramati fec” at bottom left;<br>
Pl. 62 (see <a href="#4">illus. 4</a>):&nbsp;“Planteurs de Surinam,” signed “G. Bramati dis. e inc.” at bottom left, “D. K. Bonatti l’A.T.” at bottom right;<br>
Pl. 63 (see <a href="#10">illus. 10</a>):&nbsp;“Nègres sous un bon maître,” “G. Bramati dis”, “D. K. Bonatti l’A.T.”;<br>
Pl. 65 (see <a href="#12">illus. 12</a>):&nbsp;“Chasseurs Négres [<em>sic</em>] affranchis à la poursuite des rebelles,” signed as in pl. 63.</p>
<p>The anomaly of the celebrated Graman Quacy calmly gazing at the 
viewer rather than watching the sensational scene behind him is 
explained by the fact that in the original he was not even in the same 
volume as the aboma snake—besides, the important feature in <em>Le costume ancien et moderne</em>
 was not officially what they did but what they wore or, in the case of 
the slaves and the snake, what they didn’t wear. In fact, however, the 
text does not focus exclusively or even very extensively on costume, and
 some of the scenes depicted are merely landscapes.&nbsp; Ferrario might
 have appropriately adopted Stedman’s subtitle, <em>Elucidating the 
History of That Country, and Describing Its Productions, viz. 
Quadrupedes, Birds, Fishes, Reptiles, Trees, Shrubs, Fruits, &amp; 
Roots; with an Account of the Indians of Guiana, &amp; Negroes of Guinea
 … Illustrated with … Elegant Engravings</em>.</p>
<p>There are significant differences between Blake’s engravings of “The Celebrated Graman Quacy” (<a href="#2">illus. 3</a>) and “The Skinning of the Aboma Snake” (<a href="#2">illus. 2</a>) and Bramati’s print of “Graman Quacy etc.” (<a href="#1">illus. 1</a>).&nbsp;
 For one thing, Bramati’s hunter, presumably Stedman himself, has picked
 up his gun from where he had left it carelessly leaning against the 
tree, put shoes on (Stedman customarily went barefoot), and turned 
round, so that we can see the powder horn slung across his chest.&nbsp; 
He has also slung on his sword, which he may have been holding in his 
left hand in Blake’s plate.&nbsp; The two naked slaves at the foot of 
the tree have been joined rather awkwardly by a third heaving on the 
snake-line with his back to the tree.&nbsp; The tree has gained a good 
deal of foliage, the little boat and the water on which it floats are 
gone, the serpent has lost his spots, and his tongue, so ominously 
flickering in Blake’s version, is scarcely visible in Bramati’s.</p>
<p>The celebrated Graman Quacy has been altered even more.&nbsp; His 
silver-headed walking stick has been moved from his left hand to his 
right, his extravagant hat is tucked under his right arm rather than 
flourished in his right hand, his metal shoe buckles are barely visible,
 and he is standing stolidly rather than walking with a fearful and 
ingratiating expression.&nbsp; More strikingly, his background has lost 
its fortress at the right and the house and tree plantation at the left.
 The “poppy field” at which Quacy points in Ferrario (but not in 
Stedman) is the <em>Quessia amara</em>, whose therapeutic benefits he 
pointed out to Europeans and which was therefore named after him. To 
unite the two quite disparate scenes, Bramati has extended Quacy’s 
foreground across that of Stedman and his aboma snake.</p>
<p>The sensational snake and Blake’s busy background have been 
simplified by Bramati to emphasize the costumes, or the lack of 
them.&nbsp; Bramati’s four slaves and the snake appear en déshabillé, 
Stedman’s shirt and Quacy’s nether garment and part of his extravagant 
hat are dark pink in the Fisher copy, Quacy’s coat is dark blue, the 
blossoms are touched with red, and the serpent is pale green. Some 
copies of the first edition of Stedman’s <em>Narrative</em> (1796) were 
commercially colored, but it seems unlikely that the copy of Stedman 
that Bramati copied was colored—or that his colorists cared if it was.</p>
<p>Blake, of course, was a professional artist and Stedman was only an 
enthusiastic amateur.&nbsp;Stedman’s designs do not survive, but it is 
generally assumed that Blake tidied them up and, probably inadvertently,
 Europeanized them.&nbsp; Blake had never seen Surinam or an aboma 
snake, and the poses and features of the individuals are likely to have 
been classicized, especially in the slaves struggling to hoist up the 
snake. Blake and Stedman would doubtless have been as astonished as Bob 
Brandeis and I were to see the sensational or naturalistic scenes of 
Stedman’s <em>Narrative</em> converted to costume fodder.</p>
<p>Graman (Great Man) Quacy was a well-known figure in Surinam who was 
crucially helpful to Stedman in tracing the “Revolted Negroes” to their 
jungle fastnesses.&nbsp; Quacy’s right ear was cut off by an Indian 
chief who was betrayed by him—and in Stedman’s portrait his right ear is
 not visible.  <span class="notecall">Stedman wrote that Quacy “came to 
shew me his fine coat, gold medal, &amp;c. which he had received as a 
present from the Prince of Orange, in Holland.”</span><span class="sidenote">Stedman, <em>Narrative …</em> (London: J. Johnson, 1796) 2: 346.</span>
  Presumably the elegant and odd European clothes and medal that Quacy 
is wearing are from the Prince of Orange.  In their edition of Stedman, 
Richard and Sally Price speculate that the prevalence today of the name 
Quacy in Surinam and the West Indies may be due to the notoriety of 
Graman Quacy. However, this is probably not the case.&nbsp; Many years 
ago, when our daughter Julia took us to a concert by the extraordinary 
West Indian poet and singer Linton Quacy Johnson, I sent him a note 
backstage remarking on the speculation of the Prices.&nbsp; Six months 
later he very kindly replied, suggesting that perhaps the Prices were 
unaware that in the part of Africa from which his people had come, 
“Quacy” means “Sunday,” and <span class="notecall">that children born on Sunday are likely to be named Quacy.</span><span class="sidenote">According to <em>Wikipedia</em> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akan_names" target="_blank">Akan names</a>),
 among the Akan people of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, children are 
frequently named after days of the week, such as “Kwesi” for Sunday.</span></p>

Ferrario pl. 62, “Planteurs de Surinam” (<a href="#4">illus. 4</a>), has
 a particularly intricate iconographical background.&nbsp; The woman at 
the left is Stedman’s wife/mistress, the fifteen-year-old Joanna, 
represented in Stedman pl. 8 (<a href="#5">illus. 5</a>), reversed, with new decorations in her hair.&nbsp; <span class="notecall">The Stedman print is described merely as “A Female Mulatto”</span><span class="sidenote">Mulatto, from the Spanish mulato, mule, is an individual with one black and one white parent.</span> in the directions for placing the plates.&nbsp;The woman beside her with a hat is the <span class="notecall">“Female Quadroon Slave of Surinam,”</span><span class="sidenote">A quadroon had one black grandparent, and an octoroon is the offspring of a white and a quadroon.</span> engraved by Perry for Stedman pl. 32 (<a href="#5">illus 6</a>).
 Clearly the Stedman prints were to illustrate in part the distinction 
between mulatto and quadroon. In Ferrario her position has been 
reversed.<br>

The almost-nude woman hanging from a tree is adapted from Stedman’s pl. 35, <span class="notecall">“Flagellation of a Female Samboe Slave,”</span><span class="sidenote">A sambo was an individual with mixed black, Indian, and white blood.&nbsp; Later the term became intensely pejorative.</span> engraved by Blake (<a href="#7">illus. 7</a>).&nbsp;
 In Ferrario her breast is not in profile and the positions of the 
whippers have been altered. The slave being beaten may be adapted from 
Stedman’s pl. 71, “The Execution of Breaking on the Rack,” not signed 
but attributed to Blake (<a href="#7">illus. 8</a>).&nbsp; In Ferrario, 
the victim is standing, not prone, and there are two executioners. The 
man smoking a pipe and the bare-breasted woman pouring his morning 
potation is Stedman’s pl. 49, “A Surinam Planter in His Morning Dress,” 
engraved by Blake (<a href="#7">illus. 9</a>).&nbsp; He has been placed 
in an arcade that has no precedent in Stedman but may be characteristic 
of Milan, where Ferrario’s plate was engraved.

<p class="clear">Ferrario pl. 63, “Nègres sous un bon maître” (<a href="#10">illus. 10</a>), is copied from Blake’s “Family of Negro Slaves from Loango” (<a href="#11">illus. 11</a>),
 reversed, with a reclining nude added in the background at left and a 
precipitous cliff at right in order to convert the portrait shape to 
landscape format.&nbsp; The woman is more European in Ferrario, her 
clothes are the same pattern in Blake but the skirt is blue and the top 
white in Ferrario, her pipe has much more smoke, the toddler is between 
the adults, and the Ferrario man looks directly at the woman.&nbsp; The 
scene is described in Ferrario 8: 433.&nbsp; Ferrario says little of bad
 slave-masters and does not reproduce Blake’s “A Negro Hung Alive by the
 Ribs to a Gallows,” Stedman pl. 11.

Pl. 65, “Chasseurs Négres [<em>sic</em>] affranchis à la poursuite des rebelles” (<a href="#12">illus. 12</a>), adapts Blake’s “A Coromantyn Free Negro, or Ranger, Armed” (<a href="#13">illus. 13</a>),
 with a bayonet added, plus soldiers coming up the crest of a hill to 
the right and omitting the background. The rebarbative individual to the
 left is apparently adapted from “A Rebel Negro Armed &amp; on His 
Guard” (<a href="#13">illus. 14</a>), his head and left arm lowered; the
 ax, at his left side in Ferrario, is at his right side in Stedman. The 
middle thug is closely related to the one at the left, but the third has
 no precedent in Stedman.&nbsp; The skull and bone are from “A Negro 
Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows.” The scene is described in Ferrario
 8: 437.&nbsp; The single ranger is clad in a red bandanna and buff 
trousers in the Fisher copy.

<p>Blake’s father and brother kept a hosiery and haberdashery shop over 
which he was born and where he lived for at least the first fourteen 
years of his life, and he would have been familiar with the ambitions 
and vagaries of sartorial fashion.&nbsp; As a professional engraver, he 
made prints such as those for Stedman that incidentally represented the 
costumes of Australia, England, France, Greece (ancient), the Holy Land,
 Italy (Roman and Renaissance), the South Pacific, Spain, and 
Surinam.&nbsp; However, the only explicit fashion plates he made were 
the two that represented “The Morning Amusements of Her Royal Highness 
the Princess Royal &amp; Her 4 Sisters” and “A Lady in the Full Dress, 
&amp; Another in the Most Fashionable Undress Now Worn” for the <em>Ladies New and Polite Pocket Memorandum Book</em>&nbsp;for 1783 (1782).</p>
<p>The only other engravings by Blake that are known to have been copied in Blake’s time outside Britain were in Lavater, <em>Aphorisms</em> (Dublin, 1790) and the fourth edition (Boston and Worcester [Massachusetts], 1790), William Hayley, <em>The Life of William Cowper</em> (New York, 1803), copying Blake’s plates in the London edition of that year, and Marie Vollstonecraft, <em>Marie et Caroline</em> (Paris, 1799), copying Blake’s engravings after his own designs for Mary Wollstonecraft’s <em>Original Stories</em> (1791, 1796).</p>
