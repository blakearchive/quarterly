        <p>On the cover is a drawing by Bo Lindberg of the Blakes in Abo, Finland, in 1824. Lindberg had this
to say about the drawing:
<q>In 1974 the oldest surviving Finnish newspaper, <hi rend="i">Abo Underrättelser</hi> (published in
Swedish, formerly the language of the Finnish intelligensia, and still spoken by many Finns), celebrated its
150th anniversary. The editor asked me to make a drawing of Abo in 1824, showing people reading the first
copies of the <hi rend="i">Abo Underrättelser</hi>, and, in the background, the Cathedral, the old town
center, and the bridge across the River Aura with the small kiosk on it—from this kiosk the newspaper was
sold. None of the buildings except the Gothic Cathedral survived the great fire of 1827.<lb/>
The Abo of the early 19th century was “a most infamous pit, a pestified place, having a poisoned atmosphere,
poor pavements and the worst ‘esprit public’ in the world,” wrote Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt about 1800. Since
Blake was in the habit of visiting infamous places such as Babylon and Hell, he must have made a spiritual
journey to Abo—and, since a spirit is not a cloudy vapour or a nothing, his spirit must have had a solid
body, resembling his mortal body. Further, it is well known that Catherine partook in her husband’s visions.
Therefore I put William Blake and his wife among the readers of the first issue of <hi rend="i">Abo
Underrättelser.</hi> Their clothes are more or less right for 1824.
</q></p>
        <p>Lindberg had this to say about himself:
<q>
Name. Bo Lindberg, called Ossian. I’m an artist, ethnological draughtsman and art historian, born in Abo in
1937, at present working at the University of Lund, Sweden. In 1973 my Ph.D. thesis, <hi rend="i">William
Blake’s Illustrations to the Book of Job</hi>, was published in the <hi rend="i">Acta Academiae
Aboensis.</hi> I’ve published a few papers about Blake, Bosch, the Cathedral of Abo, etc. I’ve translated
part of Blake’s poetry into Swedish, but so far only <hi rend="i">The Mental Traveller</hi> has appeared in
print.<lb/>
I’ve modernised Satan’s Holy Trinity: Darwin, Marx and Einstein, and the prophet of the tripartite God is
Freud. I believe that art and science are the foundation of empire. Hitler, Stalin, Roosevelt, etc., attend
upon and follow scientists, writers and prophets like Darwin, Marx, Einstein, etc., which shows that Blake was
right again.<lb/>
I like Blake because his philosophy is too complicated and too truthful for political, economic and
bureaucratic leaders to use it and misuse it. In this world it is a great merit merely to be harmless.
</q></p>
        <p>Most of the illustrations in this issue are from Blake’s contributions to the extra-illustrated
Shakespeare folio complied by the Rev. Joseph Thomas. The volume was sold by his descendants to Alexander
Macmillan in 1880, from whose family it was acquired by the British Museum in 1880. The pictures are
reproduced here by permission of the Trustees of the British Museum.</p>
