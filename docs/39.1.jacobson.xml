          <p>Blake’s <hi rend="i">Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi> contains a section entitled Proverbs of
Hell. This section, like the work as a whole, contains sharp satiric, even parodic, elements directed against
the Bible, Blake’s devotion to Scripture notwithstanding.
<pb id="p39-49" n="49"/>
One of the proverbs therein is “The nakedness of woman is the work of God.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n87" type="note">1</ref> Strangely, as far as I know, no one has noted the sharp—one
might say polemical—relationship of this aphorism to a famous passage in Paul’s first Letter to the
Corinthians: “Every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head; for
that is even all one as if she were shaven. For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn; but if it
be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. For a man indeed ought not to cover his
head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god: but the woman is the glory of the man”
(11:5-7).<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n88" type="note">2</ref> “The woman is the glory
of the man.” Paul’s aphoristic structure is kept by Blake: “The nakedness of woman is the work of
God.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n89" type="note">3</ref> Paul’s injunction that
women need to keep their hair covered is countered by Blake’s overriding praise of the naked woman. While
Paul condemns the baring of a woman’s head, Blake lauds her presence with no coverings at all. This
rejection of Paul is another example of what Bloom calls “Blake’s Proverbs exist[ing] to break down
orthodox categories of thought and morality.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n90"
