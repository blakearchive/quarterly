                    <p>The fame and influence of Blake’s designs to Blair’s
                            <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (1808) are indicated in a modest way in <hi rend="i">The
Pictorial Edition of The Book of Common Prayer</hi>
                            [1838],<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n98" type="note">1</ref>
generously pointed out to
                        me by my colleague Professor Peter Morgan. The work is remarkable for over
                        750 small woodcuts, mostly vignette capitals and rather larger chapter
                        headings. The engravings are anonymous, but the authorship of most of the
                        designs is attributed in the “List of Illustrations” to
                        artists such as Raffaelle, Rubens, Tintoretto, and Lebrun, with a scattering
                        of more recent designers such as Reynolds, Westall, and Flaxman (eight
                        designs, chiefly from his <hi rend="i">Lord’s Prayer</hi> [1835]
                        ). The only Blake in the “List” is on p. 192:
                        “Initial letter—Christ with the keys of Hell and
                        Death.—Blake” (3.5 × 4.0 cm). The design
                        (illus. 1 here) is made so small and conventional as to be scarcely
                        recognizable as Blake’s for the plate called “Christ
                        descending into the Grave” (see illus. 2); the focus on Christ is
                        diminished, the facial features are made simpler and conventional, and the
                        distracting horizontal and diagonal lines of the capital
                        “A” entirely alter the force of Blake’s design.

                            <p>The engravings are attributed, without evidence, to John Jackson
                                (1801-48) by Percy Muir, <hi rend="i">Victorian Illustrated
                                    Books</hi> (1971), who also reproduces the larger of the two

                                design.”</p>
                            <p>John Jackson thought well enough of Blake to write an account of him
                                in Jackson [&amp; William A. Chatto], <hi rend="i">A Treatise
                                    on Wood Engraving, Historical and Practical</hi> (1839), 715-17.
                                and to reproduce as a frontispiece to the edition of 1861 (reprinted
                                Detroit, 1969) the Blake design of “Death’s
                                Door” for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>
                                engraved by W. J. Linton. This plate had previously appeared to
                                illustrate Anon., “Death and Immortality,” <hi rend="i">Illustrated Exhibitor
and Magazine of Art</hi>, 1 (12

                                proof is in The British Museum Print Room. Linton later made the
                                facsimile illustrations for Gilchrist’s <hi rend="i">Life
                                    of William Blake, “Pictor Ignotus”</hi> (1863)
                                and used the design from Blake’s <hi rend="i">Europe</hi>
                                (1794) pl. 12 for his own <hi rend="i">Famine: A Masque</hi>

                    <p>Far more interesting is the border to the design of Rubens’
                        “Resurrection” (illus. 3) serving as the headpiece to
                        “The Collect” on p. 199 (11.0 × 13.7 cm). The
                        border is not identified in the “List of Illustrations,”
                        but it is unmistakably taken from the engraved titlepage to
                        Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (illus. 4) and the design of
                        “The Death of The Good Old Man” (illus. 5) for
                        Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave.</hi> At the bottom of the border is
                        the skeleton faithfully copied (reversed) from the Blair titlepage. To the
                        right is the plunging trumpeter from the Blair titlepage, with clouds added
                        at the bottom and some trailing drapery obscuring his genitals. (The hands
                        and feet are somewhat altered from Blake.) At the left is the same figure,
                        reversed, with some added background clouds and the tactful omission of the
                        genitals. At the top are the two angels conducting the soul of The Good Old
                        Man to heaven, fairly carefully repeated, reversed, from “The Death
                        of The Good Old Man” (illus.

                        at their call at the bottom, and at the top we see two other angels (or

                            <head>5 Blake’s design for “The Death of The Good
                                Old Man” for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>
                                (1808) engraved by Schiavonetti.</head>
                        </figure> and intention are not Blake’s, but they are not
                        entirely inconsistent with his either.</p>
                    <p>Blake’s designs to Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> were
                        printed in 1808 (twice), 1813, and 1826, but since in all printings before
                        1830 the designs were scarcely altered, it is not possible to say which
                        edition was being copied in the 1838 <hi rend="i">Common Prayer.</hi> The
                        1838 borders do, however, bear one striking similarity to the new editions
                        of Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> of 1847 and 1858 with new
                        plates after Blake engraved by A. L. Dick. In Dick’s version of
                        the Blair titlepage, the plunging trumpeter is delicately draped with a wisp
                        of unattached <corr type="emend">diaphanous</corr> veil, as in the 1838 design. James
Montgomery, who
                        subscribed to the 1808 edition of Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>, found that
“several of the plates were hardly of such
                        a nature as to render the book proper to lie on a parlour table for general
                        inspection,” and Robert Hunt complained in <hi rend="i">The
                            Examiner</hi> for 7 August 1808 that “an appearance of
                        libidinousness [<hi rend="i">in the Blair designs</hi>] intrudes itself upon
                        the holiness of our thoughts.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n99"

                        Regency and Victorian sensibility evidently required changes in
                        Blake’s vision, and in the 1838, 1847, and 1858 versions of
                        Blake’s titlepage for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>
                        the trumpeter seems to have stooped to truth and moralized his song. <note id="n99">
