          <title type="main">Blake and His Circle: An Annotated Checklist of Recent
            Publications</title>
        </head>
        <byline>By <docAuthor>D. W. <name>Dörrbecker</name></docAuthor></byline>
        <p>In a letter to Clare Sydney Smith, dated 6 March 1932, T. E. Shaw reported on the
          progress he was then making with the compilation of his <hi rend="i">Notes of the 200
            Class</hi>, a handbook for the use of the Royal Air Force’s power boats. Along with the
          author of <hi rend="i">Seven Pillars of Wisdom</hi>, I too may say: “Ever so dull, these
          bibliographical notes, and entirely impersonal. Nobody could guess that anybody had
          written them. They seem just to have collected themselves.” However, the sheer number of
          entries which, year after year, “collect themselves” in these annual reports on the
          current state of Blake scholarship is quite amazing. Thirteen years after the publication
          of <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, G. E. Bentley’s dictum that “Blake has become a
          growth-industry” still holds true. However, while we have been witnessing a change from a
          cottage industry to what threatens to be a factory one, there certainly seems to be no
          shortage of new approaches for analyzing and understanding (or, at least, for describing
          in revolutionary new terminologies) Blake’s works as an engraver, painter, and poet.</p>
        <p>I worked on the present edition of this continuing report on “Blake and His Circle” both
          at the University of Rochester Library and the Huntington Library in March 1989, and at
          Trier University Library from May to August 1989. Chronologically, coverage in this year’s
          checklist runs roughly parallel with the publication of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>’s volume
          22. As before, I have not interpreted the term “recent publications” in its narrowest
          sense, and I list articles and reviews published as long ago as 1980. Many 1988 issues of
          scholarly journals were inaccessible to me while being bound; these will be examined and
          the results included in next year’s checklist.</p>
        <p>Readers will note a few changes in the organization and selection of material. While in
          character and coverage part I remains essentially the same, I have now decided to merge
          former parts II (Blake’s Circle) and III (Related Interest). Their respective contents
          have been reorganized into three main sections that make up what is now part II: 
            <hi rend="i">general studies</hi> of the history, art, and literature of Blake’s times,
          arranged alphabetically by author; this is followed by a list of books and articles on
          some of Blake’s contemporaries (the “inner” and “outer” circles in which he moved), which
          is keyed to the names of the <hi rend="i">authors and artists</hi> who are the subject of
          the respective studies. The third and shortest section of part II is a 
            <hi rend="i">miscellany</hi> (again alphabetized by author rather than subject); it mostly records
          contributions that have some bearing on our knowledge of the history of Blake studies.
          While for this section I ignored, for example, Kathleen Raine’s “Recent Poems” (as I have
          skipped her latest book, <hi rend="i">The Presence</hi>, and associated reviews), I have
          included a dissertation concerned with the literary traditions at work in the same
          author’s creative writing since I assume that such a study will contain some discussion of
          Raine’s indebtedness to Blake or Thomas Taylor.</p>
        <p>While I shall continue to attempt “absolute inclusiveness” in part I, the other sections
          of this current checklist will now be treated more selectively than in previous years. In
          the future, I will not include <hi rend="i">every</hi> essay on Cowper that I happen to
          track down, nor will I try to list every review of a study of, say, West. For this year’s
          checklist, I have disregarded various articles and dissertations concerned with Cowper,
          Godwin, West, and Wollstonecraft. Since no other bibliographical aid to research that is
          known to me gives easy access to the few books, catalogues, and articles published
          annually on Barry, Calvert, Cromek, George Cumberland, Erasmus Darwin (the study of whose
          scientific works mostly goes unnoticed in, say, the <hi rend="i">MLA International
            Bibliography</hi>), Flaxman, Fuseli, Hayley, Linnell, Mortimer, Palmer, Richmond,
          Romney, Stothard, Swedenborg, Thomas Taylor, and Varley, these will still be featured with
          as few omissions as possible. However, publications concerned with Cowper’s poetry and his
          letters in general, with Godwin’s novels (as opposed to his political and philosophical
          writings), with the non-British periods in Paine’s or Priestley’s political careers, with
          some highly specialized questions concerning the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft or the
          art of Angelica Kauffmann, or Benjamin West, etc., will not be represented in these
          reports in the future. Such partial selectiveness will allow me to supply more extensive
          annotations to the entries in part I, similar to those in the present issue.</p>
        <p>Most of these notes are—or at least are meant to be—descriptive; with only a few
          sentences, often employing 
<pb id="p23-121" n="121"/>
quotations from the authors
          themselves, I have tried to give some idea of what to expect from a closer reading.
          Readers will be aware that with the limited space available for such annotation I may have
          occasionally misrepresented an author’s intentions. And yet, I hope that my brief
          summaries will function as a temptation to study more of a book or an essay, rather than
          as an attempt to smother the expectations raised by any given title. However, a few notes
          have grown into miniature reviews where I thought it permissible to include some critical
          remarks of my own, and not all of them are entirely appreciative. While I certainly mean
          what I say, these, too, should not be taken as authoritative; they simply record one
          reader’s more or less spontaneous (and possibly biased) reaction to the arguments
          presented.</p>
        <p>Beginning with the 1989-1990 checklist, the same general principles for selecting the
          entries in parts I and II will be applied to the reviews section. Especially since they
          often make some independent contribution to our knowledge of the subject and will be
          important for any attempt to describe and understand the history and progress of Blake
          studies, I shall continue to list all the reviews of books that are directly concerned
          with the poet-painter’s works. Reviews for books in part II will be treated more
          selectively, excluding, for example, reviews that in no way touch on the Blakean interest
          that was initially responsible for my decision to list the title. Occasionally, however,
          it may seem appropriate to include one of the short book notes from a monthly publication
          such as <hi rend="i">Choice</hi> even for these studies if no other and more comprehensive
          review of a recently published monograph is known to me.</p>
        <p>It is for the benefit of those readers of the annual checklists who use them as a
          reference tool that I have included a list of corrigenda to previous editions of “Blake
          and His Circle” following the index to this year’s report. The reason for most of the
          corrections is that a considerable number of publications were examined only 
            <hi rend="i">after</hi> their checklist entries had appeared in print. I hope that readers will
not
          only appreciate these corrections but, at the same time, pardon any errors in the present
          list.</p>
        <p>While I remain responsible for whatever mistakes that remain, it is, as always, a
          pleasure to record the help I have received from various publishing houses as well as from
          many of my colleagues who have supplied me with inspection copies or offprints. Special
          mention is due to David Alexander, Kiyoshi Ando, G. E. Bentley, Jr., Peter Brier, Howard
          Brogan, Martin Butlin, Andrew Cooper, Pierre Danchin, Morris Eaves, Robert Essick (who, in
          addition to other favors, has kindly granted permission to reproduce an engraving from his
          collection), David Fuller, Frederick Garber, Alexander Gourlay, Christopher Heppner, John
          J. Joyce, Georg Kamp, Desmond King-Hele, Vibeke Knudsen, Jenijoy La Belle, Paul Mann,
          James McCord, Anne Mellor, Jeanne Moskal, Morton Paley, François Piquet, Kathleen Raine,
          Dennis Read, Sheila Spector, Michael Tolley, Pam van Schaik, Joseph Viscomi, Dennis Welch,
          and David Worrall, all of whom have made important contributions to the present issue of
          this continuing guide to current Blake scholarship.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Patricia Neill has tactfully copyedited my typescript and checked it for
          continuity. (As before, our house style is based—with only a few exceptions that have been
          explained in previous issues of the checklist—on <hi rend="i">The MLA Style Manual</hi> of
          1985.) She has thus given me every kind of assistance with seeing the present issue of
          “Blake and His Circle” through the press, and her efforts are greatly appreciated by the
          compiler. Special thanks are also due to Josefine Simon who has efficiently translated my
          ideas for the illustrations which accompany this year’s list into reproducible
          photographs.</p>
        <p>Finally, let me say that I am sadly convinced that probably all too many publications in
          the field have been overlooked; I will be most grateful, then, if readers point out any
          such omissions that may remain for inclusion in a future edition of <hi rend="i">Blake/An
            Illustrated Quarterly</hi>’s annual bibliographical reports.

          sources.</hi></note></p>

              from Blake’s writings is certainly much bigger than Bronowski’s which it is designed

              recently rediscovered second Blake-Varley sketchbook which contains some 50 previously

              (i.e., Laura M. C. Keen), and besides seven reproductions of Varley’s architectural
              and landscape studies, 56 pages with Blake’s drawings and the original binding of the
              sketchbook are reproduced. The seriousness and professionalism of Blake’s
              draftsmanship in this second series of “visionary heads” will certainly come as a

              diction and rhythms—a comparison of Blake and Goethe may provide material for an
              eventual reformulation of our thinking about the Romantic era as a whole” (xi). This
              study then is not concerned with “provable ‘influence’ as a basis for literary
              comparison,” with “cause-and-effect relationships,” but with “deep-rooted affinities
              between contemporary introspective explorers,” with “spiritual kinships—expressed in
              similar ideas, myths, and metaphors—[which offer] a stimulus to both the analytic
              understanding and the synthesizing imagination” (xii). To do so, Bidney surveys “a

              that in Blake, the Father is Milton, the Son is Blake, who is a profound reduction of
              Milton and the Bible, and the Holy Ghost of inspiration is a not wholly persuasive
              special pleading. Blake . . . could not ruin the sacred truths, either to fable and
              old song, or to a story that might emerge clearly from the abyss of his own strong
              ego, as it emerged from Wordsworth. . . . Blake is one of the last of an old race of
              poets; Wordsworth was the very first of the race of poets that we have with us still”

              observations of human dynamics; the resulting interaction depicted in his myth

              understanding of Sir Joshua Reynold’s [sic] idea of general nature. The young Blake
              rejected as his intellectual sources the rules, rationalism, and general nature of
              Reynolds and other Enlightenment thinkers . . . Given his [i.e., Blake’s] emphasis on
              minute particulars, why does so much of his imagery seem stereotypical? For Blake, it

              [Part 2 of this chapter is subtitled “Visual Metaphor and Literal Misreading in Blake”
              (65-76) and is devoted to a scrutinizing examination of text and design in “The Fly.”
              This is part of what I see as an important attempt to “describe strategies common to
              poetry and painting for engaging readers and observers” (1). On account of the vast
              diversity of the materials dealt with, the results do not always live up to the
              standards established by the Blake chapter. Analyzing works by Arnold, Blake (mostly
              from the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>), Browning, Constable, Egg, Gainsborough, Gillray,
              Hogarth, Holman Hunt, Lawrence, Leighton, Marvell, Millais, Pope, Reynolds, Romney,
              Rossetti, Turner, and Wordsworth et al., Cohen wants to describe how the reader and/or
              viewer, suspending disbelief, is drawn into the fictional reality of time and space as
              represented in poetry and painting. “The experience [of engagement] begins with a
              sense of being in the work and includes a conviction that the subject of the work
              matters; the engaged observer also accedes to a demand for some response—intellectual,
              moral, or emotional” (1). The discussion of Blake’s particular achievement in shaping
              his “engagement strategies” starts out from the observation that comparison “is the
              poet’s most useful tool for engaging an audience,” and asks whether there is “a direct
              visual equivalent to the battery of comparative techniques the poet has at his or her
              disposal” (49). Therefore, “The Fly” is studied to “illustrate Blake’s use of metaphor
              whose terms are spread across the verbal and visual parts of his plate and the ways in
              which he relies on the engaged observer to connect his words and design” (66). This
              leads to a critique of previous “Misreadings” which merely tried “to adjust the
              symbolic import in the actions of the three figures to fit the meaning of the text”
              (68) and which precluded the realization of the particular “synthesis of the two arts”
              (66) that, according to Cohen, is to take place in the viewer. “The reader/observer’s
              engagement with the poem and design begins at the point where the speaker identifies
              himself with the fly in stanza 2. From there, a successive identification with each of
              the figures leads to assent to the speaker’s conclusions in the last stanzas” (76).
              The concluding chapters of the book (177-87) attempt to show that engagement is a
              useful and important category for the definition of what Pevsner termed the
              “Englishness” of English art. Since authors and artists in Britain during the
              eighteenth and nineteenth centuries considered the engagement of their readers and
              viewers as essential for the social functioning of their works, and since they shared
              “the conviction that art must connect with the moral life” (186) of society at large,
              success or failure in engaging the audience (as opposed to the autonomy of
              aestheticism) became a measure and criterion of value in art and its theory. It is at
              this point that Cohen’s study of models of reader/observer responses links up with
              both Erdman’s “Historical Approach” and Barrell’s or Eaves’s analyses of artistic
              theory.]</p>

              pointed out that there also are numerous other references to Blake throughout this
              study of the “two quite different forms of doubt” which—according to the “premise of
              this book”—were produced by eighteenth-century “sensationalist psychology” (1), and
              these discussions of Blake are here presented in a new context. Besides 
                <hi rend="i">Milton</hi>, Cooper examines Byron’s <hi rend="i">Don Juan</hi>, Coleridge’s 
                <hi rend="i">Christabel</hi>, and Shelley’s <hi rend="i">Alastor</hi>—for yoking
              together these texts which might “seem an exceedingly diverse group” (6), Cooper gives
              the following reasons. First, he finds these narrative poems united in the “common
              assumption . . . not that physical experience is always exhilarating but that
              alienation from one’s body . . . and also from the realm of the bodily and from the
              processes of embodiment in general is always damaging” (2); second, the poems
              “actually dramatize the process of representation by which their epistemological
              crisis is brought before the reader” (3); third, the “technique of repeating
              subnarratives” in the four poems “elicits a mounting awareness of the poem’s
              textuality which then works to counter the escapist tendencies of the Romantic
              imagination” (4), and, he says, his study was prompted by “the perception that 
                <hi rend="i">Milton, Christabel</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Alastor</hi> do not make
              narrative sense if approached any <hi rend="i">other</hi> way” than that provided by
              “reader-response theory” (5). See also the subsequent entry.]</p>

              Oxford, Oxon.: Clarendon P, 1989. $55.00 cloth. [During the past two decades or so,
              the author has certainly revolutionized both our factual knowledge of Blake’s
              printmaking processes and of their hermeneutical implications for the interpretation
              of his graphic works. With the present study, Essick (re)turns to the printer-poet’s
              other medium, language; <pb id="p23-130" n="130"/>
there, he “situate[s] Blake within
              the history of language theory” and “generate[s] a hermeneutic on the basis of that
              history” (2). In this sense, then, his “book is an attempt to complete the circle of
              influence by returning to Blake’s writings and bringing to the study of their language
              a perspective informed by what we have learned from the study of his graphics and the
              media-consciousness they have raised” (1). In the first chapter (6-27) four of Blake’s
              tempera paintings are employed to reconstruct “several types of signs, both fallen and
              ideal” (3), which were used by Blake the artist to comment on the phenomena of
              language and its history. The second chapter (28-103) presents a detailed history of
              “the ideal of a motivated sign as the origin and telos of language” (3). A third
              chapter (104-59) is concerned with “Blake’s use [and later rejection] of natural
              signs, primarily in his earlier poetry” (3). Blake’s literary “production practices”
              and “the relationship of language ideal to language performance as symbiosis rather
              than disjunction” (3-4) are the subject of the book’s fourth chapter (160-94). The
              final chapter (195-236) discusses “Blake’s imagining of a post-apocalyptic language,”
              replacing “transcendence with incarnation, sublimation with immanence, and questions
              about how far even an ideal language can become a transparent medium of something
              other than itself with questions about how far that other is a reified projection of
              the medium” (4-5). An afterword (237-39) is concerned with those “more general
              historical and methodological concerns” (237) which by necessity tend to be pushed to
              the background in any monograph on one single author such as this. After we have had
              such books as Ostriker’s, Holloway’s, and especially Hilton’s, the present volume
              confronts us with yet another and entirely original approach to Blake’s use of and
              thinking about language as the poet’s medium.]</p>

              the manuscript, the visual and verbal parallels of its imagery in Blake’s works
              (particularly of the late 1780s and 1790s), and a discussion of the technique of
              drawing and lettering used to create the manuscript as well as of its probable date of
              execution. This is followed by a critique of Keynes’s “methodology of
              attribution/interpretation” (378), a statement on the manuscript poem’s authenticity,
              and some more general considerations concerning the procedures of attribution. “The
              case for attributing ‘The Phoenix’ to Blake as its author, calligrapher, and
              illustrator is very solid. . . . The crucial pieces of evidence are those which it
              would be most difficult for a forger to manufacture: the techniques used to execute
              the manuscript and its history of ownership. The conclusion drawn from these primary
              arguments is buttressed by the manuscript’s more easily imitable pictorial and verbal
              structures, . . . ‘The Phoenix’ should be included in the canon of Blake’s poetry. The
              illuminated manuscript, a unique companion to Blake’s printed illuminated books,
              should be added to the catalogue of his watercolor drawings” (376). Reproduces the

              approaches offered here” (x). For closely related articles see #118 and 171,

              limitations of innocence and artistic creation in a fallen world” (69). The essential

              cloth. [As is stated in the 1988 postscript to the introduction, “this study was
              completed more than twenty years ago,” and the author appears to be aware of the fact
              that since 1967 “much has happened in Blake scholarship that has augmented [her]
              perspective or offered new insights. But [?] given the context in which this is being
              published [probably the ‘context’ of the Garland series; DWD] it seems inappropriate
              to include new material or to change to more inclusive language.” In consequence of
              such lucid reasoning, Mary Starritt Hall decided to simply leave “this study in the
              form in which it was submitted to the English faculty of Princeton in 1967” as her
              doctoral thesis (6; see Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, 1977, #1775). What
              readers ought to expect then is a brand new contribution to late 60s Blake
              scholarship. Chapter 1 studies Blake’s sources and acquaintances in order to supply an
              outline of his critique of society and its current ideology in <hi rend="i">An Island

              thinking (such as Bryant’s <hi rend="i">Analysis</hi>), are the subject of the second
              chapter (44-75); next comes an investigation into “different aspects of The Human
              Illusion” (76) that Hall finds represented in <hi rend="i">Urizen, Ahania</hi> and 
                <hi rend="i">The Book of Los</hi>, where Blake is said to have drawn critically on such
              authors as Monboddo and (the constantly misspelled) “Priestly” (76-120); “a night by
              night analysis” (121) of <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi> follows in chapter 4
              (121-92); with an exposition of the “direct and consistent attack on materialism”
              (235) in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> in the concluding chapter (193-235) “this study has
              come full circle” (193). While there is reason to doubt that the author has actually
              seen and used <hi rend="i">all</hi> the titles listed in her impressive bibliography
              (236-60), she has certainly brought a wealth of reading in both primary and secondary
              literature to her task. It is as a compendium of Blake’s possible sources in
              contemporary literature (mostly natural philosophy) that this otherwise unattractive
              reproduction of a dated thesis may still be useful.]</p>

                <hi rend="i">The Gates of Paradise</hi> (230-34) in the light of the verbal
              specification that Blake supplied by the various titles and inscriptions which he
              assigned to these designs in different states. Heppner argues that “with the years
              Blake felt a stronger urge to specify meanings verbally, rather than allow visual
              images simply to mean in their own way and within their own limits of explicitness. .
              . . Blake felt free to redefine the sense of his images, to activate relational
              structures potential or implicit in them, but undeveloped by the titles or texts first
              associated with them” (229-30). The article presents the challenging conclusion that
              “Blake did not understand his designs to be univocal containers of explicit meaning,
              but rather generators of a semantic energy which could be further defined and directed
              by titles and texts. . . . There are two possible explanations of what happened, both
              probably true. One is that Blake in practice lost a degree of faith in the
              communicative power of his designs, perhaps as a result of experiencing the
              incomprehension of viewers. . . . The other explanation is that the texts which Blake
              in his later career associates with his designs should be treated as a kind of
              interpretive game, which he plays in conjunction with the viewer” (234-35). In
              addition, however, it might be argued that over the years and in the medium of
              language Blake similarly felt free to define and redefine the meaning of specific
              elements and characters of his myth, just as he changed or specified the meaning of
              some of his visual motifs.]</p>

              content were not of equal importance when acquiring Blake’s water color paintings; for
              him, “the main consideration would probably have been the unfolding meaning of the
              series as a biblical sequence” (21). While I am not entirely convinced that this is
              what can safely be assumed with respect to an eighteenth- or nineteenth-century
              collector, in consequence the author approaches the designs iconographically as “a
              biblical commentary in pictorial form,” and demonstrates how they “bring out a pattern
              of loss and recovery familiar to readers of Blake’s poetry: Humankind loses the divine
              vision; man and woman fall into estrangement; in the fullness of time, they awaken to
              a sense of shared identity with the ‘Divine Humanity,’ whom they come to recognize as
              an inward presence. Repeated motifs, especially the recurring depictions of human
              encounters with the divine, help to unify the series and order the illustrations as a
              visionary sequence” (20). Therefore, the article concentrates on Blake’s typological
              interpretation of Old Testament passages. There is to be a sequel to the present study
              which presumably will treat the New Testament subjects in the series commissioned by

              rebellion; his stolen fire, a symbol of illegitimate power. This dissertation asserts
              that in <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost, The Four Zoas</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Prometheus
                Unbound</hi>, the English poets Milton, Blake, and Shelley exploit the myth for
              their respective views on tyrant and rebel, power and impotence, revolution and the
              status quo. Evidence from political treatises the poets read (and those they wrote),
              along with examples from the visual arts, are used to focus on the Titan as heroic or
              demonic rebel. . . . To the Romanticists Blake and Shelley, tyrant and rebel are
              psychic states. Both revise Milton’s Titanism to reject illegitimate patriarchal
              power, human or divine. In <hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, Blake challenges first the
              rebel Orc, then the tyrant Urizen to overthrow the excesses within the human psyche

              (£25.00) cloth/$8.50 (£4.95) paper. [Following an “Introduction” (11-15) which gives a
              brief general account of “how a Blakean engraved book was created” (10), the first
              part of the book surveys previous editorial and interpretative scholarship (17-56).
              The author then presents a series of his own close readings of eight of the poems in
              the second part of the book (57-84). These attempt to demonstrate that the particular
              meanings of the poems which have been perceived by Lindsay’s predecessors and “which
              at first seem incompatible often prove on closer examination to be complementary”
              (57). Among the 57 critics engaged in the debate as it is here mapped by the author,
              Damon, Erdman, Frye, Gardner, Gillham, Glen, Hirsch, Keynes, Leader, Raine, and
              Wicksteed figure most prominently. Despite many omissions and the author’s failure to
              give an adequate picture of the varying interests which shaped the historical process
              of interpreting and reinterpreting Blake’s poetry, Lindsay’s attempt to draw together
              some of the major or “representative” strands of criticism concerned with the 
                <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> may nevertheless offer a welcome aid to future research. The
              sparse bibliographic “References” (85-88) list no more than seven articles on the 
                <hi rend="i">Songs</hi> that have been published in scholarly journals, they quote some
              outdated editions, and while he is perfectly aware of the radical differences between
              early and late copies of the book (see 13-14), Lindsay makes mention of only one
              facsimile reproduction of the <hi rend="i">Songs.</hi> Taking up less than 75 pages,
              his encouragement to participate “as the critics debate” (9) certainly is anything but
              long-winded. The ardent fervor to condense the “Survey” of the critical debate and the
              “Appraisal” of Blake’s poetry as much as possible may have to be attributed to the
              format of the series rather than to the author’s own decision. In effect, however, it
              may have been responsible not just for the use of an incomplete title for the 
                <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of Experience</hi> throughout the few pages of this
              extravagantly priced pamphlet, but for more serious limitations in the argument and

              Studies in Modern Literature 87. Ann Arbor, MI: UMI Research P, 1988. $44.95 cloth.
              [The book begins with “A Theory of Influence” (1-11), which discusses “two seemingly
              problematic pairings: William Blake and James Joyce, <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and 
                <hi rend="i">Ulysses</hi>” (1), and in which a “self-consciousness about writing and the
              corrective stealing back of writing is the basis of [the author’s] conception of
              influence” (9). McArthur then studies <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> (13-46) and
              investigates the Blake-Joyce “Case of Influence” (47-64). “The evidence demonstrates
              that on both a personal and an historical level Joyce felt a deep sense of kinship for
              the poet who seemed so different from him. This kinship reveals itself in a set of
              figures related to time, space, and the muse in both her domestic and social aspects
              that Joyce borrowed from <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> for [a] 1902 essay . . . and that he
              reused later in crucial passages in both <hi rend="i">A Portrait of the Artist as a
                Young Man</hi> and <hi rend="i">Ulysses.</hi> . . . Joyce was especially struck by
              Blake’s analysis of the artistic dilemma of a writer situated within domestic cycles
              of estrangement and reconciliation and historical cycles of imperialism and
              revolution” (2). In studying the two texts that, on account of “massive differences”
              in stylistic structure and content, at first appear to be “polar opposites” (1),
              McArthur stresses “a series of remarkable parallels . . . Each title indicates a
              relation to an epic poet and a specific epic, <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> and the
                <hi rend="i">Odyssey</hi>, that they will interrogate, take apart, and put back
              together again” (2). The author subsequently applies his findings of structural
              similarities in <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">Ulysses</hi> to an
              interpretation of Joyce’s writing procedures, concentrating on four chapters of
              Joyce’s work (65-146). This book is the published version of McArthur’s thesis, which
              has been listed previously in <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> 21

              “to sketch a theory of historical method for Euro-American literary studies which
              would be grounded in the practice of a critical hermeneutics.” In this context, the
              present publication “argues the critical relevance of the ‘canonical’ literary archive
              for a radical and non-canonical approach to literary studies” (vii). McGann discusses

other
              obligations than to speak for the orders of the state, however liberal and pluralistic
              those orders may be; indeed, to argue that poetic discourse, perhaps more than any
              other of the human sciences, has special resources for carrying out this critical and
              antithetical role, a role which is . . . now sorely needed” (viii). McGann also draws
              the reader’s attention to “Blake’s centrality to this book. . . . Blake’s historical
              position, in particular the antithesis to the line of Kant which his theory and
              practice represented, is a constant focus of attention. Blake’s work—its major themes,
              forms, and polemics—has thus had a significant directorial effect on the way I managed
              my materials” (ix). Therefore, one will also find numerous references to Blake
              scattered throughout those pages of the present study which are not part of the two

              (1988-1989): 171-90. [The author, having laid the foundation in a series of previous
              articles on Cromek, convincingly rehabilitates the publisher of Blake’s Blair designs
              and establishes that because “there is no evidence that Blake was working on his own
                <hi rend="i">Canterbury Pilgrims</hi> before this time [i.e., May 1807], it seems
              very likely that Cromek’s taunt to Blake to paint a better <hi rend="i">Canterbury
                Pilgrims</hi> than Stothard’s is the genesis for Blake’s rival project” (175). The
              article contains a detailed account of the documentary evidence concerning the quarrel
              between Blake and Cromek (some of it new and hitherto unpublished). It also describes
              Cromek’s successful canvassing for subscriptions for the print after Stothard’s
              painting, his advertisements and exhibitions of the painting, and his promotional
              tours of the provinces between 1807 and 1809. In addition, Read suggests that in 
                <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> Blake’s Satan ought to be identified with Cromek (see 183), and
              that the Miller and the Plowman in Blake’s Chaucerian design contain cryptic portraits
              of Cromek and Blake himself (see 180-81) that serve as a visual analogue to “Blake’s
              foremost purpose for painting and exhibiting his <hi rend="i">Canterbury
              Pilgrims</hi>,” which according to Read was “to expose the ways he [i.e., Blake, had]
              been personally exploited and abused by Cromek” (182). Read’s demonstration “that the
              idea to paint an illustration of the Canterbury pilgrims and make an engraving of the
              painting originated with Cromek, not Blake” thus arrives at much the same conclusions
              as those of Aileen Ward’s study which was published almost simultaneously (see #167,
              below). The arguments countering Blake’s own charges against Cromek which are supplied
              in both of these essays mutually supplement and corroborate each other; taken together
              I feel they succeed in rewriting a particularly important chapter in Blake’s

“Marxist”
              interpretation of the Industrial Revolution and its effects on eighteenth-century
              culture with little concern for all but the most fundamental dialectics (125-26);
              Marx, I feel, would not have been particularly happy with this simplified account.
              This is followed, in part 2, by an examination of Barry’s “Progress of Human Culture”
              in the context of the American and French Revolutions, the machine breaking at
              Arkwright’s Birkacre mill, and the Gordon Riots (126-28). Southall then interprets
              Wright of Derby’s “series of eight paintings of a cottage on fire” as foreshadowing
              Turner’s “Romantic pessimism” and as iconographically representing “a fearsome
              awareness of the threat posed by ‘progress’ to the very foundations of social order”
              (130). Part 3 examines Blake’s revolutionary imagery, his “promethianism” of the
              1790s, and his “flaming line” (131-35). The author’s sole authority on Blake is
              Michael Davis, and he appears to be unaware of the existence of Bermingham’s and
              Barrell’s studies of the <hi rend="i">Dark Side of the Landscape</hi> in British
              eighteenth- and nineteenth-century art. Because of this lack of familiarity with some
              more recent factual and methodological approaches the article reads as if it had been
              written at least 15 years ago; even then, I am afraid, the author’s endeavors would
              have had to be described as amateurish in the extreme.]</p>

              “De Luca’s first-rate structuralist analysis of the names in Blake’s myth . . . might
              not be the only perspective from which to view Blake’s onomastics, for many of Blake’s
              practices and pronouncements conform quite closely to kabbalistic literary theory as
              well” (345). In order to prove “Blake’s use of Hebraic roots in naming his characters”
              (347), the author has examined dictionaries and studies of the Hebrew language that
              were published in eighteenth-century England. More important, perhaps, than the
              etymological identification of the Hebrew roots for many of the names in Blake’s myth
              which, according to Spector, result from such an investigation into Blake’s possible
              sources, is her suggestion that not only “Blake may have deliberately created the
              name[s] out of Hebrew, but that as he learned more roots, he may have reinterpreted
              the already-formed name” (348). This discussion leads up (and back) to a discourse on
              the “similarities between Kabbalism and modern approaches to Blake” (360), exemplified
              in the work of De Luca, Fogle, Gleckner, and Hilton. See also #155, below.]</p>

              representing “divine love” (112), and Stempel then pursues this further by asking
              whether “the crucial distinction between Divine Reason and Divine Love can be traced
              in the names of the daughters of Ahania and Urizen” (116). Finally Stempel argues that
              Blake’s etymology for Ahania reflects some of the central issues that were brought

              difference” between Blake’s works and the prints which accompany his, and in fact,
              that Thornton “had pinned his enterprise on the success or failure of Blake’s
              innovatory works of printing” (5). After studying the primary sources relating to the

                <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> 22 (1988-1989): 80-92. [The present study is
              the expanded version of a paper which was first read at the Yale Center for British
              Art in Sept. 1982 as the author’s contribution to the symposium on William Blake: His
              Art and Times, organized by the Center on the occasion of its important Blake
              exhibition. Concerned with Cromek’s commission for Stothard to design a painting of
              the <hi rend="i">Canterbury Pilgrims</hi> and Blake’s rival version of the same
              subject, Ward’s revisiting of the Blake-Cromek controversy reestablishes Cromek’s
              reputation: “no hero” (88), yet not the creepy figure known from Blake’s writings and
              those of most of his biographers since Gilchrist. This willingness to accept a
              thoroughly biased and “Blakified” version of what actually happened, based almost
              exclusively on the artist-poet’s “own testimony” as it was “passed on to Gilchrist”
              (80), is here taken to pieces. Ward’s careful examination of the evidence and her
              reconstruction of the chronology of events shows that “there seems no reason . . . to
              doubt Cromek’s word when he congratulated himself ‘for thinking of such a glorious
              Subject’ ” (83). Here, as well as in others of her conclusions, Ward’s seems very
              close to Read’s demystification of the “Cromek affair” (see #143, above, for his
              article on the same subject as Ward’s 1982 paper which, however, was published almost
              simultaneously). Both scholars, however, have evidently arrived at their results quite
              independently and set out from different starting points. This is endorsed, for
              example, by their mutually exclusive readings of the hidden iconography of Blake’s
              print: while Read believes to have detected a crypto-portrait of Cromek in the figure
              of the Miller, Ward feels convinced that “Cromek must have appeared to Blake as ‘the
              Age’s Knave,’ the reincarnation of Chaucer’s Pardoner” (88). The arguments central to
              both essays therefore supplement rather than duplicate each other.]</p>

              [Interesting for challenging “received opinion” about Blake’s early years and his
              artistic training; offers a stimulating account of Blake’s hypothetical reaction
              towards the RA’s schooling while he himself was one of the students. This, according
              to Ward’s convincing argument, had many more facets to it than previously assumed.
              However, and especially in the absence of any new documentary evidence, one will have
              to take some of Ward’s more daring conclusions as, at best, new hypotheses. For
              example, she is certainly correct in pointing out that it is “uncertain” how many
              weeks, months, or even years “Blake decided to remain in the [RA] Schools” (78). She
              then states that “the evidence suggests” that he spent, if not “the regular term
              [which] was for six years,” at least a few years at the Schools. For her “evidence”
              she cites the relatively large number of seven designs exhibited by Blake “between
              1780 and 1785, the span of his six-year term” (78) at the RA’s summer exhibitions, and
              their qualification as “history paintings” (79). And yet, referring to the same source
              used by Ward for her account of the RA Schools, one will immediately be supplied with
              the following caveat: “The term of studentship was . . . six years. . . . These
              figures must be regarded, however, only as years of eligibility. Undoubtedly many of
              the students did not complete their full term but there are no details of attendances
              at this early date nor any record of the termination of studentships”; Sidney C.
              Hutchison, “The Royal Academy Schools, 1768-1830,” <hi rend="i">Walpole Society</hi>
              38 (1960-1962): 130. Aileen Ward may of course have strengthened her argument by
              reference to Raimbach’s testimony; this engraver, from 1799 onwards, “sedulously
              pursued [his] studies at the Royal Academy for about nine years”; <hi rend="i">Memoirs
                and Recollections of the late Abraham Raimbach, Esq., Engraver</hi>, ed. M. T. S.
              Raimbach (London: Shoberl, 1843) 26. So much for the regularity of the six-year term.
              What was the rule and what the exception in the period of attendance at the academy
              schools during the 1780s has yet to be learned. Furthermore, I think it is necessary
              to ask for some hard evidence before accepting such a revision of the history of
              Blake’s early artistic career, since this in turn would necessitate essential changes
              in the previous evaluation of his particular stylistic development and his
              achievements. No such evidence is known to me, and therefore to accept Ward’s
              hypothesis would seem synonymous 
<pb id="p23-143" n="143"/>
with assuming Blake to
              have been an extraordinarily lazy student: it would have taken him years to produce so
              few academic studies that today no more than two of these (disputable) drawings can be
              associated with his attendance of the life class; see Butlin, <hi rend="i">Paintings
                and Drawings of William Blake</hi>, 1981, #71-72. Here as elsewhere one’s
              willingness to accept Ward’s contextual “evidence” will determine the need to rewrite
              earlier accounts of Blake’s life during the 1780s. Such minor criticisms aside, the
              two articles recorded in this and in the preceding entry—both of which seem to contain
              material for the author’s forthcoming biography of Blake—raise high expectations for
              that long-awaited publication. See also #44, above.]</p>

              thirteenth Triennial Conference of the International Association of Professors of
              English, held at the University of York in Aug.-Sept. 1986. The exhibition was
              subsequently shown at Wolfson College, Oxford (15 Sept.-3 Oct. 1986), and included
              prints after Flaxman, Fuseli, Kauffmann, Mortimer, Romney, Alexander Runciman, and

              paper. [This catalogue for an exhibition at the British Museum shown from June to
              Sept. 1989 considers “the British response to the French Revolution in the light of
              the visual culture of the period.” All the objects in the exhibition, mostly dating
              from 1789-1799, were “in one way or another, public works, designed for general
              consumption.” The introduction (see 26-78) and the catalogue entries (see 79-218) are
              concerned with “the question of the persuasive power of images, not only in their own
              time but also in ours.” Bindman tries to explain why and how “a partial vision of
              events has triumphed despite all the attempts of historians to give a more balanced
              view” (9). Barry (#156), Romney (#158, 160), Fuseli (#157, 159), and Blake (#161-64)
              are treated and represented in the chapter on “British Artists and Writers and the
              Revolution” (166-78) and the respective section of the exhibition. There are also
              numerous references to the effects of the Revolution on other members of Blake’s
              cultural environment (such as Bartolozzi, Darwin, Farington, Gillray, Godwin, Hayley,
              Heath, Joseph Johnson, Loutherbourg, Paine, Priestley, Schiavonetti, Sharp, Horne
              Tooke, the Wedgwoods, West, and Wollstonecraft) throughout the book. See also the

              outcome of Blake’s admiration for the second of his high Renaissance heroes has not
              yet been studied with similar exactitude. The present article, while referring to
              Barry and Fuseli only in passing (41-42) and not mentioning Blake’s case at all,
              nevertheless offers a wealth of pertinent information for those who might wish to
              inquire further into his use of pictorial traditions of expression in general, into
              his use of Raphaelesque prototypes for the grammar of the passions in particular, or
              into their relevance for the development of his own personal strategies of

              interest to the creator of Tiriel and Urizen, but it also compares Reynolds’ “Ugolino
              and His Children in Prison” and “Lear in the Storm” with Mortimer’s and Barry’s

                of a 1987 M. A. thesis (U of Karlsruhe, W. Ger.), Bechtold offers an iconographical
                interpretation of Fuseli’s “Nightmare” which is based on Janson’s well-known attempt
                to understand the painter’s invention by reference to Fuseli’s unhappy love for Anna
                Landolt (see 151-52). The author has studied popular ideas about the causes and
                effects of nightmares in both contemporary and classical literature and finds that
                this knowledge corroborates a personalized, “psychological” reading of Fuseli’s
                subject. She does not explain, however, why in 1782 Fuseli’s painting met with what
                she believes to have been a mostly unfavorable public reception (see 150), whereas
                the various prints reproducing the painting seem to have been extremely successful
                on the art market. It may well be that in order to actually grasp the importance of
                Fuseli’s “Nightmare” one will at least have to reverse the sense of direction in
                Bechtold’s analysis of the relation between the artist’s private experience and the
                painting’s function in the public sphere. See also <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated

the
                author’s efforts to delimitate the concept of the grotesque, Fuseli’s “Nightmare” is
                considered a good example (422-23); why that is so was not quite clear to me, though
                I, too, look “with admiration” at the “prophetic expression of a psychic state, a
                complex mixture of fear and lust, the horrible and the beautiful, dream and reality”

                and interpretative contexts in which it can be placed. See also page 175 in Read’s

          </head>
          <p>The following items, quoted from secondary sources in the original checklist entries,
            have since been examined and their publication data verified, so that the asterisks
            which marked them as “not seen” can now be deleted: <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated
              Quarterly</hi> 20 (1986-1987): 76-100, #5, 55 (published London: Tate Gallery
            Publications, 1983; 2nd printing in the new format, 1987; distributed in the US by Salem
            House), 77, 81 (correct date of publication to read 1982), 86, 100, 101, 105, 111, 144,
            162, 173 (originally published in Delhi, India: Ajanta, 1983), 211, 213, 230 (the
            chapter on “Blake” is 35-61), 237, 244, 254, 255, 257, 261, 265 (“Blake: The Exultation
            of Fluidity” is 29-62), 283, 285, 299 (in the title, read <hi rend="i">Revolution
              Controversy</hi>; 21#255 and 22#279 to be corrected accordingly), 305, 310, 312 (the
            subtitle does not appear on the book’s titlepage), 324 (the correct subtitle reads 
              <hi rend="i">Mainly of Writers and Artists</hi>; Grigson’s rather unfriendly recollections
            of Todd appear on 43-46), 329 (the journal title ought to read <hi rend="i">Princeton
              University Library Chronicle</hi>, and the correct page references are 230-55), 340
            (the correct subtitle reads <hi rend="i">Pursuit of the Particular Real</hi>; item
            20#346 to be corrected accordingly), 343, 353, 398(3), 406(1) (the reviewer was A. A.
            Ansari), 421(3) (where, instead of 41, read 41-43), 455(4) (where the volume
            identification has to be specified as 2.1); <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated
              Quarterly</hi> 21 (1987-1988): 52-73, #1, 3, 4, 7, 11 (correct date of publication to
            read 1987), 13 (read <hi rend="i">The English Romantic Poets</hi>; Mary Lynn Johnson’s
            admirably balanced critical report on Blake literature takes up 113-253), 25 (the Blake
            chapter is on 222-57), 35, 38, 47, 61 (the brief notes concerned with Blake are on
            18-21), 93, 118, 149 (see below for added annotation), 154, 158 (correct date of
            publication to read 1983), 159, 165, 181, 187, 191, 192, 193, 197, 209, 215 (correct
            volume reference to read 15.1, page references to read 55-59), 223, 231 (for Yeats and
            Blake, see especially 27-32), 253(4), 268(3), 275(1), 318(2), 329; <hi rend="i">Blake/An
              Illustrated Quarterly</hi> 22 (1988-1989): 36-70, #2, 10 (see revision, below), 42
            (correct <hi rend="i">FMR</hi> volume identification to read 1.3, rather than 3), 99
            (the page references ought to read 49-65), 107 (“Thornton and Blake: Reformist Text and
            Radical Image” is 252-62, and “Samuel Palmer’s Virgil <hi rend="i">con Amore</hi>” is
            284-303), 108, 126 (book’s title to read <hi rend="i">The Romantics</hi>, correct page
            references for Pointon’s article are 77-114), 131 (the book was published in 1986, not
            1987; “William Cowper: Invitations to the Microcosm” is 49-92), 132 (a 2nd printing came
            out in 1988), 136, 157, 163, 170, 171 (“Romantic Theory and English Reading Audiences”
            is 135-71), 174 (the “Introduction” to <hi rend="i">Innocence</hi> etc. discussed on
            44-52), 177, 179 (Blake discussed throughout the book, yet see especially chapter 7,
            “Apotheosis of the Chap-Book,” 208-40), 183, 193 (page references to read 74-77), 212,
            225, 226, 238, 247 (hardbound copies of this hard-boiled story are published by
            Delacorte P), 268(1), 288, 357(1), 363(2) (the correct title of the journal is 
              <hi rend="i">History: Reviews of New Books</hi>), 369(2).</p>
          <p>Two entries have to be deleted altogether, i.e., 20#194 which was replaced by 21#117,
            and 21#251(3), for which see now 22#268(3). In volume 20, the reviewer’s first name in
            #372(1) has to be corrected to read Herrmann instead of the anglicized Herrman, and in
            volume 21 the title in #330 ought to read <hi rend="i">Strangeness and Beauty</hi>(as in
            the main entry, #226) instead of <hi rend="i">Strangers and Beauty.</hi> In the
            checklist for volume 22, the following printing errors call for correction: the correct
            date of publication of #105 is 1986, not 1987; in the title of #165, “Book Illustration”
            has to be spelled in two words, and in the annotation to the same entry read “general
            introduction” for “general instruction”; double quotation marks have to be inserted at
            the beginning of the title of #209, and the single quotation mark preceding the hero’s
            name in the title of #218 has to be deleted.</p>
          <p>I seize upon the opportunity to completely revise at least two of the entries for books
            I had not seen myself when describing them for earlier issues of this report on “Recent
            Publications” in the field of Blake studies:</p>
          <p>21#149. Boime, Albert. <hi rend="i">Art in an Age of Revolution 1750-1800.</hi> A
            Social History of Modern Art 1. Chicago, IL: U of Chicago P, 1987. [Besides sections of
            chapters on “William Blake” (308-49) and on “Blake, Science, and Industry” (349-70),
            this important handbook contains discussions of the art of “Wedgwood” (87-93),
            “Kauffmann” (108-16), “West” (116-37), Darwin, Priestley, and “The Lunar Society”
            (201-13), “Barry” (227-33), “Fuseli” (260-77), on Fuseli’s “Nightmare,” Coutts,
Darwin,
            and Cowper (279-308), and on “Flaxman and Wedgwood” (370-82); Boime therefore offers a
            most useful introduction to an understanding of Blake’s art in context.]</p>
          <p>22#10. Sanesi, Roberto, ed. <hi rend="i">William Blake: Opere.</hi> Trans. Giuseppe
            Conte, Roberto Sanesi, and Dario Villa. Classici della Fenice. Milan, It.: Guanda, 1984.
            Lit 90000. [A bilingual edition of Blake’s “Works”; the scholarly apparatus here offered
            to Italian readers of Blake consists of Sanesi’s “Repertorio” (vii-xlvii), an essay by
            Stefano Zecchi, “Nelle foreste della notte: L’illuminismo millenaristico di William
            Blake” (xlix-lxiv), a few pages of bio- and bibliographical information (lxv-lxxi), and
            textual notes “solo indicative della complessità dei problemi sollevati dai testi”
            (805-32). Whereas Blake’s writings up to c. 1795 are given in their entirety (with the
            exception of parts of the <hi rend="i">Notebook</hi> poems), <hi rend="i">Vala</hi>, the
            marginalia, the letters, and <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> are represented by excerpts
            only. Still, Sanesi’s “Fenice” edition certainly has a chance to function as the Italian
            Keynes or Erdman editions of Blake’s oeuvre, and as such may well cause a further
            increase of critical interest in Blake’s poetry on the peninsula.]</p>
