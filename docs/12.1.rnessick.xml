                <p>The trends I outlined in my last survey of Blake sales (<hi rend="i">Blake
                        Newsletter</hi>, 10 [1976], 53-59) have continued. A new German interest in
                    Blake—note the purchase of the study of <hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi> pl.
                    51 by the Hamburg Kunsthalle—and the improving British economy have added
                    new stimuli to an already active market. The book market, particularly for early
                    facsimiles and volumes with Blake’s engravings, remains on its steep
                    upward course. Two young dealers, Donald Heald of London and Edwin C. Epps, Jr.,
                    of Columbia, South Carolina, have begun businesses with a special emphasis on
                    Blake. Both bring considerable expertise to the field. Three of Blake’s
                    most important series of intaglio illustrations—<hi rend="i">Night
                        Thoughts, The Grave</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Job</hi>—have increased
                    considerably in price, although their continued availability has held off the
                    sharp rise that will undoubtedly occur as soon as these works become truly rare.
                    Once again, no complete illuminated book came on the market, but several
                    individual pages or fragments did appear. The best drawings and prints have
                    fared well, but the market continues shallow and weak for the less impressive
                    drawings. When none of the half-dozen major dealers or collectors compete for a
                    drawing, its sale price (or frequently buy-in by the seller) is about the same
                    as it would have been five years ago.</p>
                <p>The following lists have the same format as the 1974-75 survey, with only minor
                    modifications. All Sotheby, Sotheby Parke-Bernet, and Christie’s auction
                    catalogues have been surveyed, as have the catalogues of the major dealers who
                    regularly handle original Blake materials. I have made no attempt to search out
                    every sale of original works, and thus there are no doubt a good many sales of
                    the more common printed items not included here. A few late 1975 and early 1978
                    sales are also listed.</p>
                <p>I wish to thank Martin Butlin, Detlef W. Dörrbecker, Ruth Fine, and
                    Shaunagh FitzGerald of P. &amp; D. Colnaghi &amp; Co. for their assistance in
                    compiling this list.</p>

                                sides.” Essick Collection. This working sketch is the
                                transition between the earlier and later groups of the six known
                                versions of the composition. The first two pen drawings (British
                                Museum) have the central figure dressed as on the recto of this
                                drawing (Illus. 2). Like this verso sketch, the later pen and wash
                                drawings (Tate Gallery, University of Texas) show him with two
                                garments, a cloak over a gown, rather than the single gown of the
                                earlier versions. The change from the energetic pose of the central
                                figure and the swirling hem of his clothing to a more restrained and
                                rectilinear composition may have been motivated by the same
                                neoclassical norms also influencing Blake’s friends, Stothard
                                and Flaxman, in the early 1780s.</figDesc>

                        copperplate. This was a common practice in the 18th and 19th centuries for

                            <figDesc>“The Gambols of the Ghosts.” Pencil, 46 × 31.5
                                cm. Inscribed “Blake” lower right; “For the
                                Grave” on the verso, not in Blake’s hand. For some years
                                on deposit at the Fitzwilliam Museum by a South African collector
                                under the title “An Allegory of Human Life,” now destined
                                for the Yale Center of British Art. This is apparently the
                                illustration to Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi>, never
                                published, described by Flaxman in his letter to Hayley of 18 Oct.
                                1805 as “The Gambols of Ghosts according with their affections
                                previous to the final Judgment.” Also described by Rossetti in
                                Gilchrist, <hi rend="i">Life of Blake</hi> (1863), II, 242, no. 21.
                                On p. 2 of <hi rend="i">The Grave</hi> (1808 ed.), Blair writes of
                                “light-heel’d ghosts and visionary shades”
                                performing “their mystic rounds” near a yew tree, but does
                                not associate the scene with the Last Judgment. While frenzied
                                spirits circle about the yew in the composition, more pious types
                                parade into the church at the left. A small figure hovering just
                                above the church door holds an object in his upraised right hand
                                (the lash of Conscience?) and a figure with a lash dominates a group
                                cowering on top of the tomb, lower right. Below, graves open as the
                                “ghosts” of the dead are pulled out—or pummeled,
                                lower right—by other embodied spirits.</figDesc>
