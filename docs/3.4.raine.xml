                    <p>I read with great interest the review of <hi rend="u">Blake and Tradition</hi> in your
issue of December 15th by Professor Daniel Hughes. In this review Professor Hughes states that Keynes does not
agree with my interpretation
<pb id="p03-90" n="90"/>
of the Arlington Court Tempera as an illustration of Porphyry’s <hi rend="u">de Antro Nympharum</hi>,
translated by Thomas Taylor. This is not so. Sir Geoffrey Keynes was one of the first Blake scholars to assent
to this view, which he holds to be conclusive. I remember his asserting - as a doctor he was well able to
judge - to my description of the gesture of the kneeling figure as that of “throwing with averted face,”
attributed to Odysseus in this work. He has since confirmed in writing his agreement with my
interpretation.</p>
                    <p>I may add that he caught me out badly on another anatomical error - the sex in the
figure in the lower panel of <hi rend="u">Jerusalem</hi> Plate 33!</p>
