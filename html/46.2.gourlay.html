<div class="text">
<p>Going back more than thirty years, Dennis Read has published articles large and small about the activities of
Blake’s associate Robert Hartley Cromek (1770–1812); in the most important of
these, “The Rival Canterbury Pilgrims of Blake and Cromek: Herculean
Figures in the Carpet” (<em>Modern Philology</em>, 1988), he showed that contrary to the account assembled by 
Gilchrist and echoed by most of Blake’s subsequent biographers, who hold that
Cromek stole the idea from Blake, Blake’s Chaucer picture and engraving were
conceived and created in response to the painting by Thomas Stothard and the
projected engraving after it. Now Read has gathered together much of what else
he has found out about Cromek in a more comprehensive biography that
concentrates on the busy final decade of Cromek’s life, arguing persuasively
that Cromek has been (somewhat) misunderstood.</p>
<p>Born in Yorkshire, Cromek studied at first to be a lawyer, and then at eighteen came
to London to learn engraving from the Italian-born painter/engraver Francesco Bartolozzi. A twelve-page
chapter covers Cromek’s professional career from 1788 to the beginnings of the <em>Grave</em> project in 1805; it focuses mostly
on wheeling and dealing rather than Cromek’s practice as an engraver,
identifying major engraving projects and outlining early disputes with
publishers and collaborators. It ends with a report from one of Cromek’s
friends that although Cromek was “nominally an Engraver; … his tastes and sympathies lay in another direction.” The
artistic and artisanal aspects of Cromek’s early career are treated as
incidental: “Engraving,” writes Read, “… served Cromek mainly as a
way of introducing him to the art world and, more importantly, to the prominent
figures who moved in it” (18).</p>
<p>Cromek certainly did lose interest in actual burin work after about 1805, and Read
shows that he often farmed out portions of his projects to others, but by the
time he retreated from practice as an engraver he had spent almost half his
life working in the trade, much of it in the more artistically ambitious end of
the illustration business, even if he was not a creator of original designs.
This chapter would be stronger if it included a survey and some more
examples of Cromek’s chalcographic output so that we could see his strengths
and weaknesses, judge the trajectory of his career, or consider other ways that
his engraving could shed light on his later projects, and on Blake’s. For
instance, did Cromek try harder than Blake did to conform to publishing
fashions? How do Cromek’s book engravings after Stothard
in the 1790s compare to those that Blake did in the early 1780s? How about
the illustrations to Shakespeare after Fuseli that both Cromek and Blake did
for Chalmers (not “Chambers”) around 1803? Does Cromek’s work as an
engraver of Stothard shed any light on the relationship between publisher,
engraver(s), and artist in the case of Stothard’s Chaucer picture? Shelley M.
Bennett’s <em>Thomas Stothard: The Mechanisms of Art Patronage in England circa 1800</em> (1988) includes very handy (but not
complete) lists by date of Stothard’s works and engravings after him—a
similar appendix of Cromek’s engravings might assist scholars to assess
Cromek’s career for themselves. But the information in this chapter that is most relevant to
comprehending Cromek’s later dealings with Blake is the ample evidence that
long before he and Blake fell out, Cromek often dealt with his business
associates with sharp elbows.</p>
<p>The less perfunctory chapter on the history of Cromek’s illustrated edition of
Robert Blair’s <em>The Grave</em> shows Cromek in a more positive light than Blake’s party has usually been willing to grant
him. Read carefully follows the contemporary records of Cromek’s transactions
and representations as the project evolved, showing that although plans changed
in ways that worked out to Blake’s disadvantage, Cromek’s primary motivation
appears to have been to ensure that his artistically and commercially ambitious
project was a success. Cromek’s elbows were as sharp as ever, and there is
plenty of ungallant trimming in his business arrangements and shameless puffing
in his promotions, but Read convincingly demonstrates that Cromek was never the
villain that Gilchrist and most of his successors have made him out to be. Once
again, Read’s focus as a biographer is on elucidating the tactical calculations
behind Cromek’s commercial and promotional efforts rather than exploring the
artistic thoughts of the various parties to the project. Although the book
reflects the recent rediscovery of Blake’s lost designs for Blair (and an
appendix details the steps in that rediscovery), very little is made of them or
their implications for improved understanding of Cromek or Blake or the
published edition of <em>The Grave</em>. Because Cromek’s most important design contribution to the Blair project may
have been to select the images that were actually engraved and published, the renewed
availability of many of the rejected designs could have afforded insights into
his thinking as an editor and book designer.</p>
<p>The collision between Blake and Cromek over the Blair project reflects a
fundamental difference in the way the two men approached the making of art and
the making of money; the succeeding episode in their relationship, the creation
of competing Chaucer paintings and engravings, appears to have been the result
of mutual recognition of that difference, and here, Read argues, it is Blake’s
biographers who have misunderstood what was going on. Read refines and updates
the arguments in his 1988 article, showing that contemporary first-party
evidence indicates that long before Blake showed any interest in illustrating
Chaucer, Cromek and Stothard had undertaken to create and promote a painting of
Chaucer’s pilgrims that could be the basis of a profitable large-scale
engraving. Like the illustrated edition of <em>The Grave</em>, this was calculated as a middlebrow cultural/commercial project that
would be both lucrative and prestigious for artist, engraver, and entrepreneur.
Stothard executed his part with his usual technical brilliance and shrewdly
sentimental superficiality. His painting was calculated for broad appeal,
offering gently satirical stereotypes, sunny English nostalgia, unchallenging
literary pretentions—who wouldn’t love such a picturesque parade? Certainly
Stothard’s concoction was a cannier offering to the market than the pious
sublimity of Blake’s <em>Grave</em> designs, and Blake seems to have decided that the commercial mechanism embodied in the
picture and Cromek’s campaign to exploit it constituted a challenge to
everything he believed in. When Cromek, mystified by the intensity of Blake’s
detestation, challenged him to create his own version of the subject, Blake
took him up on it, creating a picture with a vast allegorical program and an exhibition,
advertisements, and <em>Descriptive Catalogue</em> to match the promotions of Cromek. Unlike his rivals, Blake delivered his
engraving roughly as scheduled, but was humiliated in the aftermath. Even
though both Cromek and his chosen engraver, Schiavonetti, died before their
project could be completed, the Stothard Chaucer eventually achieved much of
the success that Cromek dreamed for it, becoming Stothard’s most famous work.</p>
<p>Another project of Cromek’s that impinges on Blake’s biography, though indirectly, was
the Chalcographic Society, later the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts
of Engraving. What sounds like a benign professional organization was actually
another, even more ambitious, version of the entrepreneurial approach to art
marketing that drove the Blair and Chaucer projects: Cromek, operating as the
“Secretary to the Chalcographic Society,” attempted to bring together
the foremost patrons of the day with the heavyweights of painting and engraving
to promote subscriptions for a series of twenty huge engravings from new
British paintings—the patrons would confer social prestige, the painters
would offer cultural prestige, and the engravers would enable mass production
of freshly minted elite works of art, generating vast profits that could be
tapped to benefit engravers and engraving, as well as others.</p>
<p>The engraver John Landseer (father of Edwin) responded to the Chalcographic
Society’s promotions by publishing an extravagantly critical <em>Letter to a Member of the Society for
Encouraging the Art of Engraving</em> (July 1810), followed by <em>A Second and a Third Letter …</em>
(apparently published together but dated August and October 1810). These letters take on
the scheme from a variety of angles—economic, political, ethical, practical,
logical, aesthetic; the second two (with addenda) counterattack the
insulting response to the first by Robert Hunt, Blake’s nemesis. It is too bad
that Read was unable to locate these serially paginated pamphlets (which are
bound together in the Rosenwald Collection, now
available digitally as a “page turner” at &lt;﻿<a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/rosenwald.04580" target="_blank">http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/rosenwald.04580</a>﻿&gt;),
and
 had to reconstruct Landseer’s elegantly devastating critiques from the
attempts to refute them by Hunt and Cromek. Blake also responded to the
controversy, probably about the same time, by drafting his famous 
unpublished
“Public Address,” in which he excoriates the Chalcographic Society’s
efforts in terms much less diplomatic than Landseer’s; it seems likely 
to me
that Blake and Landseer were aware of each other’s feelings at some 
point, but
I have yet to see evidence of influence in either direction. By 1811 
Cromek’s
most ambitious attempt to harness Mammon by means of the arts had 
collapsed, partly due to Landseer’s criticisms, but also because of 
problems with its huge scale and other causes, including Cromek’s 
failing health. The subscribers were repaid, and
Mammon, of course, moved on, unperturbed.</p>
<p>The remainder of the book, outlining Cromek’s projects related to Robert Burns,
will be of less interest to Blake scholars, though there is further evidence of
Cromek’s ethical shortcomings, his resourcefulness as a promoter, and his
energy in the last years despite tuberculosis; an appendix on travel by
coach makes clear the hardships involved in his innovations in marketing
the arts to the provinces.</p>
<p>This is a valuable book, and the new information in it is likely to 
lead eventually
to revision of key points of Blake’s biography. But it is also a bit 
slapdash,
as if an old manuscript was hastily updated to reflect recent 
discoveries.
There are dismaying clusters of petty errors. In the first few 
paragraphs of the
second chapter, for instance, Robert is referred to as Thomas (his 
father’s
name), the family is traced to “Kidwick,” rather than (presumably) 
Kildwick in Yorkshire, and the Cromeks are said to move south rather 
than
west from Hull to Manchester. Most of the page citations from Erdman’s <em>Poetry and Prose</em> are from the first
edition rather than the now standard 1982 edition listed in the bibliography,
and are thus wrong by several pages. It is not likely that there will be
another biography of Cromek, so these minor shortcomings are regrettable, but
this book brings us substantially closer to understanding Blake’s contrary
counterpart and the world they shared.</p>
