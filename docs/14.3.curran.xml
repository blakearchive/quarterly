          <p><hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> has in recent years become a staple of
                        college classrooms where Blake is introduced. Its sublimity, its awesome
                        temporal, spatial, and narrative dislocations, the totality of its cosmic
                        vision, all make it a work representative of Blake’s mature prophetic
                        mode but accessible to the novice easily overwhelmed by <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> and
<hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi> As art <hi rend="i">The
                            Book of Urizen</hi> exists on a plane of mastery comparable to its
                        achievement as poem, and again it is an exemplary casebook for exploring the
                        complex relations of text and design in Blake’s work. Up to this
                        point teachers have had to rely on the indifferently reproduced
                        black-and-white redaction of copy G, the Rosenwald copy, edited by Clark
                        Emery for the University of Miami Press, or the reproduction of copy B in
                        Erdman’s <hi rend="i">Illuminated Blake</hi>, generally better in
                        printing but uneconomical for a class not concentrating on Blake. With a
                        strong library, of course, one can coordinate the energies, the clean
                        fingers, and no. 2 pencils of one’s students in a stampede on the
                        rare book room, where the Trianon facsimile of copy G merits an annual
                        dusting. None of these alternatives, however, can vie with a reasonably
                        priced and reasonably presented color reproduction of copy G, for which
                        there is a student, and (not to be discounted) a fair public, demand. To
                        have an edition backed by a major trade publisher heralds wide acceptance,
                        and one might accordingly anticipate wide applause. That is, I think,
                        unlikely. Unfortunately, the defects of this edition, which will undoubtedly
                        dismay purists, are such as to disturb even those who take long views and do
                        not foresee residence in Jerusalem next year or for the determinable future.
                        No aspect of the edition—the reproduction, the edited text, or the
                        commentary—escapes them. Since this review is intended for the
                        journal of record for Blake, I will tax the reader’s patience with a
                        specification of the problems that this edition poses for use in teaching,
                        scholarship, and (lest it be forgotten) one’s aesthetic experience of
                        an undeniable masterpiece.</p>
          <p>The Eassons’ decision to present us with yet another facsimile of copy
                        G is not to be disputed: this latest known complete copy, despite the
                        absence of Urizen’s soliloquy in the problematical plate 4, has come
                        to be thought of as the standard copy, for, unlike earlier copies
                        colorprinted in pastel, here Blake employs a richly layered watercoloring
                        and even the overlay of gold and silver leaf. Copy G is, quite simply, one
                        of the great triumphs of Blake’s art. It does not, however, appear
                        such in this edition. One’s first inclination is to waive minor
                        discrepancies in color, arguing that film technology is still unreliable
                        when it comes to absolute fidelity with four-color plates. This is, of
                        course, the justification for the laborious and expensive
                        collotype-and-stencil process undertaken by the Trianon Press series of
                        facsimiles. In the 
<pb id="p14-139" n="139"/>
Shambala/Random House <hi rend="i">Book
of Urizen</hi>, with color plates printed by Lehigh Press,
                        economy has prevailed over even a minimum standard of fidelity. To begin
                        with, as was noted previously in these pages with the like edition of 
<hi rend="i">Milton</hi> copy B, glossy photographic paper insures a
                        flatness of effect in place of Blake’s subtle texturing. One might
                        imagine the editors protesting but having to acquiesce in such an economy,
                        but as fair trade they should have demanded a true color negative. There is
                        scarcely a plate in which significant departures from the original are not
                        manifest. In general, one may summarize them as a loss of layered texture
                        and a pronounced tendency toward primary hues, Blake’s subtle color,
                        especially in earth tones, being deepened into heavy reds and oranges. Even
                        a cursory glance through the colored plates here will reveal how dominated
                        they are by red. It is not altogether facetious, given this reproduction, to
                        suggest that Fuzon evacuated Egypt to escape the plague of measles ravaging
                        its inhabitants.</p>
          <p>For the purposes of this review, somewhat delayed by the death of Lessing J.
                        Rosenwald, I have compared the Easson reproduction closely with the Trianon
                        facsimile and with the original copy G, recently transferred from the
                        Alverthorpe Gallery to its permanent residence in the Library of Congress.
                        It should be noted from the start that Blake’s familiar siena, the
                        printing base for copy G, is transmuted more or less (the values change from
                        plate to plate) to a strident red.</p>
          <p>1. Title-page. A premonition of what is to follow is figured in the anomalous
                        change of the plate numeral “1” in the upper right from an
                        orangered to bright green. The sky in the upper right is changed from muted
                        blue to azure; indications of pale green vegetation above an otherwise
                        barren tree in the upper left are lost in blotches of orange over olive. A
                        similar swathe of pale green across the bottom is changed to olive.</p>
          <p>2. Preludium. Ugly red stipple disfigures the flesh of woman and child as
                        well as the central background: these are subtle flesh tones in the
                        original. The woman’s outlandish henna hair should be auburn. To her
                        upper right gray-blue sky adopts a greenish tinge toward the top: here all
                        is azure. The flame-like vegetation surrounding the text is a lovely spring
                        green in the original: here, olive-orange, it suggests only fire.</p>
          <p>3. Headpiece of youth racing through flames: in the original pen lines and
                        gold flecking give a textured sense of the body’s immersion in the
                        medium.</p>
          <p>4. Full-page design of crouched Urizen surrounded by rock. The splendid gold
                        flecks in the rock, of obvious iconographical significance, are lost here.
                        Gray-blue in upper left, consistent with rock, here looks like the intrusion
                        of sky. Urizen’s body is simply not rose-purple.</p>
          <p>5. Headpiece of haloed Urizen holding open book. Again, the loss of gold in
                        the halo and in the text of the book removes iconographical significance.
                        The very top should be wholly dark blue, not mostly black. The opaque black
                        blotch across the book is in the original a translucent shadow.</p>
          <p>6. Full-page design of Urizen in semi-cruciform position, immersed in water.
                        This is far from the original with all colors transmuted. Red on face and in
                        hair replaces subtle orange: Urizen’s eyes are not, as here, madly
                        blood-shot. Where there is white, read gray throughout; where electric blue,
                        a faint azure tint. Considerable overpainting with silver leaf (in water to
                        right of Urizen, on his right foot, right knee, and on his beard) and gold
                        (on nose, right big toe, and below him) is lost and with it the
                        three-dimensional sense of immersion.</p>
          <p>7. Three-quarters page design of three falling figures encoiled by serpents.
                        The basic background color of the medium through which they fall should be
                        green, not as here orange. Considerable gold flecking arching over the left
                        figure and accentuating the serpents is absent. The wonderful effect of a
                        scarlet overwash on gold leaf at the bottom is lost. (Incidentally, even the
                        Trianon facsimile erred here by inverting the overlay.) Again, the figures
                        have a blotchy red rather than the grayish flesh tone of the original.</p>
          <p>8. Full-page design of figure balanced on hands surrounded by rock-cloud
                        medium: as a whole much too bright and stark. Where Blake uses a gray or
                        pink-white this has simply white. Red striations are too emphatic. The chief
                        loss is the overwash of lines on the left leg, suggestive of a veil or
                        cloud.</p>
          <p>9. Three-quarters design of agonized Los (?), hands crossed over ears: far
                        too red. Gold flecking above head, to the right of and below the body, is
                        lost.</p>
          <p>10. Two-thirds design of crouched skeleton. Background of text should be
                        light blue, not violet, with azure rather than black above skeletal circle.
                        The basic hue of the skeleton is gold to green, not, as here, orange to red.
                        Flecked gold accentuating cranium and other parts of skeleton is lost.</p>
          <p>11. Full-page design of shackled, weeping old man. The figure sits on golden
                        vegetation, with golden rocks next to his right shoulder, and gold also
                        implicated in the halo-sunburst surrounding his head. That burst is bright
                        red here, but orange to deep red in the original. The face and body have a
                        basic gray cast in the original: here there is much pink and red.</p>
          <p>12. One-third headpiece of figure in rear view supporting rocks. Again as
                        before, the rock should be suffused with gold.</p>
          <p>13. Two-thirds tailpiece with emaciated figure and Los, surrounded and
                        divided by flames. The text has a gray, not violet, wash. The skeletal
                        figure, here an olive brown, has a distinctly green cast with silver flecks
                        on his legs. Los, in contrast, has gold flecks on his legs. There is also
                        gold to far left and in flames above Los; the flames have a lighter rose
                        tint.</p>
          <p>14. Full-page design of crouched nude, arms behind head, has too much red and
                        white. There is gold 
<pb id="p14-140" n="140"/>
leaf throughout the corona
                        surrounding the figure.</p>
          <p>15. Central design of figure holding apart clouds lacks gold in clouds and on
                        rear of head and left shoulder.</p>
          <p>16. Three-quarters design of four heavenly figures looking down to earth. The
                        cloud drapery out of which the two on the right emerge should be a
                        gray-azure, not rich blue. Gold leaf surrounds the descending arm of the one
                        figure. The medium in which his hand trails should be a gray-blue suggestive
                        of water, not green. An anomalous red bull’s-eye intruding just to
                        the left of the plunging beard of the figure to the far right suggests
                        defective film or unprofessional processing: Blake is not responsible for
                        it.</p>
          <p>17. Full-page design of globe emerging from hair of bent figure is perhaps
                        beyond the capacity of a photograph to reproduce. Considerable gold leaf
                        distinguishes the globe.</p>
          <p>18. Three-quarters tailpiece of a cruciform Los in flames, with hammer in
                        left hand and right hand on rock. Gold leaf is missing from the bottom.
                        There is some success in capturing his immersion in flames here.</p>
          <p>19. One-third headpiece of ascending Enitharmon and crouched Los. The text is
                        backed by a much more pronounced gray wash. Background in the design should
                        be gray-black with azure, not turquoise, shading. In the original, gold at
                        Enitharmon’s foot suggests fire, with gray smoke billowing to her
                        left: this simply is lost.</p>
          <p>20. One-third tailpiece of infant falling in fire. A blotchy woodcut quality
                        at the bottom is without basis in the original. The dominant color of the
                        fire is yellow, not as here orange, with streaks of gold.</p>
          <p>21. Full-page design of Los-Enitharmon-Orc. The true cast of these bodies is
                        gray: the whitish-red tones here are still preferable to the inexplicable
                        chocolate to which they are darkened in the Trianon edition.</p>
          <p>22. Two-thirds tailpiece of Urizen exploring his dens. The blue is too
                        strong, and red splashes in the rocks behind Urizen are missing, but this
                        plate is relatively close to the original.</p>
          <p>23. Full-page design of heavily draped, moving figure, viewed from the rear.
                        Heavy red striations on the drapery, overpainted in the original, have a
                        distinct and ugly presence here.</p>
          <p>24. Full-page design of Urizen’s four children, the elements, is a
                        very poor reproduction. Green at the top is transmuted to orange; bluish
                        gray sky to heavy blue; the gray-green vegetation out of which Grodna arises
                        is olive, with his hand surrounded by scarlet, not orange. The muted orange
                        flesh tones in the original are altered to ugly pinks and reds.</p>
          <p>25. One-third headpiece with figures immersed in green medium and entwined
                        with serpent coils. The original gray-green has become forest green, with
                        the purple wash at the bottom a gray-blue.</p>
          <p>26. Full-page design of boy and dog before immense door. The bottom half of
                        this plate looks as if it were splattered with bright red paint: these are
                        subtle accentuations of hue, done with orange, in the original.</p>
          <p>27. Two-thirds tailpiece with Urizen caught in his nets is in general too
                        olive in hue.</p>
          <p>Plate a of copy C—plate 4 of the reading text—is reproduced
                        following plate 27.</p>
          <p>To summarize briefly: one may ignore the aesthetic consequences of the
                        considerable transmutation of color values throughout the plates, but the
                        infidelity has interpretive significance as well. Fully a quarter of the
                        plates have lost detail essential to their meaning (plate 19 being
                        especially obvious), while the marked alteration in hue in several (e.g.
                        plates 2 and 16) obscures their import or subjects them to serious
                        misinterpretation. In effect, this is not a reliable facsimile for scholarly
                        purposes, nor can it be used with confidence in the classroom.</p>
          <p>The twenty-eight color plates are followed by a handsomely printed edition of
                        the text. The “Textual Note” acknowledges that “the nature of
                        the punctuation often shapes the reader’s perception of the meaning
                        of Blake’s words” (41), but that recognition has insufficiently
                        shaped the editors’ attitude toward their task. They appear not to
                        have been guided by the accrued consensus of modern editorial procedure,
                        which emphasizes a selfless modesty as the editor’s abiding virtue.
                        Instead, there is considerable editorial intrusion here, the main feature
                        being a lavish (and at times ungrammatical) sprinkling of commas throughout.
                        These have a palpable rhetorical effect, separating integrated components,
                        slowing the momentum, and often removing a studied ambiguity of modification
                        that is distinctly Blakean. One recognizes that Blake’s
                        idiosyncrasies, like those of Emily Dickinson, pose insoluble problems for a
                        systematic editor. Still, the caveat should be that less is more. Here, the
                        rule is that an editor’s job is to make editorial decisions wherever
                        possible. Many are curious; some are clearly wrong.</p>
          <p>A few examples, compared with the original, will illustrate the effect of
                        such fussing with the text. (I identify line numbers, which are not included
                        in this edition, for convenience.)

In both
                        these cases Blake’s intentions are clear. The misunderstanding of
                        Blake’s point of emphasis for an end-stop in plate 4 forces
                        “Bound” to do service as a passive participle, a wholly
                        unnecessary barbarism. The second case speaks for itself; it is a model of
                        the success often attained by Blake’s peculiar ideas on punctuation.
                        The intruded stoppage obliterates the rapid succession of interdependent
                        actions and the double import of line 12.</p>
          <p>If the Eassons were consistent in regularizing Blake’s punctuation,
                        one might overlook cases where they deliberately remove it. But they retain
                        and dismiss seemingly at will. These two examples, for instance, violate
                        Blake’s apparent intentions, and one is simply puzzled to understand
                        what would motivate or justify such unsupported emendations.

Similarly, the end-stop of
                        15:53-54 is wrongly placed, as the parallel repetition of 18:5 surely
                        indicates. Sometimes, such rhetorical leads are all that Blake offers a
                        reader or editor, and they cannot be disregarded. But sometimes, too,
                        emendation cannot be avoided. Faced with a shambles, does it make sense to
                        create another? I quote the original first, then the Eassons’
                        version: 
						<q> Shudd’ring, the Eternal Prophet smote<lb/>
 With a
                            stroke, from his north to south region<lb/>
 The bellows &amp; hammer
                            are silent now<lb/>
 A nerveless silence, his prophetic voice<lb/>
                            Siez’d; a cold solitude &amp; dark void<lb/>
 The Eternal Prophet
                            &amp; Urizen clos’d<lb/>
<lb/>
 Shudd’ring, the Eternal
                            Prophet smote<lb/>
 With a stroke, from his north to south region.<lb/>
                            The bellows &amp; hammer are silent now,<lb/>
 A nerveless silence, his
                            prophetic voice<lb/>
 Siez’d, a cold solitude &amp; dark
                            void<lb/>
 The Eternal Prophet &amp; Urizen clos’d. (15:35-41)
						</q>
						Adding two periods and reducing a semicolon to the force of a comma do
                        not bring sense to the passage. But if one reads Blake’s punctuation
                        as indicative of stress and also gives due force to line-endings, one might
                        come up with something like the dark, dramatic force that Hazard Adams
                        realizes for his Rinehart reading text: 
						<q> Shudd’ring, the Eternal
                            Prophet smote<lb/>
 With a stroke from his north to south region.<lb/>
                            The bellows &amp; hammer are silent now.<lb/>
 A nerveless silence his
                            prophetic voice<lb/>
 Seized, a cold solitude &amp; dark void.<lb/>
 The
                            Eternal Prophet &amp; Urizen closed. </q></p>
          <p>Finally, I cite a passage whose punctuation makes no sense at all: it could
                        have only one source, the raising in the photographic print of a faint dot,
                        accepted as such by most previous editors, into a full-fledged comma in
                        plate 25, line 12. One supposes, then, that the inadequacies of reproduction
                        have had their unfortunate effect on the text as well. 
						<q> And where-ever he
                            wander’d in sorrows<lb/>
 Upon the aged heavens,<lb/>
 A cold
                            shadow follow’d behind him,<lb/>
 Like a spider’s web,
                            moist, cold, &amp; dim,<lb/>
 Drawing out from his sorrowing soul<lb/>
                            The dungeon-like heaven dividing,<lb/>
 Where ever the footsteps of
                            Urizen<lb/>
 Walk’d over the cities in sorrow. (25:7-14) </q>
If
                        one transposes the comma of line 12 to follow “heaven” rather than
                        “dividing,” the passage makes perfect sense.</p>
          <p>The passages cited here are striking representations of a list that could be
                        extended considerably with more minor examples. One does not wish to be
                        either uncharitable or excessively pedantic, but my own sense is that the
                        list is too long to be dismissed with a shrug. Nor is its presence to be
                        extenuated by arguing that, in critiquing it, the critic wants absolute
                        fidelity in one place and emendation in another. If editors are to command
                        authority, they must proceed from clear principles and with critical
                        perception. These are not the hallmarks of this edition. Neither
                        conservative nor loose in practice, the edition has a tendency to violate
                        common sense and a distinct unwillingness to leave “well enough”
                        alone.</p>
          <p>The commentary exhibits the same penchant on a grand scale, and again one
                        surmises that the purposes for which such a commentary exists have been 
<pb id="p14-142" n="142"/>
inadequately considered. Rather than establish a
                        basic set of premises for reading <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi>,
                        suggesting areas for exploration and leaving the reader to distinguish plain
                        from swamp, the Eassons have attempted an exhaustive reading of the poem in
                        thirty-five pages of print. To many it will perhaps appear as an exhausted
                        misreading, for where the commentary might have been simply provocative of
                        new possibilities for looking at the poem, it becomes rigidly dogmatic,
                        riding its various theses into a lather.</p>
          <p>For all their fulminations against Urizen, “The Adversary,” and
                        their enjoinders to their students to look within, the Eassons seem not to
                        have recognized that it is all perfectly fine to cast him as the barrier to
                        spiritual travel, whatever that is, but that, more to the point and closer
                        to home, Urizen’s spirit dominates this commentary. The primeval
                        Priest is the first to ride a thesis, the creator of formulae that
                        obliterate necessary distinctions in search of inflexible pattern, the
                        regularizer who converts analogy into systematic identity, metaphor into
                        doctrine. This commentary boasts the most thorough analysis yet attempted of
                        the import of embryology for <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen.</hi> As
                        potentially significant as such an investigation might be, it is
                        inappropriate here on two accounts. First, the proper home for such an
                        elaboration is a learned journal: here, though there is considerable
                        assumption of eighteenth-century scientific knowledge, there is not a single
                        reference to substantiate it, and thus one has no solid terms by which to
                        judge the accuracy or sensitivity of the application. Second, there is a
                        crucial misunderstanding of the aims and limits of metaphor, which need have
                        neither the factual truth, the consistency, the elaborateness, nor the
                        scientific credibility of a treatise on gestation. <hi rend="i">The Book of
                            Urizen</hi> is pummeled from all sides to accord with such a model. If
                        contemporary physiology demands, as the editors say, that halfway through
                        the nine-month period of human gestation the sensorium be developed, then
                        halfway through this nine-chapter progression that must be seen to happen.
                        “The brain case is produced in the fifth chapter; the soul appears in
                        the sixth chapter. The soul, having been introduced, is enclosed within the
                        sensorium in the seventh chapter, and the brain begins to function”
                        (76). This seems disarmingly simple—until one looks at the
                        appropriate texts; for this particular brain-case goes by the name of
                        Enitharmon, and her son Orc is, by force of logic, the soul. Having begun
                        the trail of a logical fallacy, the commentary must take it to its end.
                        “When Orc, the soul, is formed, Urizen, hearing the voice of the child,
                        awakens. Apparently, Blake believed the fetus quickened, came to life, began
                        to move, in its seventh month” (79).</p>
          <p>A second metaphorical elaboration, of “The Book of Error” and
                        “The Book of Transformation,” is even more elaborate, and, not
                        having even the textual basis of embryology to go on, is correspondingly
                        more eccentric. Picking up the witty self-referential comments on engraving
                        in <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi>, the Eassons pursue the
                        extent to which <hi rend="i">The Book of Urizen</hi> is a critique of
                        traditional bookmaking. And there is virtually no limit to it, though there
                        is also not a single piece of evidence to support the supposition.
                        Typesetting is seen as almost the ultimate in Urizenic behavior, with no
                        greater sin than that of justifying margins. A quick glance at Calvinist
                        justification is enough to wither Milton by metaphorical transfer, and we
                        turn to the plates for pages of corroboration. <hi rend="i">Post hoc, ergo
                            propter hoc</hi>: the fetal skeleton of plate 10 is the very type of the
                        book; the trees to be found here and there in the plates represent books,
                        inasmuch as trees have leaves; the preponderance of tailpiece designs surely
                        indicates that “the foot of the artist/prophet is bruising the head of
                        the typographer/serpent” (91); and a little in-depth inspection of the
                        falling, serpent-bound trio of plate 7 reveals that the plate is actually
                        about books, the spine of the central figure (who is, let us recall, facing
                        us) coming in the center of the plate and the spectral faces between the
                        figures being here called flayed skins, which are the materials for
                        book-binding, the entire plate representing “Blake’s visionary
                        joke” (99) about royal folios.</p>
          <p>I don’t get it. The real joke is that such an extensive travesty of
                        the rules of evidence and of logical development should be serious and that
                        it should be accepted without question by a reader—or a
                        press—on the grounds of “mad Blake.” Students, with an
                        unerring instinct for the outrageous and obscure, will be quoting this stuff
                        to their teachers for decades, especially since much of the tone of the
                        commentary is ostentatiously pitched down to a freshman level. Urizen
                        “is incapable of meaningful communication . . . meaningful
                        conversation” (69), just like Charley down the hall in the dormitory;
                        but if Charley responds best to Daffy Duck, remember that “<hi rend="i">The Book of
Urizen</hi> has . . . a seeming comic book clarity.
                        However, while <hi rend="i">Urizen</hi> is comic, Blake intentionally
                        compounds its comic clarity with prophetic obscurity” (88).</p>
          <p>The Eassons, who are experienced journal editors, have ventured into editing
                        Blake for the first time, and unquestionably they and their projects would
                        have profited from experienced editorial oversight. Half of the commentary
                        should have been suppressed, and a rigorous scrutiny—not that of
                        Urizen, but of Los—applied to the whole. You do not advance
                        scholarship or knowledge by indulging in high-school cant or culture, nor by
                        placing the claims of perverse ingenuity above the formal demands of logic,
                        nor by speculating wildly without a shred of support under the pretense of
                        editorial authority. You do by such indulgences set a decidedly negative
                        example for students, one that I would predict most educators would prefer
                        not to have to counter.</p>
          <p>It would have been good for the Eassons to have pondered the local
                        application of the sentence with which they begin their long exposition of
                        “The Book of Error”: “According to Blake, the medium of the
                        book is predisposed to generate error, though it is not necessary that the
                        medium of the book cause error” (81). The fact of the matter is that
                        this edition generates and dispenses a remarkable amount of error in each of
                        its three divisions. It was not necessary that it do so, nor that any
                        successors, if there are to be such in this series, should do so. There is
                        commendable ambition in this series: the 
<pb id="p14-143" n="143"/>
                        opportunity to do lasting service to Blake studies is manifest. But there is
                        a commensurate responsibility on the part of the editors, a responsibility
                        to which in this volume they appear wholly unconscious. Reviewers, who in
                        their professional existence prefer the dulcet tones of Palamabron to the
                        hard judgments of Rintrah, nonetheless must assume their
                        responsibility—with the hope that both editors and reviewers, the
                        next time around, will discover the States that please both them and the
                        Blake community.</p>
