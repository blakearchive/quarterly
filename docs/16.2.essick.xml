        <p>Since the last survey of sales (<hi rend="i">Blake</hi> 14, [summer 1980] 4-21), the market
     for books by and about Blake has continued its steady upward course, in some cases beating the
     general inflation rate by a fair margin. Libraries and individuals building a Blake collection
     will have to pay more than ever, but at least the major scholarly works continue to be
     available. Early facsimiles have increased more than other genres of Blakeana, and the
     publications of the Blake Trust have held their value in spite of wide availability. The
     spectacular increases registered by a few books with engravings by Blake, such as Stuart &amp;
     Revett’s <hi rend="i">Antiquities of Athens</hi> and Hunter’s <hi rend="i">Historical Journal</hi>,
have little to do with Blake’s contributions. Travel books of
     all sorts, classical antiquities, and natural history books have shot well ahead of the general
     Blake market. The exception is of course original copies of the illuminated books. Certainly
     the most notable sales of 1980-1981, from both a financial and scholarly perspective, were in
     this area. Two copies of <hi rend="i">Song of Innocence and of Experience</hi> reappeared on
     the market, one printed by Blake and lost from sight since 1830, the other a posthumous copy
     not recorded since 1920. The former is an exceedingly important discovery, for it is the only
     copy printed by Blake containing all the poems he is known to have etched for the 
<hi rend="i">Songs.</hi> Both copies have been described in the summer 1981 issue of this journal.</p>
        <p>It is always difficult to assess the market values of Blake’s original graphics
     because of the rarity of his best separate plates. “Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims”
     used to make frequent appearances on the auction block, but I have found none since the second
     state impression sold in February 1979 and recorded in the last survey of sales. The only
     important separate plate sold in the last two years is an impression of “The Man Sweeping
     the Interpreter’s Parlour” (illus. 5) which, because of its weak inking and/or
     printing, fetched £1200 less than a fine impression (now at the Yale Center for British
     Art) sold at auction in July 1979. The Job series, that masterpiece so readily available every
     season, set what are probably new records at auction (£6300) and in a dealer’s
     catalogue ($15,000).</p>
        <p>Only two important drawings or paintings changed hands in 1980-1981. <hi rend="i">St. Paul
      Shaking Off the Viper</hi> merely passed from one dealer to another; but <hi rend="i">Every
      Man Gave Him a Piece of Money</hi>, a lovely small drawing with a checkered history in recent
     years, has found a permanent home at the Tate Gallery. The market for Blake’s lesser
     drawings has been in the doldrums for at least ten years, and the auctioning of three early
     works (illus. 1-4) in November 1980 offered little hope for movement. But one year later, two
     drawings did very well in a London sale room. <hi rend="i">Saul and David</hi>, an early
     drawing not of overwhelming beauty, is exactly the sort that has attracted few bidders in
     recent years and frequently resulted in a buy-in for the vendor (no sale). Yet, at £1100
     hammer price (the bid for which it was “knocked down” at auction), it fetched a sum
     at the upper end of the house estimate (£800-1200). The second work in the same
     Christie’s sale, <hi rend="i">A Male Nude with an Urn</hi>, looked like an even better
     candidate for failure. I doubt that it would even be attributed to Blake if it were not for the
     rather convincing signature. At £800 hammer price, this pen &amp; ink sketch far
     outdistanced the estimate of £300-400. If this sale represents a trend, what could have
     caused a reversal of a decade-long pattern?</p>
        <pb id="p16-87" n="87"/>
        <p>One answer might be the appearance of Martin Butlin’s monumental catalogue of
     Blake’s paintings and drawings. Such a book gives to its subject a position in the art
     world he would not otherwise command, the imprimatur of professional acceptance within the
     canon of artists deemed worthy of a catalogue raisonné. I need not comment at length on
     the circularity of such bestowals of value or the irony of giving Blake importance by finding
     his pigeonhole in the pantheon. More practically, the inclusion of a sketch like <hi rend="i">A
      Male Nude</hi> in Butlin’s catalogue endows it with an authenticity no auction blurb
     could summon. One successful sale of lesser material does not mean, however, that
     Blake’s work has entered the big-money art market. The next important Blake
     picture—for example, a biblical water color or 1795 color printed drawing in good
     condition—to be offered at auction will be a better harbinger of a change in taste. The
     public knows Blake, or at least knows ‘‘The Ancient of Days,’’ and
     book collectors have increased the market value of his illuminated books well beyond his
     drawings and paintings. Art professionals and major art collectors have yet to follow suit, at
     least with their checkbooks.</p>
        <p>The following record of Blake sales for 1980-1981 is in the same format as the last two
     lists, with but three exceptions. The section on Blake’s Circle and Followers has been
     expanded to include British artists of the generation before Blake’s (James Barry, John
     Hamilton Mortimer, and Alexander Runciman) who may have influenced him or at least worked in
     similar genres and styles. The coverage of Thomas Stothard has been extended to his engraved
     book illustrations. As in the past, oil portraits by Romney and Richmond are excluded. The
     amount of information on secondary materials has been much abbreviated—see the headnote
     to the final section.</p>

          <p>Both Sotheby’s and Christie’s have begun to add their 10% surcharge to the
      hammer price in their price lists. These net amounts have been given here, following the
      official price lists in all cases.</p>
          <p>I wish to thank those friends, particularly Martin Butlin, Edwin Epps and Ruth Fine, who

          <p>The following section records low and high prices, with more details given for a few special
      items. As a rule of thumb, one can assume that the low price represents an average copy, or
      even one with a worn exterior but sound interior, sold at auction; the high is generally an
      “as new” copy offered in a bookseller’s catalogue. Yet these factors account
      for the wide ranges of prices less than the eternal vagaries of the marketplace. Internally
      damaged or incomplete copies (and, at the other end of the spectrum, copies in elegant
      bindings worth more than their contents) have been excluded. “Special ed.” in
      reference to Blake Trust facsimiles refers to copies with additional materials added by the
      publisher, usually templates and progress proofs. Prices in pounds sterling have been
      converted to dollars at the rate of £1=$2. Volumes still in print are not included.</p>
