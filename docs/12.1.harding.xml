						<q> Deeper into September<lb/>
 the rose-hips are little spots of
                            hares’ blood.<lb/>
 In the perpetual cardgame<lb/>
 between the
                            rowan and the bramble<lb/>
 the ace of spades has come up<lb/>
 in the
                            shape of a rook<lb/>
 with folded wings.<lb/>

 Deep in there<lb/>
 in
                            the wet grass<lb/>
 he was born, in 1757,<lb/>
 was born directly from the
                            wet grass.<lb/>
 They threw him in the river.<lb/>
 He rode on the
                            waves.<lb/>
 They threw him in the fire.<lb/>
 He rose from it<lb/>
 with
                            eyes of fire.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
 He is William Blake<lb/>
 with a blue hat and
                            pink cheeks.<lb/>
 Alive, he wandered<lb/>
 on the grass of death.<lb/>
                            Dead, he wanders<lb/>
 in a humming cloud of bees<lb/>

						<q> Even as a child he drew people<lb/>
 the way they look, as houses<lb/>
                            with long legs<lb/>
 beginning under the chin. They<lb/>
 grew out of the
                            ground<lb/>
 like grandfather clocks from the floor<lb/>
 like tables and
                            chairs from the parquet. Houses<lb/>
 are built from within, built<lb/>
                            from below, by hands<lb/>
 reaching up from the soil. They grow<lb/>
 out
                            of dark basements.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
 And this house around you<lb/>
 is hell, and
                            this house around you<lb/>
 is the law, is the power over you. In
                            there<lb/>
 they buy you and sell you. <pb id="p12-40" n="40"/>
The lines
                            in his brow know<lb/>
 that the time of the Tiger must come<lb/>
 before
                            the time of the Lamb,<lb/>
 that there are words other than those<lb/>
                            that fill the mines with children<lb/>
 and the colonies with
                            soldiers<lb/>
 in red coats. The engraver’s burin<lb/>
 cuts lines
                            in the metal. The contours of the world<lb/>
 are etched in the acid
                            bath, his veins<lb/>
 in the boards of the walls.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
 Walls around
                            us. Walls<lb/>
 within us. Shut in<lb/>
 we speak to a wall<lb/>
 we speak
                            to a wall<lb/>
 within ourselves.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
 2.<lb/>
 William
                            Blake’s wife lifts the clothes-iron<lb/>
 from the stove, carries
                            it to the table. Heavily<lb/>
 it slides over the damp shirt<lb/>
 over
                            warm white cloth. His thoughts<lb/>
 are so heavy. They have stuck in the
                            clothes<lb/>
 that are so full of thoughts<lb/>
 that they will never be
                            really clean again.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
 She comes to him<lb/>
 lies down beside him
                            on the bed.<lb/>
 Their shoes meet under the bed<lb/>
 in front of the
                            china pot<lb/>
 with the green garland of flowers. His sex<lb/>
 presses
                            in between her thighs<lb/>
 among soft curly hairs, presses<lb/>
 into the
                            moist cleft<lb/>
 where the Universe is created, slippery wet walls<lb/>
                            becoming tense and then lax. The Universe pulsates<lb/>
 with their
                            movements<lb/>
 from star to star<lb/>
 from darkness to
                            darkness.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
 Freedom comes flowing in<lb/>
 through their
                            nostrils, opens<lb/>
 doors and shutters, draws the wind<lb/>
 through the
                            chimney<lb/>
 kindling the fire. A gust of wind<lb/>
 goes through the
                            houses, shakes them<lb/>
 so that the pans fall down<lb/>
 from their
                            racks.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
 Only their heavy breathing<lb/>
 separates them from the
                            darkness<lb/>
 until it too begins to breathe violently<lb/>
 dies and is
                            born again, is filled with light<lb/>
 growing up around them. Another
                            house<lb/>
 where the sky comes flowing blue through the windows<lb/>
                            where the clouds glide through the rooms, the floor<lb/>
 greens and is
                            covered with flowers<lb/>
 when his semen falls on it.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
 Quivers
                            and creaking<lb/>
 from the bed, soft liquid<lb/>
 running between their
                            thighs. For a second<lb/>
 it was they who made the Universe grow,<lb/>
                            who made men rise and continue their journey,<lb/>
 roots of trees<lb/>
                            press deeper into the earth<lb/>
 for water.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
 3.<lb/>
 The same
                            grey-headed God<lb/>
 his muscular body covered with silvery down.<lb/>
                            The same white Goddess<lb/>
 made pregnant by a flow of stars.<lb/>
 The
                            same rain<lb/>
 between the furrows. The oxdriver’s cry<lb/>
                            forces the plough through the soil<lb/>
 with the power of brown
                            muscles.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
 The same sun<lb/>
 chained among the boughs of the
                            trees.<lb/>
 The same face<lb/>
 nailed to the trunk of a tree. The same
                            blood<lb/>
 on the wet clay<lb/>
 making everything move forward<lb/>
                            making the new Albion rise<lb/>
 from the sea of Time.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
 4.<lb/>
                            With the shutters wide open<lb/>
 their house is filled with light.<lb/>
                            Their brains are burning<lb/>
 like overheated lamps, burning<lb/>
 the
                            air in the room, lighting up<lb/>
 the whole city. Giant cats<lb/>
 come
                            out of the alleys<lb/>
 showing the tattered men<lb/>
 the way
                            home.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
 It is the beginning of the time of the Tiger.<lb/>
 The
                            cries<lb/>
 of the masses flow in through the windows.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
 When the
                            walls are falling within you<lb/>
 the walls of the Bastille will fall.
                            When<lb/>
 the walls fall within us<lb/>
 we become a single living
                            force<lb/>
 that rifle bullets cannot harm<lb/>
 not a river but a
                            sea<lb/>
 like time, not a river<lb/>
 but a sea.<lb/>
                            <lb/>
 Tomorrow or a
                            thousand years from now<lb/>
 we will open the roof hatch<lb/>
 and
                            arise<lb/>
 our faces turned toward the sun, arise<lb/>
 from our
                            houses<lb/>
 as from murky wooden coffins. Tomorrow<lb/>
 or a thousand
                            years from now<lb/>
 we will live the lives<lb/>
 we were meant to live.
                            William Blake<lb/>
 blows out the candle. Tomorrow<lb/>
 we will color the
                            pictures,<lb/>
 he says. </q>
