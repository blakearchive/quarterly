                    <p>Subscription prices for <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> have been raised
                        considerably, as you will have no doubt noticed. The following explanation
                        and apology was mailed with this year’s bills:</p>
                    <p>Dear Subscriber</p>
                    <p>With your annual bill for another year’s subscription to <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, we
would like to offer an apology for contributing to the
                        increases in your cost of living.</p>
                    <p>You will notice that the price of a subscription has increased to $10 for
                        individuals, $12 for institutions. We <hi rend="i">hope</hi> you havealso
                        noticed that the number of pages in an average issue of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> has
increased proportionately during the past year. Our
                        issues have been running about 80 pages. When we were the <hi rend="i">Blake
                            Newsletter</hi> issues averaged 24-44 pages. We hope you have also
                        noticed that <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> gets a <hi rend="i">lot</hi> of text on
                        a single page, much more than the average 6 × 9 scholarly journal
                        that prints 1 column per page. And finally, we don’t think you could
                        have missed the illustrations, which are very expensive to print, but which
                        we think make <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> especially useful to you as a
                        scholar.</p>
                    <p>We would also like to assure you that we take every economy to keep the cost
                        of our issues as low as possible. <hi rend="i">All</hi> the layout and
                        pasteup of our journal is done by unpaid volunteer editorial assistants, for
                        example. That is extremely unusual for a scholarly journal, if not unique.
                        If that work were turned over to professionals, the cost of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>
would soar.</p>
                    <p>And, despite the economies, despite the increase in your subscription price,
                        the cost of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> is still heavily subsidized by the
                        University of New Mexico. The subsidy has, in fact, just been increased.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we hope that you will take a moment to consider that the fat issues
                        of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> are costing you only about $2.50 each—even
                        at the $10 per year price.</p>
                    <p>Thank you in advance for your patience. Yours truly, The Editors.</p>
