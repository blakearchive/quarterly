          <p>A recurring fascination in the reading of Blake is to wonder how some of his
                        statements and exhortations would feel if lived out in a real
                        life—one’s own, for example. Many of the novelists who have
                        used Blake have explored this question, from a variety of perspectives.
                        Joyce Cary in <hi rend="i">The Horse’s Mouth</hi> gave us one version
                        of the artist as hero, living out his own interpretation of Blake. Colin
                        Wilson’s <hi rend="i">The Glass Cage</hi> made its hero a Blake
                        critic, but an oddly reclusive one, who appears a little ambivalent in his
                        lived responses to the poet, and is now writing about Whitehead.</p>
          <p>Both these novels are well known, but readers of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> may
                        not know the next two novels, which sparked this note. The first is R. F.
                        Nelson’s <hi rend="i">Blake’s Progress</hi> (Toronto: Laser
                        Books, 1975), which starts as a rather engaging biography of Blake,
                        beginning with his marriage. It reveals that Kate remained a virgin for many
                        years, was responsible for most of Blake’s successful commercial
                        engravings, and was generally invaluable. It also tells us that
                        Blake’s poetry is not really poetic fiction at all, but that the
                        prophecies are full of names and images “taken from William’s
                        adventures as a time-voyageur through the alternate worlds, used to comment
                        on the current political and social scene” (pp. 108-09). The book is
                        fun, up to a point, but very literal at heart; Blake becomes a hero, but at
                        the expense of his poetry, which becomes simply a fancy kind of space travel
                        reporting.</p>
          <p>The second book is very different. It is by a writer often labeled as a
                        writer of science fiction, but in this case he bypasses science and
                        technology completely. J. G. Ballard’s <hi rend="i">The Unlimited
                            Dream Company</hi> (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1979) is a
                        tale about a young man called, simply, Blake. He is a not very successful
                        creature of the twentieth century, and no explicit attempt is made to relate
                        him to our William, except the name—and the story. One might begin a
                        description by suggesting that it explores what it would be like to
                        experience some of Blake’s central metaphors, or that it is a kind of
                        narrative version of “Auguries of Innocence” and “To my
                        Friend Butts I write.” In its progress, it almost convinces the reader
                        that “vices in this world may well be metaphors for virtues in the
                        next,” offers vivid intuitions of what the vortices described in Plate
                        15 of <hi rend="i">Milton</hi> might feel like, and puts into narrative play
                        Blake’s musings about identity and identification. By omitting all
                        reference to Blake’s life and writings, Ballard has written a <hi rend="i">tour de
force</hi> that in some ways gets closer to the heart
                        of Blake’s vision than the more explicitly Blakean novels. [<hi rend="i">My thanks
to Roberto Cucci and Barbara Heppner for drawing my
                            attention to the last two novels.</hi>]</p>
