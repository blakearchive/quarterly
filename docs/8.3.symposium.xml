          <p>The Blake symposium held at the University of Edinburgh 1-4 May 1974 was attended by about 25
people, who kept discussion going variously during the intervals of eating and sight-seeing.<supplied

	<note id="n0"><hi rend="i">(Our thanks to David V. Erdman for this item. Eds.)</hi></note> The sights were in
the University of Glasgow Library (an exhibition of emblem books and of the work of a 19th-century Scottish
follower of Blake, David Scott) and at Pollock House, Glasgow, an Adams mansion now a museum of the fine arts
housing six Blake originals, including the painting of <hi rend="i">The Canterbury Pilgrims</hi> and portraits
of <hi rend="i">Adam</hi> and of <hi rend="i">Eve</hi> (the latter partly repainted).</p>
          <p>The sensation of the conference was a dramatic performance, “Conversations at Mr. Quid’s”
(based on <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi> and, as an imaginative interlude, <hi rend="i">The Book of
Thel</hi>), directed by Dr. Roger Savage—a smashing hit, all agreed. A public lecture by E. P. Thompson, who
also participated in the seminar, presented some of the evidence of Blake’s doctrinal affinities with such
fellow antinomians as the Muggletonians and the radical Swedenborgians.</p>
          <p>There were seven seminar papers, each followed by extensive discussion, most of them illustrated
by slides. They were:
<q>
Heather Glen, “Blake’s Criticism of Moral Thinking in the <hi rend="i">Songs”</hi><lb/>
Frank M. Parisi, <hi rend="i">“The Gates of Paradise</hi> and Emblems of Melancholy”<lb/>
Belinda Humfrey and David Worrall, “Who Shall Bind the Infinite: A Study of <hi rend="i">Europe”</hi><lb/>
David V. Erdman, <hi rend="i">“Milton</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Song of Los:</hi> Text and Illuminations”<lb/>
James B. Ferguson, “Prefaces to <hi rend="i">Jerusalem”</hi><lb/>
John Beer, “Blake and the Problems of Influence”<lb/>
Annette S. Levitt, “Comus, Cloud, and Thel’s ‘Unacted Desires’ ”
