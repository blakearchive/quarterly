	<meta name="DC.Description" xml:lang="en" content="  Over the last two decades, scholars and collectors have been blessed with a remarkable series of discoveries of unrecorded or long-lost works by Blake. If this record has led us to expect new treasures almost every year, 2011 did not disappoint. By early February I learned that Bonhams in London would offer an unrecorded copy of Blake&amp;rsquo;s  Poetical Sketches  (1783) in its 22 March auction. This adds one more copy to the twenty-three previously traced and is only the third remaining in private hands.  A person representing a descendant of Charles Augustus Tulk (1786-1849), the Swedenborgian friend of Blake and John Flaxman, contacted me in March about an album of drawings owned, and probably assembled, by Tulk&amp;rsquo;s daughter Louisa Susanna in the first half of the nineteenth century. Several British Blake scholars inspected the album and found in it a watercolor and a pencil drawing definitely attributable to Blake and a pen and ink drawing probably from his hand. The watercolor and pencil drawing bear sketches by Blake on their versos. The collection also includes several drawings by Flaxman. On the basis of digital images supplied by the Tulk family&amp;rsquo;s representative, I&amp;rsquo;m confident that these attributions are correct. None of these materials has been previously recorded. The disposition of this important discovery is still pending as of January 2012. ">

By early February I learned that Bonhams in London would offer an unrecorded copy of Blake’s <em>Poetical Sketches</em> (1783) in its 22 March auction. This adds one more copy to the twenty-three previously traced and is only the third remaining in private hands.&nbsp;<a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fn3" name="fr3" id="fr3">[3]</a> John Windle, bidding on my behalf, was successful at a hammer price of £60,000 (£72,000 including the buyer’s premium).

      <td class="body">A person representing a descendant of Charles Augustus Tulk (1786-1849), the Swedenborgian friend of Blake and John Flaxman, contacted me in March about an album of drawings owned, and probably assembled, by Tulk’s daughter Louisa Susanna in the first half of the nineteenth century. Several British Blake scholars inspected the album and found in it a watercolor and a pencil drawing definitely attributable to Blake and a pen and ink drawing probably from his hand. The watercolor and pencil drawing bear sketches by Blake on their versos. The collection also includes several drawings by Flaxman. On the basis of digital images supplied by the Tulk family’s representative, I’m confident that these attributions are correct. None of these materials has been previously recorded. The disposition of this important discovery is still pending as of January 2012.</td>

In March I found on its web site, &lt;﻿<a href="http://www.grosvenorprints.com/" target="_blank">http://www.grosvenorprints.com</a>﻿&gt;, what is probably the earliest reproduction, previously unrecorded, of Louis Schiavonetti’s engraving of Blake’s “Death’s Door” design for Blair’s <em>The Grave</em> (see <a href="http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/public/journals/2/BonusFeatures/Spring2012/Essick/Door.html" target="_blank">illus. 7</a>). While perusing the site in late April, I came upon a proof before letters of a portrait engraving of George Romney.

      <td class="body">The auction season began auspiciously with the sale of works of art and furnishings from the collection of the late Charles Ryskamp at Sotheby’s New York on 25 January, “for the Primary Benefit of Princeton University” (auction catalogue). Two leaves of drawings by Blake in the collection were included. Interest in <em>A Woman Enthroned</em> rests principally on an attempt to determine its subject and the way it serves as a test for telling the difference between a very early work by William Blake and one by his brother Robert. The pencil drawing <em>The Lion Lying Down with the Ox</em> (catalogued as a verso in Butlin) is more impressive. The sketches on the other side (the recto in Butlin) include preliminary details for motifs appearing in <em>America a Prophecy</em> of 1793. These not only help in dating both recto and verso but also offer evidence about how Blake developed images for his illuminated books.

Coverage of regional auctions is selective. Dates for dealers’ online catalogues are the dates accessed, not the dates of publication. Works offered online by dealers and previously listed in either of the last two sales reviews are not repeated here. Most of the auction houses add their purchaser’s surcharge to the hammer price in their price lists. These net amounts are given here, following the official price lists. The value-added tax levied against the buyer’s surcharge in Britain is not included. Late 2011 sales will be covered in the 2012 review. I am grateful for help in compiling this review to Elizabeth Barker, G. E. Bentley, Jr., Mark Crosby (particularly for assistance with women holding shields), Harriet Drummond, Allison Galea, Ted Hofmann, Tim Linnell, Nicholas Lott, Constance McPhee, Luana J. Nandan, Morton Paley, Steven Vest, Joseph Viscomi, Angus Whitehead, and John Windle. My special thanks go to Alexander Gourlay for help with <em>Poetical Sketches</em> and Landseer prints, as well as his usual generosity in keeping me abreast of eBay auctions.

Laid paper without watermark, chain lines 2.8 cm. apart, all leaves between 0.11 and 0.12 mm. thick.&nbsp;<a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fn6" name="fr6" id="fr6">[6]</a> Some leaves appear to be uncut along their fore-edges, with evidence of deckle along the fore-edges of the 1st and 2nd leaves of some gatherings, although <em>BB</em> 345 records a larger leaf size of 22.3 x 13.9 cm.&nbsp;<a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fn7" name="fr7" id="fr7">[7]</a> Leaf B4 pasted to a stub, G1 and I4 each with a round hole, 3.0 mm. and 4.0 mm. in diameter, touching letters (described in the auction cat. as “paperflaw[s]” rather than later damage). Upper corner of the fore-edge of B1 and lower corner of the fore-edge of F1 torn off, the latter possibly during printing because of a paper flaw, neither affecting text. Some scattered foxing and spotting, particularly on the 1st 2 leaves. Dust and damp staining on the title page (leaf [A1r]) suggest that it was exposed without a cover for some years. Perhaps the final leaf, blank K4, was similarly soiled on its verso; this may have been a reason for its removal. Bound, probably in the 1st 3 decades of the 20th century, in dark-blue crushed morocco, blue cloth place-mark ribbon, marbled endpapers, 2 added flyleaves of off-white machine-made paper at the front and 2 at the back, gilt-stamped ruled frame lines front, back, and spine, the spine gilt stamped “POETICAL / SKETCHES / W. B. / 1783,” the inside front cover gilt stamped lower right “BOUND BY WOOD, LONDON.”<br>
          The stub for leaf B4, 1.0 mm. (head) to 5.0 mm. (tail) wide, was made from the inner margin of the conjugate leaf, B1. This procedure explains why B1 is narrower at the tail than at the head, which corresponds inversely to the stub, wider at the tail than the head. B4 is not a <em>cancellans</em> or facsimile; it may have required pasting to a stub because it became detached when a prior binding was removed and the spine slightly shaved for rebinding.<br>
          <em>BB</em> 345 notes the presence of “facsimile pages,” some showing a “MICHALLET” watermark, in 5 copies of <em>Poetical Sketches</em>, including whole gatherings H, I, and K (there is no J) in copies K, L, and U, gatherings I and K in copy P, and the “Advertisement” (leaf [A2]) in copy Q. <em>BBS</em> 107 states that the “Advertisement” in copy P is also “in facsimile.” <em>BB</em> points out that “the clearest indication of the facsimile [gatherings] is in the last words on p. 59, where the penultimate ‘Prepare’ is under the ‘w’ of ‘welcome’ in genuine copies and under the ‘c’ in the facsimile” (345n1). The absence of the facsimile watermark and the position of “Prepare” in this copy indicate that all gatherings are genuine. Bentley describes other features distinguishing original leaves from facsimiles in <em>Blake</em> 45.1 (summer 2011): 10. All leaves in this copy meet these criteria for an original, including the presence of the catchword (“THE”) on p. 59, the correct spelling of “honest-seeming” on p. 65, and the absence of any significant differences in paper thickness or the boldness of chain lines among leaves.<br>
          Three leaves (I2, I4, K3) show 3 stabholes just outside the gutter from a prior, pamphlet-style binding. These are 7.0 cm. from the top margin and 4.4 cm. and 3.0 cm. apart. Leaves D3 and E2 show only the top and bottom holes; C1-2, D2, D4, and F2 show only the top hole; H1 shows only the bottom hole. It is unusual for an octavo in half sheets to have been bound in this fashion, since the gatherings can be sewn through their inner folds. Blake’s wife, Catherine, apparently bound her husband’s illuminated books pamphlet-style, stabbed through the leaves within the left margin rather than sewn through the folds.&nbsp;<a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fn8" name="fr8" id="fr8">[8]</a> Thus, the stabholes may be remnants of the book’s original binding produced by Catherine. The absence of any evidence of this stabbing on most leaves is probably due to the rebinding of the holes into the book’s gutter. The present binding may have been produced by Harry Wood, active in London in the 1890s, or (more probably) by the successor firm continued by Henry Thomas Wood that operated under the name H. T. Wood from 1900 to the early 1930s. See Maurice Packer, <em>Bookbinders of Victorian London</em> (London: British Library, 1991) 166, and Mirjam M. Foot, <em>Studies in the History of Bookbinding</em> (Aldershot: Scolar P, 1993) 74.<br>

Linnell May 1892 / to be returned” (£650 each). According to Nicholas Lott of Larkhall, these impressions are “well printed and show some considerable detail compared to many rather heavy over-inked Linnell printings.” John Linnell, Sr., acquired the blocks in 1825. According to John Linnell, Jr., some impressions were printed for his father by Edward Calvert (I suspect shortly after acquiring the blocks) and “J. L. jun. &amp; brother printed a few of the blocks, but did not finish the set” (<em>BB</em> 630, quoting from a manuscript “List of John Linnell Senior’s Letters and Papers” in the Ivimy Archive now in the Fitzwilliam Museum).

The collection includes charmingly juvenile watercolor copies of pls. from Blake’s <em>Songs of Innocence</em>, <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>, and <em>For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</em>, the coloring of the children’s own invention. Acquired Aug. by a British private collector.</p>

        <p class="author"><em>Nightingale Valley</em>, ed. “Giraldus” (William Allingham), 1860 (<em>BB</em> #264). Jarndyce, Dec. 2010 online “Christmas” cat., no entry #, publisher’s cloth (£180). Includes 4 poems from Blake’s <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>. In a note, Allingham explains that “it remains to add that for the version of ‘The Tiger,’ here presented [95-96], differing somewhat from those hitherto published, use has been made of a MS. book of Blake’s, belonging to a friend of the editor, full of the oddest chaos of verses, drawings, and memoranda” (275-76). The “friend” was Dante Gabriel Rossetti and the “MS. book” was Blake’s Notebook. Allingham’s version is based loosely on drafts on pp. 108-09 of the Notebook, with punctuation added, spelling changed, and lines 15-18, 21-24 of the etched version omitted. He also made 2 substantive but unauthorized revisions, “ardour” for “fire” in the 2nd stanza (“Burnt the fire of thine eyes?” E 24) and “God” for “he” in the 4th (“Did he smile his work to see?” E 25). Allingham’s final line in the 3rd stanza (“What dread hand form’d thy dread feet?”) follows Blake’s manuscript revision in copy P of <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em> (see E 794). The ownership of copy P (now Getty Collection, Wormsley Library, Buckinghamshire) between 1855 and 1931 is unknown. Allingham’s notebook with transcriptions of poems from Blake’s Notebook is in the Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand; see D. F. McKenzie, “William Allingham’s Notebook of Poems by Blake,” <em>Turnbull Library Record</em> 1.3 (March 1968): 9-11.

It is remarkable that a complete translation of Blake’s epic would be published in Italy in 1943, a year in which the country fell into chaos as it was being invaded from the south by the British and Americans and from the north by the Germans. Ungaretti (1888-1970) was an important figure in 20th-century Italian literature and a supporter of Mussolini. Perhaps the translator’s connections with the fascist government, before its fall in July 1943, gave him special access to publishers and printers.</p>

				<p class="author">Listed below are substantive additions or corrections to Essick, <em>William Blake’s Commercial Book Illustrations</em> (1991).</p>
				<p class="author">Pp. 39-40, Fenning and Collyer, <em>A New System of Geography</em>, 1785-86, 1787. Copies of the 1785-86 issue in the Essick collection and in the Morris Miller Library, University of Tasmania, Hobart, include a previously unrecorded 2nd st. of pl. 1 in which the imprint is dated “July 16.<sup>th</sup> 1785” followed by a semi-colon.&nbsp;<a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fn10" name="fr10" id="fr10">[10]</a> In the 1st st. (British Library), the date is “June 6.<sup>th</sup> 1784” followed by a semi-colon. In the 3rd (previously 2nd) and final st., the imprint is dated “July 16.<sup>th</sup> 1787” followed by a comma. The attribution of this unsigned pl. to Blake as the engraver and Stothard as the designer is based only on a pencil inscription (by Robert Balmanno?) on a proof of the central design in the British Museum. Pl. 2 in the Essick copy of the 1785-86 issue is in the 2nd st., with a 1787 imprint, previously recorded only in copies of the 1787 issue.<br>
<em>BB</em> #455A lists only the British Library (designated “BM”) copy of the 1785-86 issue; copies of the 1787 issue are in the Explorers Club, New York (<em>BB</em> #455B), and in the University of Reading Library (<em>BBS</em> 213). As <em>CB</em> fig. 57 shows, Blake’s pl. 1 in the British Library copy is torn and abraded lower left. The copy of the 1785-86 issue in the Morris Miller Library is badly damaged by water; many leaves are stuck together and only part of Blake’s pl. 2 is visible. The University of Minnesota online library cat. does not list the 1787 issue located there by <em>BBS</em> 213. According to its online cat., a copy of the 1787 issue is in the Hennepin County Library, Minnetonka, Minnesota. For an illus. of and comments on Blake’s pl. 2, see <em>Blake</em> 36.4 (spring 2003): 124. A complete reproduction of the British Library copy of the 1785-86 issue is available on <em>Eighteenth Century Collections Online</em> &lt;﻿<a href="http://find.galegroup.com/ecco" target="_blank">http://find.galegroup.com/ecco</a>﻿&gt;.</p>
				<p class="author">Pp. 41-42, Lavater, <em>Essays on Physiognomy</em>. In the original issue of the work in parts, Blake’s pl. 1 was included in part 5, dated July 1788 on the printed back wrapper. The pl. is listed on the front wrapper as “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">7. aged figures, gardening</span>.” Blake’s pl. 2 was issued in part 3, dated May 1788, and is listed on the front wrapper as “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">7. democritus, finished</span>.”</p>
				<p class="author">Pp. 45-49, Darwin, <em>Botanic Garden</em>, 1st ed. of Part 1, 1791. For a copy that includes Blake’s pl. 6 of 1795, see the final entry on Darwin under <a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#Darwin">Letterpress Books with Engravings by and after Blake</a>, above. </p>

The complete set of prepublication proofs at the Bodleian Library, unseen at the time of writing, has now been listed on the Bodleian’s online cat. (&lt;﻿<a href="http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk</a>﻿&gt;, accessed 1 Nov. 2011).

				<p class="author">In my 2010 review I noted “a Small Etching” attributed to Blake, “representing Sampson destroying the Lion,” offered by A. E. Evans and Son in an 1845 cat. (<em>Blake</em> 44.4 [spring 2011]: 129). This is almost certainly the impression of “Samson and the Lion,” an etching by Welby Sherman, inscribed “WS / 1827” and acquired by the British Museum in 1847, accession no. 1847,0318.122. According to Campbell Dodgson, “The Engravings of George Richmond, R.A., and Welby Sherman,” <em>Print Collector’s Quarterly</em> 17.4 (Oct. 1930): 361, the museum’s impression was “bought as ‘an etching by Blake.’” Dodgson was keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum, 1912-32.</p></td></tr>

          <p><a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fr1" name="fn1" id="fn1">1</a>. This list is selective and based mainly on the annual installments of “Blake in the Marketplace” published in <em>Blake</em>. Posthumous impressions of Blake’s relief etchings and impressions of his more common separate plates, such as “Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims,” are not included. Only the rarest books with Blake’s commercial engravings are listed. In most cases, discoveries are recorded for the year they were published or became generally known.</p>
          <p><a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fr2" name="fn2" id="fn2">2</a>. The ownership of copy M remains unknown, but its existence in a private collection was reported by Ursus Rare Books, New York, in April 2009; see <em>Blake</em> 43.4 (spring 2010): 120.</p>
          <p><a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fr3" name="fn3" id="fn3">3</a>. See <em>BB</em> #128. Copy E, located by <em>BBS</em> 107 in the possession of “a private <em>American Collector</em>,” has been in the collection of Alan Parker, London, since Jan. 2007; see <em>Blake</em> 41.4 (spring 2008): 147. For copy M, listed as untraced in <em>BB</em>, see note 2, above. G. E. Bentley, Jr., “William Blake and His Circle: A Checklist of Publications and Discoveries in 2003,” <em>Blake</em> 38.1 (summer 2004): 11, suspects that “Copy Q?” might be the copy evaluated by Ursus Books, New York, in 2003. That is very probably copy M; copy Q has been in the Preston Blake Collection, City of Westminster Archives Centre (formerly Westminster Public Library), since 1966 (as recorded in <em>BB</em> 352). Geoffrey Keynes speculates that about fifty copies of <em>Poetical Sketches</em> may have been printed; see Keynes, <em>Blake Studies</em>, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1971) 34.</p>
          <p><a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fr4" name="fn4" id="fn4">4</a>. See the references to Blake’s execution of this plate in letters by Hayley and Blake, <em>BR</em>(2) 157 and E 736, 739, 744, 753, 757, 760. The portrait was intended as an illustration for Hayley’s <em>Life of George Romney</em>, but was not included in the book when published in 1809.</p>
          <p><a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fr5" name="fn5" id="fn5">5</a>. <em>BB</em> 343 describes the book as “4<sup>o</sup> (half sheet imposition): [A1-2], B-K4 (<em>J omitted</em>); signed on first two leaves of each quire except in quire A.” The leaves are signed and gathered in 4s, but the printing format is more properly described as an octavo (8<sup>o</sup>) in 4s, half-sheet imposition. For this format, see Philip Gaskell, <em>A New Introduction to Bibliography</em> (Oxford: Clarendon P, 1972) figs. 52 (half sheets of octavo worked together) and 53 (half sheet of octavo imposed for work and turn). In a quarto (4<sup>o</sup>) in half sheets (Gaskell figs. 48 and 49), the chain lines run horizontally; in an octavo in half sheets they run vertically, as in <em>Poetical Sketches</em>.</p>
          <p><a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fr6" name="fn6" id="fn6">6</a>. The leaves of copy C are the same thickness; those in copy S range between 0.09 and 0.11 mm. (both Huntington Library). These slight variations—at most 3 hundredths of a millimeter—within and among copies are to be expected in handmade paper.</p>
          <p><a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fr7" name="fn7" id="fn7">7</a>.  Geoffrey Keynes, <em>A Bibliography of William Blake</em> (New York: Grolier Club, 1921) 77, notes an even larger leaf size, “23 x 14 cm., uncut.” A completely uncut copy of a book printed as an octavo in half sheets will show deckle along the fore-edges of the 1st and 2nd leaves of each gathering in 4s and along the foot of every leaf. This copy of <em>Poetical Sketches</em> appears to have been trimmed slightly along the foot; only D2 shows evidence of deckle at its foot.</p>
          <p><a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fr8" name="fn8" id="fn8">8</a>. See <em>BB</em> 54-56 for a list of Blake’s books stabbed in this manner. The illuminated books were “done up [that is, bound] … by Mrs. Blake’s hand,” according to Alexander Gilchrist, <em>Life of William Blake</em>, vol. 1 (London: Macmillan, 1863) 70. Many of the illuminated books were printed on single leaves, and thus there were no folds through which to sew.</p>
          <p><a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fr9" name="fn9" id="fn9">9</a>. Jefferys was much influenced by Mortimer, Barry, and Fuseli. See Martin Butlin, “The Rediscovery of an Artist: James Jefferys 1751-1784,” <em>Blake</em> 10.4 (spring 1977): 123-24.</p>
          <p><a href="http://blakequarterly.org/index.php/blake/article/view/essick454/essick454html#fr10" name="fn10" id="fn10">10</a>. I am grateful to Luana J. Nandan of the Morris Miller Library for all information about the copy in that collection (e-mail, 16 March 2011).</p>
