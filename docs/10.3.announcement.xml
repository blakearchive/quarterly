          <p>It is not always remembered that the impression of the <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> belonging to
Sir Geoffrey Keynes is not unique, but that another one is recorded in <hi rend="i">Separate Plates.</hi>
According to Keynes it was last recorded at the George C. Smith sale in 1938 where it was bought by Sessler.
In the process of preparing with Deirdre Toomey an edition of <hi rend="i">The Complete Engravings of William
Blake</hi> for the publishers Thames and Hudson I set about tracking down the unique <hi rend="i">Death’s
Door</hi> engraving, the only one for <hi rend="i">Blair’s Grave</hi> engraved by Blake not Schiavonetti,
which had also not been seen since the 1930s. Thanks to a clue given me by Sir Geoffrey Keynes I eventually
located it in a the collection of Mrs. Charles T. Rosenbloom. To my surprise the owner also sent me a
photgraph of the second <hi rend="i">Laocoön</hi> impression, which I reproduce here. I have not yet been
able to see the print itself, but from the photograph there are a number of potentially interesting
differences. First of all it seems not to have been seriously damaged as Keynes suggests, and it seems to be
an earlier impression than the Keynes example, because there are still traces of work which has been cleaned
off the latter. The decorative flourish at the right, <corr type="emend">following</corr> “What we call 
Antique Gems,” was once balanced
by a similar one on the left, and engraved lines running from the left hand upper corner and the lower left
corner appear to be traces of an earlier format. Most tantalizing of all, however, are the unmistakable traces
of erased lettering all down the left hand side. They are not readable in the photograph, but there is some
hope that close inspection of the original will bring them out. What remains to be seen is whether these
traces will yield some additional epigrams. <byline><docAuthor>(David <name>Bindman</name>)</docAuthor></byline>
