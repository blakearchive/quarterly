                        The Gnomes were at work in issue number 1, and the following errors<lb/>
                        and omissions should be noted:<lb/>
                        The report on the Blake—Varley sketchbook (p. 2) appeared not in 
<hi rend="u">TLS</hi><lb/>
                        but in the London <hi rend="u">Times</hi>.  We thank Mr. Martin Butlin for pointing
this out<lb/>
                        and Miss Mary Hanna for having sent us the clipping.<lb/>
                        Mr. Fred Whithead, whom we again thank for a list of ongoing Blake pro-<lb/>
                        jects, was incorrectly renamed Robert.<lb/>
                        Our masthead was deisgned by Miss Amy Tsuji, who also compiled the list<lb/>
                        of articles on pp. 2-4 of number 1.  On page 3, we should have included the<lb/>
                        contributions by Fred C. Robinson to the December 1966 <hi rend="u">PMLA</hi>
discussion<lb/>
                        “Tense and the Sense of Blake’s ‘The Tyger’” (599-600, 602-603).<lb/>
                        On p. 7 (Stevenson note 3), there were two obvious typos for “Keynes”<lb/>
                        and “Greek.”<lb/>
                        All of which reminds us that the crooked roads without Improvement are<lb/>
                        roads of Genius.<lb/>

                    <p>One of the pleasantest results of publishing the Newsletter has been receiving letters
from many Blake scholars in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. All too often, I’m afraid, my answers have
been shorter and later than I could wish. This situation will probably get worse rather than better, as it
would be impossible for me to take the time to answer letters as they deserve <hi rend="u">and</hi> put out
the Newsletter, in addition to doing my own work. Therefore I ask the understanding and indulgence of our
readers, who have been (and will, I hope, continue to be) generous with their contributions of material and
comment.</p>
                    <p>This winter I expect to be travelling to a number of Blake collections, and although
mail will eventually reach me, forwarding may take as much as two weeks. It would be helpful if readers marked
Newsletter correspondence “Blake Newsletter” in the lower left hand corner of the envelope. In that way, I can
make whatever special arrangements are necessary more easily. The deadline for copy for the next issue is
December 10.</p>
