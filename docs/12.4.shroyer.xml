        <p>Despite several determined attempts to fix the dates of William Blake’s writings, interest in the
chronology of the poems continues, stimulated by the related concern to understand precisely Blake’s
relationship to his age. In this context, <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi> excites special interest
because of its many allusions to the contemporary scene and its importance as a central biographical
document.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n14" type="note">1</ref> The scholarly consensus
that Blake was writing <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> in 1784 is most forcefully represented by the arguments of
David Erdman and G. E. Bentley, Jr.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n15" type="note">2</ref>
Drawing upon the unpublished researches of Palmer Brown and Anne Buck,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n16" type="note">3</ref> these scholars argue that allusions to short-lived, contemporary fashions in
ladies’ dress, together with other supporting evidence, narrow the date of the manuscript to late 1784. In
this article I propose to go over the familiar ground mapped by Erdman and Bentley, and to argue that Blake
was very probably composing <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> in 1785 or perhaps slightly later.<supplied

	<note id="n17"><hi rend="s">4</hi> Among recent commentators on <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> I find only two
voices dissenting from the 1784 date. Nancy Bogen, “‘Island’ Revisited,” p. 115, postulates a slightly
later time of writing, “for if this work records actual events, chances are that it was written after the
events occurred, not while they were in progress” (p. 117). Kathleen Raine, <hi rend="i">Blake and
Tradition</hi> (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1969), I, 17, 379, dates <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> after
1787 on the grounds that the draft of “The Little Boy Lost” in chapter 11 shows that Blake was influenced by
Thomas Taylor’s translation of Plotinus’ <hi rend="i">Concerning the Beautiful</hi> (1787).</note></p>
        <p>In chapter 8 of <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> Miss Gittipin quickly wearies of her companions’
bookish talk and turns to her “favourite topic,” the supposed distance between her own cloistered life and the
freer social whirl of the Misses Double Elephant and Filligreework. “Im sure I never see any pleasure,”
laments Miss Gittipin,

        <p>Scholars agree that Blake was writing <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> during that relatively quiet
period in his life between the printing of <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> in 1783<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n19" type="note">6</ref> and the etching of <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> in
1789.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n20" type="note">7</ref> But narrowing the date within
this period depends in large part upon Miss Gittipin’s catalogue of “pleasures,” specifically “Balloon hats
. . . the sorrows of Werter &amp; Robinsons.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n21"
type="note">8</ref> “Balloon hats” so admired by Miss Gittipin were introduced into England from France in
late 1783. In December 1783 the <hi rend="i">European Magazine</hi>’s “Man Milliner” regretted the
inconvenience of the cumbersome style of hat though he had to admit that the “engaging actress, Miss Farren,
[who] wore one of these whimsical hats this evening, in the character of Estifania . . . lost none of her
beauty under it.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n22" type="note">9</ref> Elizabeth Farren

balloon hats and “Robinsons,” various items of dress associated with Mary “Perdita” Robinson.<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n26" type="note">13</ref> These fashions flourished through the summer
season and into the autumn of 1784, when the chill winds forced the closing of Vauxhall. 
<note id="n19"><hi rend="s">6</hi> If the “Advertisement” to <hi rend="i">Poetical Sketches</hi> (<hi rend="i">Poetry and
Prose</hi>, p. 764) does not exaggerate Blake’s devotion to his “profession” of engraving and his consequent
neglect of poetry during 1778-83, then <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> must be later than 1783. Erdman, 
<hi rend="i">Prophet</hi>, pp. 92-93, dismisses the older view that <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> reflects Blake’s
break with the “Mathew Circle” in 1784, but it is possible that the Mathews’ 
<hi rend="i">conversaziones</hi> were the occasion for, though not the specific targets of, Blake’s satire. J.
T. Smith, <hi rend="i">Nollekens and His Times</hi> (London, 1829), II, 464, says that after 1783 “Blake’s
visits” to the Mathews “were not so frequent,” which suggests that the break may have been gradual rather than
sudden.</note>
	<note id="n20"><hi rend="s">7</hi> By 1789 Blake had revised, illustrated, and etched three songs found in
<hi rend="i">An Island</hi>, chapter 11, as “Holy Thursday,” “The Little Boy Lost,” and “Nurse’s Song” of
<hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi> (title page dated 1789).</note>
	<note id="n21"><hi rend="s">8</hi> Other objects envied by Miss Gittipin do not help to pinpoint the date of
<hi rend="i">An Island.</hi> “Stormonts” were almost certainly items of dress associated with Louisa Cathcart,
the second wife of David Murray, Seventh Viscount Stormont. Anne Buck (letter of 8 Aug. 1952 to L. A. Holder)
found “Stormont gowns” mentioned in the <hi rend="i">Lady’s Magazine</hi> for March, 1781. I have found no
reference to “Stormonts” during the period 1783-89. The “Queen of Frances Puss [i.e., puce] colour,” on the
other hand, is found in the fashion columns throughout this period and is therefore irrelevant to the question
of date. It may be of some interest to note that the coaches so envied by Miss Gittipin were the objects of
heavy taxation during 1785. See the <hi rend="i">Daily Universal Register</hi> for 24 September 1785.</note>

spot. Vauxhall normally opened on Easter Monday, but in 1785 it opened several weeks later, on 19 May. See 
<hi rend="i">Eur. Mag.</hi>, 7 (May 1785), 356.</note>
	<note id="n26"><hi rend="s">13</hi> Balloon hats were fashionable during the 1784 season. See 
<hi rend="i">Eur. Mag.</hi>, 4 (Dec. 1783), 406, <hi rend="i">Gazetteer</hi> for 31 Jan., 9 Feb., 19 Feb., 11 June
1784, and <hi rend="i">Morning Herald, and Daily Advertiser</hi>, 18 Sept. 1784, for a sample of the accounts
of this fashion. “Robinson” gowns, hats, and other apparel were fashionable from the early 1780’s. See 
<hi rend="i">Lady’s Mag.</hi>, 14 (March 1783), 121; (April, 1783), 187; (May 1783), 268; (Dec. 1783), 650; 15
(March 1784), 154; (June 1784), 303.</note></p>
        <p>Like “Robinsons,” Miss Filligreework’s “sorrows of Werter” probably included a fairly large
number of stylish hats and dresses inspired by Goethe’s popular book during the 1780’s, but if so these
fashions have not been traced. The earliest known reference to such a style appeared after the close of
Vauxhall in the <hi rend="i">Gazetteer</hi> of 9 December 1784. There the “<hi rend="i">Werter bonnet</hi>” is
reported to be “much the rage.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n27" type="note">14</ref>
	<note id="n27"><hi rend="s">14</hi> “Werter” bonnets were reported in the <hi rend="i">Gazetteer</hi> for 16
Dec. 1784 and 13 Jan. 1785 (first noticed by Palmer Brown).</note></p>
        <p>But the real question for the date of <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> is whether balloon hats,
Robinsons, and Werters survived the winter months of 1784-85 and were to be seen when the pleasure gardens
opened in the spring of 1785. On 26 July 1785 the <hi rend="i">Gazetteer</hi> announced: “The balloon hat has
had its day;—the Werter, Lunardi, and Gypsey are now on the decline, while the umbrella bonnet is making
rapid advances.” This statement, together with the absence of other references to these fashions in 1785, and
the disappearance of Perdita Robinson from the fashionable scene after 1784,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n28" type="note">15</ref> have been taken to mean that balloon hats, Robinsons, and
Werters were old hat by the beginning of 1785. From my reading of the fashion columns of these years, however,
I rather suspect that a journalist writing late in July—very late in the London “season”—would be unlikely
to write an obituary on a style six months dead. More probably, balloon hats had by late July been replaced
fairly recently, while Werter bonnets were, as he says, “on the decline” but still visible. That Blake could
have seen, heard of, or read about these fashions in 1785 and used them in <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> seems
to be very probable. <note id="n28"><hi rend="s">15</hi> The precise date of Perdita’s illness and
subsequent departure for the spas of Europe is in dispute. For a sentimentalized account, see 
<hi rend="i">Memoirs of the Late Mrs. Robinson</hi> (London, 1803), II, 95-98. The <hi rend="i">Gazetteer</hi>, 28
Dec. 1784, includes the rumor that “Perdita is returned from Paris” while the same newspaper for 18 Jan. 1785
announced her fall from fashion.</note></p>
        <p>That Blake was writing <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> in 1785 or slightly later gains support when one
considers Miss Gittipin’s friend Mr. Jacko who “knows what riding is.” Jacko, according to David Erdman, is
Blake’s caricature of Richard Cosway, the “mushroom-rich miniature painter and . . . fabulous dandy” known
for his simian features.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n29" type="note">16</ref> Erdman
traces the name “Jacko” to “General Jacko,” identified by M. D. George in the <hi rend="i">Catalogue of
Political and Personal Satires in the British Museum</hi> as “an astonishing monkey from the fair of St.
Germain’s, Paris, who performed at Astley’s Amphitheatre during the summer of 1784.”<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n30" type="note">17</ref> Since Astley’s was primarily an equestrian
circus, the link between General Jacko and Blake’s Mr. Jacko who “knows what riding is” seems plausible
enough. And, of course, General Jacko’s appearance in 1784 is consistent with the date of <hi rend="i">An
Island</hi> established by Erdman on other grounds. <note id="n29"><hi rend="s">16</hi> Erdman, 
<hi rend="i">Prophet</hi>, p. 96. Erdman notes that Cosway was called “little Jack-a-dang” but he does not say
when. J. T. Smith, <hi rend="i">Nollekens</hi>, II, 407, claimed that the following undated lines attributed
to Peter Pindar were attached to Cosway’s door, which was guarded by two stone lions:
<q>
When a man to a fair for a show brings a lion, ’Tis usual a monkey the sign-post to tie on: But here the old
custom reversed is seen, For the lion’s without—and the monkey’s within.

        <p>M. D. George, however, appears to be a year off in dating the French ape’s English
engagement.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n31" type="note">18</ref> A search of the
newspapers for 1784 reveals no reference to General Jacko. The <hi rend="i">Gazetteer</hi>, which regularly
carried advertisements for Philip Astley’s Westminster-Bridge circus, makes no mention of Jacko among the
many performers of the 1784 season (21 April-14 October). But in April 1785 both the 
<hi rend="i">Gazetteer</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Daily Universal Register</hi> (later <hi rend="i">The Times</hi>)
announced Jacko’s exhibition in language that unmistakably identifies the monkey as a new arrival on the
London theatrical scene.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n32" type="note">19</ref> The 
<hi rend="i">Gazetteer</hi> for 4 April 1785 proclaimed:

Paris, who has been celebrated for his astonishing Performances on the TIGHTROPE, and other Exercises, which
are beyond Conception.
</q>
Throughout the summer of 1785 General Jacko was one of Astley’s featured entertainers. By September Jacko
was dividing his talents between Astley’s and the rival Sadler’s Wells and Royal Circus where, dressed in
red, he rode a horse called Marplot.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n33" type="note">20</ref>
Although Jacko’s manifest appeal for English audiences in 1785 suggests that he probably performed somewhere
in London in the following year, evidently Astley did not renew Jacko’s contract when the Amphitheatre
re-opened Easter Monday, 17 April 1786.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n34"

        <p>The question of course is what to do with this monkey business. At the least we may re-date c. 1785
the satirical engraving, “The Downfall of Taste &amp; Genius or The World as it goes” (illus. 1), attributed

he said to ride a horse. Further, the name “Jacko” may have been, like “Jocko” following Buffon’s coinage of
1766,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n40" type="note">27</ref> a fairly common name for a
monkey in the late eighteenth century. For example, the <hi rend="i">Morning Herald, and Daily Advertiser</hi>
for 2 December 1784 included a poem in the manner of Gray’s mock-elegiac <hi rend="i">Ode on the Death of a

For Death, the parent of all dread,<lb/>
Nor man nor monkey can controul;<lb/>
So <hi rend="i">Jackoe</hi> finds it—now he’s dead—<lb/>
Old maids, have mercy on his soul!
</q>
There exists, moreover, a long tradition of English combinations of “Jack” and “ape” that might have inspired
Blake to construct a comic name for Miss Gittipin’s friend like those given to other islanders. And,
finally, if the claim in the newspapers of 1785 is not merely advertising puffery, then General Jacko had been
“celebrated for these Two Years last past”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n41"
type="note">28</ref> and Blake could have heard of the French ape before his English tour of 1785.

        <p>There are, then, several plausible explanations for Blake’s use of the name Jacko, but none, I
would urge, more probable than Blake’s awareness of General Jacko’s much publicized equestrian act of
1785. Nor does the other evidence usually taken to date <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> 1784 contradict this later
date. The explicit reference to the Royal Academy Exhibition, the possible allusion to the Handel Festival of
1784, and the identification of Quid the Cynic’s plan for “Illuminating the Manuscript” (ch. 11) all admit
of differing interpretations and cannot be decisive as to date.</p>
        <p>In chapter 7 Suction the Epicurean, who may be smarting from a recent disappointment, says “If I
dont knock them all up next year in the Exhibition Ill be hangd.” From the context it is clear that Suction
looks forward to the annual Royal Academy Exhibition in May. Though Suction has never been identified as
Blake, the fact that Blake contributed paintings to the Royal Academy exhibits in 1780, 1784, 1785, and not
again until 1799 has been taken as evidence that Suction is speaking sometime in May-December 1784 of the 1785
exhibition the following year.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n42" type="note">29</ref> But
this is to confuse a fictional character’s hypothetical ambition with the author’s actual performance. In
any event we do not know that Blake did not intend to exhibit in 1786. <note id="n42"><hi rend="s">29</hi> For

target="n44" type="note">31</ref> reflected in Blake’s Doctor Clash and Signior Falalasole are familiar
subjects of eighteenth-century satire. But, even granting that the mention of “handels waterpiece” might
suggest a Handel Festival, such festivals were held in Westminster Abbey and the Pantheon not only in 1784,
but also in 1785, 1786, and 1787.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n45" type="note">32</ref>

        <p>The identification of Quid’s proposal on the final page of text for “Illuminating the Manuscript”
with George Cumberland’s plan to produce engraved mirror writing is similarly inconclusive. Once taken to be
an allusion to Blake’s own method of illuminated printing, Quid’s ambitious plan is identified by Erdman
and Bentley with Cumberland’s because Cumberland, like Quid, proposed to print “2000” copies of any work by
his method.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n46" type="note">33</ref> But Quid’s proposal is
not sufficiently detailed to be confidently equated with either Blake’s or Cumberland’s. The published
reports in late 1784 of Cumberland’s “New Mode of Printing”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n47" type="note">34</ref> do not include the number of potential copies, and to assume that Cumberland
told Blake privately of his plan may be to pile conjecture upon conjecture without hope of discovering the
facts of the case. <note id="n46"><hi rend="s">33</hi> Damon, <hi rend="i">Philosophy and Symbols</hi>, pp.
32-33, identified Quid’s plan as Blake’s own. For the Quid-Cumberland link, see Erdman, 
<hi rend="i">Prophet</hi>, p. 100, and Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Books</hi>, p. 222. For Blake’s early
friendship with Cumberland, see G. E. Bentley, Jr., <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> (Oxford: Clarendon, 1969),
pp. 17, 362. Cumberland’s letter to his brother of early 1784 in which he proposes to print 2,000 copies of
his engraved writing is B. M. Add. MS. 36494, fol. 232, transcribed by Geoffrey Keynes, <hi rend="i">Blake
Studies: Essays on His Life and Work</hi>, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon, 1971), pp. 231-32.</note>
	<note id="n47"><hi rend="s">34</hi> Cumberland published a description of his “New Mode of Printing” in Henry
Maty’s <hi rend="i">A New Review; with Literary Curiosities, and Literary Intelligence</hi>, 6 (Oct. 1784),
318-19. Although Erdman, <hi rend="i">Prophet</hi>, p. 100 fn. 22, says it is “hard to think who” Cumberland
might be in <hi rend="i">An Island</hi>, it would seem logical to identify Cumberland with Quid on the
evidence Erdman presents. One might argue that Quid, like Cumberland and unlike Blake with whom he is almost
always identified, does not seem to be a professional engraver or printer. Quid says that he “would have all
the writing Engraved instead of Printed” and that “they would Print off two thousand” copies. One could see
George “Candid” Cumberland, a mere amateur engraver and printer, farming out the production of these
volumes.</note></p>
        <p>Although these allusions do not help us to pinpoint the year in which Blake composed 
<hi rend="i">An Island</hi>, some of them may help to indicate the season in which the action of the satire is
supposed to occur. In addition to the annual spring celebration by the charity school children of “Holy
Thursday,”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n48" type="note">35</ref> the annual Royal Academy
exhibitions in May,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n49" type="note">36</ref> the spring music
festivals, and the “high fashion” season of Vauxhall and Ranelagh, there is Steelyard the Lawgiver’s song,
“As I walkd forth one may morning” (ch. 9), and a reference to cricket in chapter 11, a game played during the
warm spring and summer months. The Antiquarian’s swallows that “seemd to be going on their passage” (ch.
1)<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n50" type="note">37</ref> suggests either an autumn or a
spring migration, while, on the other side, the song in chapter 11 celebrating the victory of William the
Prince of Orange in November 1688 would, I suppose, be most appropriate to one of the yearly celebrations of
that event in November. <note id="n48"><hi rend="s">35</hi> The annual charity school service described in the
draft of “Holy Thursday” (ch. 11) was first held in St. Paul’s Cathedral on 2 May 1782, and annually
thereafter (e.g., 12 June 1783, 10 June 1784, 26 May 1785, 1 June 1786, 7 June 1787, 5 June 1788, 28 May 1789)
until late in the nineteenth century. For the distinction between these services and the “Holy Thursdays” of
the church calendar see W. H. Stevenson, ed., <hi rend="i">The Poems of William Blake</hi>, text ed. by David
V. Erdman, Longman Annotated English Poets (London: Longman, 1971), p. 60 fn., and Thomas E. Connolly, “The
Real ‘Holy Thursday’ of William Blake,” <hi rend="i">Blake Studies</hi>, 6 (1975), 179-87.</note>
	<note id="n49"><hi rend="s">36</hi> As Erdman observes (<hi rend="i">Prophet</hi>, p. 91 fn.), Suction’s
reference to “next year” would be most appropriate from May to December, though I have heard “academics” of a
different sort refer to next year, i.e., the Sept. school opening, in July.</note>
	<note id="n50"><hi rend="s">37</hi> Even this passing reference to swallows may reflect Blake’s awareness
of the contemporary dispute over the migration and hibernation theories to which John Hunter and Samuel
Johnson (both mentioned in <hi rend="i">An Island</hi>) contributed. See Jean Dorst, <hi rend="i">The
Migration of Birds</hi>, trans. C. D. Sherman (London: Heineman, 1962), pp. 3, 8-9. “Pliny,” cited by
Blake’s Antiquarian, was usually cited by the hibernationists.</note></p>
        <p>In sum, Blake was probably composing <hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi> during the spring (or
perhaps the autumn) of 1785 when General Jacko was performing for London audiences his exercises “beyond
Conception” and the styles of dress envied by Miss Gittipin were still fresh in the public mind. Yet it is
difficult to claim that 1785 is more than a probable <hi rend="i">terminus a quo</hi> for the unique
manuscript in the Fitzwilliam Museum. David Erdman observes, perhaps too confidently, that the manuscript was
“obviously copied from an earlier draft, the most frequent revision being a second thought replacing a word
just written down.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n51" type="note">38</ref> G. E. Bentley,
Jr. concludes from the evidence of changes in handwriting, inks, and pen-points that there were “seven stages
of work”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n52" type="note">39</ref> on the text. Though I have
not seen positive evidence that <hi rend="i">An Island</hi> is later than 1785, if these scholars are right,
then it is not impossible that Blake was writing this manuscript slightly later than the events alluded to,
perhaps over a period of time. <note id="n51"><hi rend="s">38</hi> Erdman, <hi rend="i">Poetry and Prose</hi>,
p. 766.</note>
	<note id="n52"><hi rend="s">39</hi> Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Booke</hi>, p. 223.</note></p>
        <p>The evidence of fashions and trained animals, then, does not provide as conclusive a date for 
<hi rend="i">An Island</hi> as one would wish to have, though it does redefine the limits of our uncertainty. One
happy side effect of knowing about learned pigs and wonderful hares may be of interest to readers of Blake. I
for one now have a clearer sense of Blake’s meaning in the bitter and ironic directive found on page 40 of
<hi rend="i">The Notebook</hi>:

Or the Hare playing on a Tabor<lb/>
