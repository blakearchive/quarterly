Bentley&amp;rsquo;s two editions of  Blake Records ,  Blake Records Supplement , and his 2001 biography,  The Stranger from Paradise , but the scholarly alchemy effected by distilling reports of Blake&amp;rsquo;s spoken words into a compact volume and adding an array of related tools has created something rich, strange, and likely to prove enduringly useful. Because many of the reports come to us from within a generation or two after Blake&amp;rsquo;s death, they are strongly colored by the late Georgian/early Victorian conception of him: these Blakeish words often seem to reflect the minds of the reporters as much as they reveal the mind of Blake, and as the intervening years and layers of reportage multiply, the share of credible Blake content diminishes. A snippet of Blake&amp;rsquo;s conversation that was worth retelling or recording is likely to have been one that conformed to, or at least resonated with, the other stories about Blake in circulation at the time. Gathered together in largely unmediated form, these reports constitute a portrait of a fellow we might call Anecdotal Blake, a somewhat different being from the persona we moderns know through his works in ink and paint, Autographic Blake. Ironically, Autographic Blake was not very well known to some of the original constructors of Anecdotal Blake&amp;mdash;even to ones who knew Flesh and Blood Blake himself. Those modern readers who are thoroughly acquainted with Autographic Blake may find the shimmery Anecdotal Blake who rises in these pages to be an uncanny and alien creature, but it is intriguing to hear his voice, and like any chatty ghost he may have things to tell us beyond the grave.

 but the scholarly alchemy effected by distilling reports of Blake’s

largely unmediated form, these reports constitute a portrait of a fellow
 we might call Anecdotal Blake, a somewhat different being from the 
persona we moderns know through his works in ink and paint, Autographic 
Blake. Ironically, Autographic Blake was not very well known to some of 
the original constructors of Anecdotal Blake—even to ones who knew Flesh
 and Blood Blake himself. Those modern readers who are thoroughly 
acquainted with Autographic Blake may find the shimmery Anecdotal Blake 
who rises in these pages to be an uncanny and alien creature, but it is

      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">2</td>
      <td class="body">The book begins with an insightful foreword by 
Mary Lynn Johnson, followed by an engaging set of introductory gestures 
and prolegomena, most of them a few paragraphs long, by Bentley, then 
the collected “conversations” themselves. This is a very mixed bag that 
includes any text that plausibly but indirectly records a Blake 
statement or something like a Blake statement, even words that he 
probably did not say, such as the seditious utterings reported in the 
testimony of the soldier who invaded Blake’s garden in Felpham. 
Presumably the rationale for including this report is that the 
confrontation definitely did occur and all agree that Blake said 
something. By contrast, the famous story of naked Blake saying, “Come 
in, it’s only Adam and Eve, you know!” to Thomas Butts in the 
summer-house is not here (except at least two mentions as an example of 
what did not make the cut). Though it is only a little less likely on 
its face than many of the other anecdotes from the same period, the Adam
 and Eve story is probably apocryphal from top to bottom, and its 
omission is well deserved. Yet Bentley casts the net for Blakean 
“conversations” very broadly, including, for instance, at least one 
unspoken report of a vision reportedly found in a lost letter from Blake
 to Butts (see below), a fictive conversation between a Blakean persona 
and Isaiah and Ezekiel from <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> (10), and an assertion that Blake’s wife said she didn’t know what Blake meant by <em>The Book of Urizen</em>
 (13). The entries are arranged in rough chronological order, when 
possible by year of purported utterance, extending from a retrospective 
account of Blake’s telling his mother of angels on Peckham Rye in 1767, 
to 1831, with the last imagined echoes of Blake’s voice, audible at most
 to Catherine on her deathbed, as she called out “continually to her 
William, as if he were only in the next room” (81). They are minimally 
annotated as to source, but most are not otherwise contextualized or 
qualified. Bentley’s commodious criteria make sense: why omit a 
potentially illuminating bit of second-order information merely because 
it was not really a conversation, or because it didn’t actually involve 
Blake’s saying anything (as in the <em>Urizen</em> story above, which usefully indicates that Blake <em>didn’t</em>
 talk to Catherine about what some of his works meant), and why clutter 
the book with inevitably inconclusive assessments of the veracity of the
 reports?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">3</td>
      <td class="body">Bentley’s broad definition of “conversation” has 
payoffs: if he had been more exclusionary he might, for instance, have 
omitted the anecdote reported at second or third hand by Oswald Crawfurd
 about a vision Blake supposedly had (and supposedly “afterwards 
records” somewhere) during his apprenticeship at Basire’s, “when he was 
one day … secluded in … Westminster Abbey.” Crawfurd says that Blake 
reported (apparently in a lost letter to Butts, not in an actual 
conversation) that he saw “one of his visions”: “the aisles and 
galleries of the old building (or sanctuary) suddenly filled with a 
great procession of monks and priests, choristers and censer-bearers” 
(3). This sounds at first like one more of those early accounts that 
focus on Blake as a man who saw spirits, and the language is utterly 
unlike Blake’s, so one might discount it. But in this case there may be a
 nonverbal echo of such a vision “afterwards record[ed]” by Blake in 
later life, though it is unlikely that Crawfurd would have known about 
it. Among the recently discovered designs to Blair’s <em>Grave</em> is 
an unengraved picture that Flaxman called “The Gambols of Ghosts 
according with their affections previous to the final Judgment,” 
representing the nocturnal activities of phantoms in a churchyard. 
Blake’s scene elaborates upon a passage early in Blair’s poem that 
describes “light-heeled ghosts and visionary shades” that “perform their
 mystic rounds” around a “trusty yew” beneath “the wan cold moon.” The 
rediscovered watercolor design (which is clearly developed from a sketch
 that is now in the Yale Center for British Art) shows a churchyard 
occupied by three distinct classes of ghosts performing their “rounds” 
in their own ways: six “light-heeled” dancers circling the yew, another 
larger circle of violent quarrelers, victims, and victimizers, and an 
orderly right-to-left procession of the host composed of pious 
“visionary shades” bearing tapers, huge tomes, and bread and wine into 
the church. Blake’s decision to expand the population of Blair’s 
churchyard in this particular way may have been inspired in part by a 
thirty-year-old vision of a ghostly parade in Westminster Abbey.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">4</td>
      <td class="body">In addition to the snippets of conversation 
themselves, Bentley includes several conversation-related scholarly 
tools. The most useful is probably the concordance of the words used in 
the reported conversations, but interesting as well are the speculative 
remarks in the introduction on Blake’s pronunciation and the 
implications of rhymes (xxi-xxxv) and the supporting tables of perfect 
and imperfect rhymes in the appendices. Throughout the volume Bentley 
maintains a much lighter scholarly demeanor than one might expect from 
the author of those magisterial classics, <em>Blake Books</em> and <em>Blake Records</em>—this
 assemblage is hosted by Conversational Bentley, a manifestation of the 
generous and genial Flesh and Blood Bentley that the lucky may meet in 
person. This Bentley is much too polite and good-natured to acknowledge,
 say, that a plausible thirdhand anecdote might be unreliable—all tales 
are treasured here, and accorded pretty much the same respect as an 
entertaining raconteur at dinner. Similarly, the evidence to be found in
 Blake’s rhymes about the way he probably pronounced words is 
fascinating but so oblique that it would be difficult to use without 
extensive qualification. Though there is a danger that some will treat 
this whole judicious assemblage of somewhat problematic facts as having 
the same kind of authority as Blake’s own words, the lightheartedly 
learned tone that prevails should inhibit anyone from taking it all too 
literally.</td>
