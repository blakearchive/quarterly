	<meta name="DC.Description" xml:lang="en" content=" The stimulus for this investigation of manuscript variants in one of Blake&amp;rsquo;s Notebook poems arises from an unlikely quarter: Kurt Vonnegut&amp;rsquo;s  God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater  (1965). Vonnegut&amp;rsquo;s use of Blake is purposeful. In  Slaughterhouse-Five  the narrator states (by way of Kilgore Trout) that &amp;ldquo;William Blake&amp;rdquo; was &amp;ldquo;[Eliot] Rosewater&amp;rsquo;s favorite poet&amp;rdquo; (99), and in a 1977 interview in the  Paris Review  Vonnegut specifically notes, &amp;ldquo;I was thirty-five before I went crazy about Blake.&amp;rdquo; In  Rosewater , Eliot Rosewater, traumatized by his experience in World War II, dedicates his life and extraordinary wealth to a compensatory form of philanthropy for the population of Rosewater, Indiana. Eliot has written his personal manifesto on the step risers leading up to his office to remind himself and his clients of his life&amp;rsquo;s purpose and personal vision. His manifesto is identified in Vonnegut&amp;rsquo;s text only as &amp;ldquo;a poem by William Blake&amp;rdquo; (65). The poem is traditionally referred to by its first line, &amp;ldquo;The Angel that presided o&amp;rsquo;er my birth,&amp;rdquo; as rendered in Keynes&amp;rsquo;s Nonesuch edition, almost certainly Vonnegut&amp;rsquo;s source. Obscuring Blake&amp;rsquo;s rhyme scheme, Vonnegut separates the three-line poem into twelve sections, one for each riser. ">

<p class="note"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">David W. Ullrich</span> (<a href="mailto:dullrich@bsc.edu">dullrich@bsc.edu</a>)
 is professor of literature at Birmingham-Southern College. He divides 
his research interests between British romanticism and twentieth-century
 American literature. His recent (2012) publications include an article

<span style="padding-left: 125px">(Letter to Thomas Butts, 22 November 1802)</span></p>
<p>The stimulus for this investigation of manuscript variants in one of Blake’s Notebook
poems arises from an unlikely quarter: Kurt Vonnegut’s <em>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</em> (1965). Vonnegut’s
use of Blake is purposeful. In <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em> the narrator states (by
way of Kilgore Trout) that “William Blake” was “[Eliot] Rosewater’s favorite
poet” (99), <span class="notecall">and in a 1977 interview in the <em>Paris Review</em> Vonnegut specifically notes, “I was thirty-five before I went
crazy about Blake.”</span><span class="sidenote">Vonnegut comments, “I couldn’t play games with my literary
ancestors, since I had never studied them systematically. My education was as a chemist at
Cornell and then an anthropologist at the University of Chicago. Christ—I was thirty-five before I went
crazy about Blake …” (Hayman et al.
72). Vonnegut was born in 1922. “Thirty-five” years later, 1957, Keynes’s Nonesuch edition of Blake’s <em>Complete
Writings</em> was published.</span> In <em>Rosewater</em>,
Eliot Rosewater, traumatized by his experience in World War II, dedicates his
life and extraordinary wealth to a compensatory form of philanthropy for the
population of Rosewater, Indiana. Eliot has written his personal manifesto on the step risers leading up
to his office to remind himself and his clients of his life’s purpose and
personal vision. <span class="notecall">His manifesto
is identified in Vonnegut’s text only as “a poem by William Blake” (65).</span><span class="sidenote">Eliot’s father
offers a rebuttal to his son’s manifesto by quoting “another poem by Blake”
(65), stanza 3 of “The Clod &amp; the Pebble.”</span> The poem is traditionally referred to
by its first line, “The Angel that presided o’er my birth,” as rendered in
Keynes’s Nonesuch edition, almost certainly Vonnegut’s source. Sacrificing Blake’s rhyme scheme, Vonnegut
separates the three-line poem into twelve sections, one for each riser:
</p><blockquote>The Angel<br>
that presided<br>
o’er my<br>
birth said,<br>
“Little creature,<br>
form’d of<br>
Joy &amp; Mirth,<br>
Go love<br>
without the<br>
help of<br>
any Thing<br>
on Earth.”</blockquote>
Restored
to its original stanzaic form, Blake’s poem, a triplet in fairly regular iambic
meter and monosyllabic rhymes, reads as follows:
<blockquote>The Angel that presided o’er my birth<br>
Said, “Little creature, form’d of Joy &amp; Mirth,<br>
“Go love without the help of any Thing on Earth.” (Keynes, <em>Complete Writings</em> 541)</blockquote>
<p>In tracking down “The
Angel that presided” in Blake’s canon, I have identified three transcriptions of
the poem. <span class="notecall">Keynes (1957), Erdman
(1965, rev. 1988), and Bentley (1978) each record a different transcription of
Blake’s revisions.</span><span class="sidenote">This essay does not address the different editorial policies
regarding the punctuation or modernization of Blake’s poem.</span> The variant readings are not trivial; each
version significantly alters the poem’s meaning. Moreover, the editors disagree
on interpreting Blake’s handwriting in a crucial word.</p>
<p>As an orientation point, Erdman’s facsimile edition, <em>The Notebook of
William Blake</em> (1977), identifies the poem as “Poem 98,” found on
page 32 of Blake’s Notebook (<em>Notebook</em> N32 and N32 transcript). Erdman estimates the date
of composition as “after Oct. 1807” but “before <em>PA</em>” (<em>Public Address</em>) or
“before May 1809” (<em>Notebook</em> 56). Cross-referencing
key words of “The Angel that presided” in <em>A
Concordance to the Writings of William Blake</em> indicates that no other
version of this poem exists; in other words, Blake never incorporated it
into another, larger poem. Illus. 1 reproduces the poem; illus. 2, 3, and 4 reproduce the
transcriptions from Keynes, Erdman, and Bentley, complete with their editorial annotations.
However, even the reproduction of the original does not provide a
definitive answer as to which version is most likely correct, as Blake’s
informal handwriting is very difficult to transcribe, especially in inked-over
layers. <a name="illus1" id="illus1"></a>

</div>
<p>Substantial
differences occur in the concluding line of the poem. Keynes transcribes the last line as “Go love without the help
of any Thing on Earth.” <span class="notecall">In his editorial annotations, he records
Blake’s revisions, which, as shown in <a href="#illus2">illus. 2</a>, consist of deleting “thou art formd for Mirth” and replacing it with “formd of Joy &amp;
Mirth.”</span><span class="sidenote">I have omitted Keynes’s apostrophe in “form’d” because it is not present in Blake’s text.</span> However, Keynes makes no
comment on Blake’s hypothetical revision of “Thing” to “King,” which both Erdman
and Bentley later append (illus. <a href="#illus3">3</a> and <a href="#illus4">4</a>). Moreover, he evidently sees no reason to replace “love” with “live,” as Bentley is compelled to do later (<a href="#illus4">illus. 4</a>).</p>
<p>In the facsimile edition, Erdman scrupulously
documents any differences between his editorial decisions and Keynes’s previous
transcription. Following the general
editorial practices outlined in “Explanation of the Transcript” (<em>Notebook</em> [65]), one can infer that, in
Erdman’s opinion, Blake wrote “King” over “Thing” in his revision of the poem (illus. 5).
</p><div class="illus"><img src="584.jpg" border="1px solid black" height="119" width="600">
<div class="caption">5. David V. Erdman, ed., with the assistance of Donald K. Moore, <em>The Notebook of William Blake: A Photographic and Typographic Facsimile</em>, rev. ed. (N.p.: Readex Books, 1977) N32 transcript.</div>
</div>
Erdman
notes that “Poem 98” was “begun and revised in grey ink … then further
revised and completed in black” (N32 transcript, note). This implies that Blake’s hypothetical revision
of “Thing” to “King” was sufficiently persuasive to Erdman’s eye—perhaps even color coded,
so to speak—to warrant an alternative reading to Keynes’s transcription. His choice of “King” over “Thing” seems
compelling. In fact, Erdman selects “King” in his first (1965) edition of
Blake’s work (493), which precedes the <em>Notebook</em> facsimile,
and he retains “King” in his revised (1988) edition (see <a href="#illus3">illus. 3</a>). In each edition, he provides the textual
note “King]&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>mended from</em> Thing (but
not very clear)” (781, 864). (Bentley’s
editorial choice concurs with Erdman’s in this respect.)
<p>To complicate matters further, other editions of Blake’s work vary in their choice of “Thing” or “King,”
even when relying on the same source. For example, Stevenson’s <em>Blake:
The Complete Poems</em> (2007), which “tak[es] account of Erdman’s work on the
Notebook” (xiii), selects (a modernized, lowercase) “king” while noting
“altered probably from <em>Thing</em>” (626). However, Johnson and Grant’s <em>Blake’s Poetry and Designs</em> (2008) chooses “Thing” (385),
even as they, too, state that their <span class="notecall">“selections [from the Notebook] are based on Erdman’s edition,
compared with the Erdman-Moore facsimile” (379n).</span><span class="sidenote">In reference to their selection, Johnson and Grant explain that
they “attempt to present each work at an optimum stage of realization by
eliminating early drafts and, occasionally, what we consider to be uninspired
afterthoughts” (379n). Presumably they suppress “King” because they judge it to be an
“uninspired afterthought.”</span> Ostriker’s <em>William Blake: The Complete
Poems</em> (1977) uses editorial brackets—“[Thing] King”—to indicate “a 
word … emended in the manuscript” (10); hence, she favors “King” (626).</p>
<p>Of course, Erdman’s selection of “King”
over “Thing” changes the poem dramatically, and these implications will be
explored shortly. However, one
more editorial issue must be addressed. While Keynes and Erdman both record without comment “Go love,” Bentley
substitutes “live” for “love,” also without comment, noting only “[Thing [<em>altered to</em>] King[<em>?</em>] on Earth<span style="font-size: 10px">⎣</span>.<span style="font-size: 10px">⎦</span>” (see <a href="#illus4">illus.
4</a>). Bentley’s question mark after “King” suggests that he, like Erdman, is not completely
certain of the alteration. However, by the same logic, his lack of editorial
comment with respect to “live” suggests that he is absolutely certain that “live”
(not “love”) is the only viable choice, since he does not feel compelled to editorialize. (Stevenson, Johnson and Grant, and
Ostriker all select “love” over “live,” probably following Keynes and Erdman.)</p>
<p>Bentley’s decision is
singular and demands scrutiny. Although I am not an expert in manuscript
interpretation or in Blake’s handwriting, I offer a few observations. The choice between “live” and “love” comes down
to deciding whether Blake uses an “i” or an “o” (illus. 6). <a name="illus6" id="illus6"></a>

</div>
There does not appear to be a superscript dot over the
vowel, as one would expect with an “i,” which might favor “o” and Keynes’s
and Erdman’s
“love.” However, Blake’s
punctuation is, as one might expect, inconclusive. For example, although a dot appears over the “i”
in “birth” and “King/Thing,” there is no dot in
“presided,” “Said,” “Little,” “Mirth,” and “without” (see <a href="#illus1">illus. 1</a>). On the other hand, supporting Bentley’s
choice of “live,” the vowel does not appear to be a closed loop or even a semi-closed
loop, whereas “o” is written in either a completely or mostly closed
loop in almost all other words in the poem, including “oer,” “formd,”
“of” (written over “for”), “Joy,” “Go,” “of” (again), and “on.”
<p>The lone exception, “without” (<a href="#illus1">illus. 1</a>), is 
potentially crucial for two reasons. First, the descending stroke of the
 undotted “i” resembles the cursive shape of the descending stroke of 
the vowel in question in “live/love,” supporting Bentley.  Second, 
however, the “o” is more open than any other “o” in the poem, supporting
 Keynes and Erdman. This may be especially relevant, as the cursive 
shape of the “ou” in “without” could approximate the “ov” in “love,” 
although the “o” is less open and more fully articulated than the “i/o” 
in “live/love.” Moreover, other instances of “without” in the Notebook 
vary from the fairly open example in “You dont believe …” (Erdman, <em>Notebook</em>
 N21: Poem 143, line 9; E 501)—which resembles the “without” of “The 
Angel that presided”—to an unambiguously close-looped “without” in <em>A Vision of the Last Judgment</em> (Erdman, <em>Notebook</em>
 N83: 24, line 4; E 560), whose “o” does not resemble the “o” in “The 
Angel that presided.” Thus, “without” does not provide conclusive 
comparative evidence as to the issue of “live” versus “love.”  In 
addition, and trying to be both fair-minded and comprehensive, I note 
that <span class="notecall">of the approximately fifty-seven
instances of a decipherable word containing an “o” on page 32 of the Notebook, the vast majority—as many as
fifty-three—have a closed or mostly closed “o.”</span><span class="sidenote">I
 say “approximately fifty-seven” instances for the following
reasons. Blake crossed out many words on this manuscript page, and 
others are
illegible; some of these contain the letter “o.” I do not include any of
these words; thus, there is some noise in the data. Nevertheless, the 
tally does suggest that, at least on p. 32, when Blake writes an
“o” he commonly does so in a closed or mostly closed shape.</span> <span class="notecall"> However, the “o” in “to” from Poem
158 (“These Verses,” line 2: “to Michael Angelo”; E 512) presents an important
exception; it resembles the “o” of the word in question in “The Angel that
presided” and shares the same “v”- or “u”-shaped quality, although this “o” is
not followed by another stroke/letter (illus. 7).</span><span class="sidenote">The “to” in Poem 99 (“Florentine Ingratitude,” line 1; E 511) and
the initial “o” in “fool” (line 3) are open, although less obviously so than
the “to” in Poem 158 (“These Verses”).</span> <a name="illus7" id="illus7"></a>

</div>
<p><span class="notecall">More broadly, in the eleven instances throughout
the Notebook where Blake uses “live,”
the specific formation of the letter “i” and the overall cursive shape of the
word more closely resemble the letter and word in question in “The Angel

the word.</span><span class="sidenote">My methodology was to generate a list for “live” and “love” from

There may be
some minor discrepancies in the total number generated for each word

Finally, as is the case with the “o”s on page 32, the majority of
the thirty-eight instances of “love” contain an “o” that is completely 
or mostly closed. Thus, it appears that Bentley’s “live” has as much
legitimacy as Keynes’s and Erdman’s “love.” Of course, readers
are encouraged to examine the illustrations—as well as the relevant 
examples
throughout the Notebook—and draw
their own conclusions.
<p>Before I
risk any interpretive analysis, some cautionary observations are in
order. <span class="notecall">The poem’s brevity, its seemingly
ambiguous placement on the manuscript page with respect to either the central
drawing and/or the surrounding poems, even the problem of its genre—all these
factors warrant caution rather than hasty speculation.</span><span class="sidenote">For a discussion of the composition of the page, see Bentley’s footnote “Page 32: Order of Composition” (<em>Writings</em>
 2: 942). He notes that “‘The Angel …’ and ‘Sir Joshua …’ [i.e., 
“Florentine Ingratitude”] … were written in the same large hand and 
brownish ink respectively above and below the central pencil sketch” and
 that “These
Verses” was inserted later, “in the last clearly free space above the 
design and below ‘The Angel ….’”<br>
This pencil sketch is
almost exactly the same (in reverse) as the pl. 6 illustration from <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em>.
 While the discussion is beyond the scope of this essay, based on the 
two mirrored drawings, I suggest that a connection exists between “The 
Angel that presided” and <em>Visions</em> in terms of the struggle for 
individual self-expression (exemplified in the “Little creature” and 
Oothoon) in the face of repressive opposition (as seen in the forces of 
“Thing/King,” the rapacious violence of Bromion, and consuming jealousy 
of Theotormon).</span> For example, Erdman catalogues the poem
under “Satiric Verses and Epigrams,” and “The Angel that presided” certainly
seems epigrammatic. But is it satiric? Should it be regarded as one of Blake’s “angry epigrams” (Johnson and
Grant 379n)? Finally, Erdman dates
the poem between October 1807 and May 1809, which places it years later than its
most logical companion poems, <em>Songs of Innocence
and of Experience</em>. Can “The Angel that presided” (c.
1807-09) shed light on <em>Songs of Innocence</em> (1789) and <em>Songs of Experience</em> (1794)
or provide a context by which to appreciate more fully Blake’s complex
relationship with his deceased brother Robert, as suggested below?</p>
<p>Blake’s
revisions, both those agreed upon and in question, imply an authorial
indecision as to the poem’s meaning, most dramatically evidenced in Blake’s interrogation
of the original “Thing” and probable decision that “King” is more
appropriate. The consequences of his
contemplating such a change produce internal reverberations throughout the poem. Hence, the competing drafts reconstruct
the evolution of Blake’s decision-making process in articulating to himself the
poem’s meaning and record his conflicting assessments as to where to locate
the poem within his poetic vision.</p>
<p>Specific,
non-controversial aspects of Blake’s first draft bear commentary. His only use of “presided” (or its
cognate) occurs in this poem (Erdman, <em>Concordance</em> 2: 1474). Literally meaning “to
sit before,” “preside” suggests that the angel serves as witness, guardian, and
authority (i.e., “president”) (see <em>OED</em>, “preside,” etymology and def. 1). Thus, although Blake begins the poem with the guardian-angel
motif, “a familiar image in eighteenth-century hymns” that he
satirizes in the <em>Songs</em> (Lincoln 186),
he is probably not being satirical in this instance. In addition, the “Little creature” of the original draft
resists an explicitly anthropomorphic interpretation and could equally refer
to the two-day-old infant of “Infant Joy” or to the “Little Lamb.” The undifferentiated “any Thing on
Earth” also supports a more generalized interpretation of “Little creature.”
These factors suggest that Blake had in mind the more nascent and
integrated state of innocence when initially composing the poem.</p>
<p>To focus now on revisions that editors have not questioned, Blake’s 
replacement of “thou art formd for
Mirth” with “formd of Joy &amp; Mirth” signals a shift in thinking
away from defining and limiting the little creature’s purpose in life in
favor of elaborating upon its genesis, which logically refers back to 
its “birth.” Blake’s first revision, read metaphorically, identifies the
 little creature’s parents—its two ontological essences—as “Joy” and
“Mirth.” Born of such a lineage,
the creature should, naturally as it were, “Go love/live” and not need
(or actively resist) the “help” of “any Thing on Earth,” since a higher
authority has already been established at its birth. These initial 
revisions
suggest that Blake originally conceived of “The Angel that presided” as a
rather static descriptive sketch representing a “Little creature” in a 
state of
innocence, but subsequently revised the poem to emphasize the 
interconnections among
the creature’s symbolic parentage, the moment of its entry into the 
world,
and its lifelong moral imperative to “Go love/live.”</p>
<p>More broadly, the revised poem establishes
a binary opposition between “The Angel” and “any Thing on Earth,” the 
two forces
vying to shape the little creature’s life. In this initially revised 
version, however, “any Thing on
Earth” risks becoming an empty signifier, abstracted into a limitless 
number of
possible vague and amorphous referents. As a consequence, “Thing” and 
“Earth”
almost elide into a single entity, and Earth is portrayed as in conflict
 with
both the angel and the little creature, and hence is restricted to 
relatively
sinister connotations. Within this
textual fabric, “help” is in danger of losing its ironic force. Thus the
 poem breaks down. The little creature cannot fulfill
the angel’s mandate to “Go love [live] without the help of any Thing
on Earth,” since the poem’s rhetoric unintentionally prohibits the
creature’s interaction with the world at large, which the mandate “Go 
love/live” requires. For example,
Thel’s exploratory dialogues with the Lilly, the Cloud, and the Clod of 
Clay run counter to the angel’s caution. Blake’s sensitivity to these 
complications may have prompted his further
revision of the poem.</p>
<p>The hypothetical final revision of “Thing” to “King” (endorsed by Erdman and
Bentley) resolves these textual conflicts and provides coherence within the
poem’s fabric. No longer an
indeterminate “any Thing on Earth,” the revised “King” suggests, even anticipates,
that political and, by extension, social constructs of authority and power will
challenge the little creature in fulfilling both the angel’s directive and
its ethical birthright. Receiving
“help” from such sources is now unambiguously and forcefully ironic. In this version, the cautionary nature
of the angel’s directive is clear, not confused, as we recognize that the little
creature will need to be vigilant in resisting all forms of such “help” in its
efforts to fulfill its life’s purpose. Furthermore, Blake’s initial revision distinguishing between “formd for
Mirth” and “formd of Joy &amp; Mirth” now becomes crucial and clarifies that the
little creature will participate (love/live) in the world in a mutually reciprocal
manner. Born of “Joy &amp; Mirth,”
it will “Go love/live” and the recipients of its affections will respond in
kind. Finally, “King” suggests that
Blake now conceives of the little creature as anthropomorphic, but still retaining
its universal qualities as an every-child. Now, “Earth” is represented positively,
as an environment promoting regenerative love and as a fecund world ready to
facilitate the angel’s imperative; it is clearly distinguished from “King” and his
social corruptions.</p>
<p>“The
Angel that presided” juxtaposes “Angel” and “King” in what is, for Blake, a
surprisingly adversarial manner. “King” suggests a political reading that takes
readers close to the world of “London,” its “blood down Palace walls,” and even
Blake’s celebrated caricature of George III in <em>Europe a Prophecy</em>. The orthodoxy, repression, and requisite satire
associated with “King” remain, but “Angel” carries none of Blake’s typical associations
of conventional religion and pious morality, as satirized in <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>. Rather, as Hazard Adams suggests, this angel
is “a Reprobate angel who reminds the child that all responsibility and power
reside in him [i.e., the child]” (436); hence, the angel is purposefully unconventional.</p>
<p>Thus,
the angel of the final version of the poem comes very close to Blake’s
personal and complex understanding of angels, either guardian or guiding, as recorded,
for example, in his letters to William Hayley (6 May 1800) and Thomas Butts (22
November 1802) (E 705, 720-23). Blake’s letter to
Hayley is especially relevant, as he responds to the death of Hayley’s only son,
Thomas Alphonso, and reminisces about the death of his brother Robert in
February 1787: “Thirteen years ago. I lost a brother &amp; with his spirit I
converse daily &amp; hourly …. I hear his advice &amp; even now write from
his Dictate” (E 705). Blake
wrote “The Angel that presided” in the notebook that he inherited from his
brother and, significantly, he “kept the Notebook near at hand all his life,
filling it over the years …” (Erdman, <em>Notebook</em> 1). Hence, the angel does indeed
provide a lifelong dictum, if not a literal dictation, by which the little
creature is instructed to “Go love/live,” and by which William is inspired to
write (and draw). Thus, Blake fulfills the angel’s directive within (and beyond)
the memorialized space of the Notebook. Such speculation has legitimacy, since “William
thought of Robert as a fellow spirit and even as a spiritual guide” (Bentley, <em>Stranger</em> 6) and as an “‘affectionate
companion’ who shared his interests and enthusiasms” (Ackroyd 84). It would be too reductive a critical
interpretation—and one antithetical to Blake’s synthetic imagination—to suggest
that the angel represents the guiding voice of Robert exclusively directing
William, the little creature. Rather, the angel and the little creature enjoy a symbiotic and
inspirational relationship within Blake’s imaginary landscape. They can be considered “fellow spirit[s]”
or “reciprocal” images of each other, similar to the <span class="notecall">“mirror” images that Blake
produces in <em>Milton</em> (1804-c. 1811) of
“William” and “Robert” receiving “inspiration” from Milton (Bentley, <em>Stranger</em> 6, 98),</span><span class="sidenote">See <em>Milton a Poem</em> pls. 29 (“William”) and 33 (“Robert”) (objects <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=milton.c.illbk.31&amp;java=yes" target="_blank">31</a> and <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=milton.c.illbk.36&amp;java=yes" target="_blank">36</a> in copy C in the <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/" target="_blank"><em>William Blake Archive</em></a>).</span> or the “profiles of William and Robert Blake” that are “jestingly and
competitively drawn” and appear “in the last page of <em>An Island in the Moon</em> (1784)” (Erdman, <em>Notebook</em> 9).</p>
<p>Further support for this hypothesis can be found in Hayley’s October 
1801 poem, identified as “William Hayley to the Spirit of His Son” (“My 
Angel Artist in the skies”) (Keynes, <em>Letters</em> 36).  The first 
stanza serves as an instructive gloss to both “The Angel that presided” 
and Blake’s continued belief that his dead brother Robert served as an 
inspirational guide for his artistic productions. (The stanza could 
easily apply to the sometimes “eccentric” Blake and Robert’s 
“inspir[ing]” and “controul[ing]” influence.)
</p><blockquote>My Angel Artist in the skies,<br>
<span style="padding-left: 10px">Thou mayst inspirit &amp; controul</span><br>
a Failing Brother’s Hand &amp; Eyes<br>
<span style="padding-left: 10px">Or temper his eccentric Soul.</span></blockquote>
Blake was probably acquainted with this poem, given the close 
relationship between Blake and Hayley at this time. The second stanza 
specifically links Blake’s artistic productions to Hayley’s own dead 
son:
<blockquote>Now to the feeling Blake attend,<br>
<span style="padding-left: 10px">His Copies of dear Cowper view</span><br>
And make his Portraits of our Friend<br>
<span style="padding-left: 10px">Perfect in Truth as Thou art true.</span></blockquote>
<p>These biographical, textual, and material contexts shed
light on the revisions of “The Angel that presided” from its original, more sentimental
version to its final, more political version. Moreover, the editorial choice between
“love” and “live” accentuates these differences and becomes the deciding
factor, tipping the scale in favor of either a sentimental or political interpretation. </p>
<p>For example, “Go love” draws attention
to the trace elements of biography in “The Angel that presided.” Thus, while the angel’s imperative “Go
love” presupposes the shared communitarian values and holistic relationships found
in the idyllic world of <em>Innocence</em>,
these values themselves are based upon the kind of close-knit, non-eroticized love
exemplified by “favourite” brothers (Bentley, <em>Stranger</em> 6) and upon the symbiotic and highly integrated
relationship of a literal brotherly love. “Go love” also emphasizes serving “the other” and not empowering “the
self.” Brotherly love, either real
or idealized, provides a rationale for restraining, or domesticating, the fiercely
independent vision and exacting moral code commonly associated with Blake’s
character and writings, since “Man liveth not by Self alone but in his brothers
face” (<em>The Four Zoas</em> p. 133, line
25; E 402). Limiting one’s will
to power out of respect or compassion for another must inevitably occur for one
to participate, imaginatively, in the prelapsarian world of the little creature or in the
landscape of <em>Innocence</em>. From another perspective, “Go love” stresses
that the nurturing, even regenerative responsibilities implied in the angel’s
charge are born of the little creature’s symbolic parents, “Joy
&amp; Mirth,” and not imposed by “any King,” which certainly squares well with
Blake’s dissenter upbringing (Bentley, <em>Stranger</em> 7; Ackroyd 17, 18). “Go love” also
suggests that the “help” offered by “any King” be understood more as an
interpersonal betrayal by the civic father-figure than as a political offense
against the corporate body politic. In this version, the celestial angel may have difficulty moving beyond
merely presiding over the little creature’s moment of birth as it moves into
the world to fulfill the angel’s mandate, and the baptismal-like power of “Go
love” may diminish as the creature develops into adulthood.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the 
imperative “Go live” compels the little creature into the experiential world
of action, consequence, and personal development, and away from the secure, but
ultimately static, worlds of innocence and brotherly love. For Blake, the directive “Go live”
implies an unwavering commitment to one’s personal vision and acting
accordingly, regardless of the consequences. Under such conditions, “Go live” inevitably conflicts with either
the initial “any Thing” or the revised “any King.” In the first version, “any Thing” may refer, obliquely, to
the kind of well-intended, if misguided, physical punishment that Blake experienced
as a child (as a little creature) when he confided to his
“affectionate” and “sympathetic” but “concerned” parents about his recurring
visions of angels (Bentley, <em>Stranger</em> 3,
5, 19-21). These “thrashing[s]” appear
to have been infrequent, although one source notes that “his father … severely
whipped him several times” on account of his visions (Samuel Palmer, quoted in Bentley, <em>Blake Records</em> 10). Whatever their duration or intensity, for Blake they “became
a source of perpetual discontent” (Ackroyd 21). Blake may have felt uncomfortable expressing these
ambivalences directly in a poem that champions a “reprobate” angel and his
directive, and therefore used the generic “Thing” to oppose the visionary
angel, only to revise (and suppress) “Thing” for “King” later. Thus, he transforms a painful
reminiscence linking his honest accounts of his visions of angels with a rare
instance of parental censorship into a metaphoric, public statement about “any King.” Under these pressures, “any King” broadens
to include any repressive governing, legislative, or moral authority—any
oppressor, kingly or otherwise.</p>
<p>The political implications of “Go live” and “any
King” are clarified by reference to
Blake’s similar phrase, “So spoke an Angel at my birth,” from the unfinished Notebook poem “Now Art has lost its
mental Charms” (Erdman, <em>Notebook</em> N79; E 479). “Now Art has lost” creates a
decidedly real-world context in which the angel fears that
“France shall subdue the World in Arms.” This angel’s mandate compels the persona (who, in “Descend[ing] …
upon Earth,” presumably matures into an adult) to “Renew the Arts on Britains
Shore” so that “works of Art” will “meet” (that is, conquer) “Armies” and
“War.” Significantly, however, and
with a typical Blakean twist, if “thy Nation” (i.e., Britain) refuses the “Arts,” then
“France shall the arts of Peace restore” and “save thee from the Ungrateful
shore” of Britain. Thus, artistic
production transcends political allegiances, national boundaries, and
military might. The similarity of
the two phrases creates a symbolic, perhaps even evolutionary, relationship
between the little creature and his angel’s mandate to “Go live without the
help of any King on Earth” and the unnamed adult figure in “Now Art has lost,”
who fulfills the implied trajectory of the first angel’s directive to “Go live”
by realizing the second angel’s imperative to “Descend … upon Earth” and
become an artist opposing political strife, war, and “any King” through artistic production.</p>
<p>Finally, “The Angel that presided” and “Now
Art has lost” stress the importance of the explicit audience’s 
commitment to realize
the angel’s otherworldly directive through the real-world action of 
embracing one’s
independent vision and corresponding call to artistic production. Within
 the specific context of vision
and vocation, Blake’s letter to Hayley suggests that his memory of 
Robert
and Robert’s “Dictate” continually guide him in his past and future 
artistic creations. In fact, Robert continues to inform Blake’s
artistic consciousness as late as the 1811 and 1818 printings of <em>Milton</em>.
 Thus, “The Angel that presided” can perhaps best be understood
as a timeless metatextual promise that Blake makes to himself through 
the
reciprocal, mirrored image of a guiding angel-brother and his “Dictate.”
 In this context, the angel’s spoken imperative to “Go love/live” serves
 not only as an example of Blake’s commitment
to memorialize Robert, but also as a self-confirming validation of his 
previous
creative work and his dedication to a personal vision. Importantly, the 
angel’s
directive also functions as Blake’s pledge to remain vigilant in 
fulfilling these
promises through future artistic efforts and in spite of the intrusions 
of kingly
authorities, thus placing Blake in much the same position as the little
creature.</p>
<p>In conclusion, “The Angel that
presided” illustrates in a succinct, and therefore manageable, way the
difficult issues confronting editors in transcribing Blake’s manuscripts
 and in making informed, but sometimes conflicting, decisions. These 
decisions, in turn, define and shape the interpretive
possibilities open to a given text, as demonstrated in the alternative 
readings
produced by “Thing” versus “King” and especially “love” and “live.” 
Within this more interpretive perspective,
“The Angel that presided” serves as a concise personal manifesto for 
Blake,
providing him with a lifelong directive to “Go love/live” by opposing 
“any
King” through artistic production; it also attests to the importance of 
guiding
angels and their spoken “Dictate” in Blake’s imaginative landscape. 
Moreover, the poem highlights the
importance of the Notebook as a talismanic metonym for Robert and as a
memorialized space providing continual inspiration for Blake’s various 
creative
experiments. The poem illustrates
how his artistic creations can be understood as ongoing collaborations
between “fellow spirit[s]” with, at times, William transcribing, as it 
were, Robert’s
guiding “Dictate,” almost literalizing Blake’s claim that “even in this 
world by
it I am the companion of Angels” (letter to Hayley, 6 May 1800; E 705). 
The nuances implied in “The Angel that presided o’er my birth” extend 
our knowledge of Blake’s complex, idiosyncratic, and visionary
understanding of angels and their influence on his imaginative world. 
Finally, it is a testament to the power
of this short poem that, so many years later, it helped inspire Vonnegut
 to transform
his own personal tragedy and loss into a lifelong credo opposing “any 
Thing” (or “any King”)
