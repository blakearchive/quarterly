        <div class="text">
        <p>This book is more about the social function of Blake’s art in
 a number of physical and personal economies than it is about the art 
itself. Haggarty examines the idea of the gift as well as related ideas 
about spiritual exchange in selected passages from a few poems—mostly <em>Jerusalem</em> and <em>Milton</em>—but
 the predominant focus remains the social network of Blake’s friends and
 patrons and the larger cultural matrix that governed the etiquette of 
giving in the eighteenth century. As such the primary texts are Blake’s 
letters, annotations, and <em>Descriptive Catalogue</em>. The secondary 
texts are myriad, though Bourdieu, Derrida, and Marcel Mauss frame the 
most significant discussions and Mee and Makdisi plug the interstices. 
In addition, a teeming hive of contemporary characters like Duff and 
Hayley, Reynolds and Robinson swarm these pages and at times push Blake 
to the margins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	Haggarty examines gift-giving in five “discursive domains” that 
ascend steadily from secular to spiritual: Economy, Patronage, Charity, 
Inspiration, and Salvation. Her contention is that gift-giving is not 
only a central preoccupation “but a quasi-formal principle” of Blake’s 
work (2). Because of his “horror of Money” (20; Crabb Robinson’s 
phrase), Blake continually tried to navigate the terrain between the 
grubby economy of business and the generosity of the gift, a generosity 
based upon forging friendships rather than setting prices, adhering to 
contracts, or exacting compensation. The paradoxes and vexations of 
Blake’s “intermingling” of these realms form the heart of this book. 
Blake’s conception of the gift underwrites “his radical critique of 
commerce, polite consensus, self-righteous morality, and Church 
doctrine” (2) and is bound closely with his views of reciprocity and 
friendship. To the bemusement and often annoyance of his patrons, 
Blake’s notion of reciprocity rested on “an exercise of co-operative 
antagonism” (3) that often threatened to strain the very ties of the 
friendship itself. In the final chapters, Haggarty looks at various 
incarnations of the divine gift—the “free gift” and “pure gift,” 
including Christ’s sacrificial offering of his life—which disrupt and 
complicate both the mercantile contract and the more personal idea of 
reciprocity.</p>
<p>	The first chapter, “Economy,” analyzes the representation of the 
gift in Blake’s letters and annotations and the transaction of his 
illuminated books in the world. Blake implies “the incommensurability of
 <em>price</em>, <em>debt</em>, and <em>money</em> with human experience,” substituting for the cash nexus his own divinely inflected discourse of “<em>treasures</em>, <em>rewards</em>, <em>gold</em>, <em>talents</em>, and <em>riches</em>”
 (12), borrowed of course from the New Testament. In this 
transfiguration “treasures” are “gifts that can be exchanged” (12). The 
unique production of Blake’s books, his “cottage economy” (Paul Mann’s 
term), and the way that individual sales along with the sharing of his 
books embody their value constitute more of a social than commercial 
form of transaction. “What is particularly interesting about Blake’s 
home-studios,” as Haggarty insightfully remarks, “is that, in them, 
places of sale are also places of production and, as it were, the work 
of consumption. The home-studio is thus, potentially at least, a site of
 unalienated exchange” (21). The chapter concludes with a fine analysis 
of the architecture and building of Golgonooza in <em>Jerusalem</em>, a passage that intermingles earthly and heavenly details in ways that attest Blake’s practical difficulty with “treasure.”</p>
<p>	Exploring the historical role of patronage in a transitional time 
and Blake’s experiences with this institution, the second chapter is the
 most informative and strongest of the book. Haggarty demonstrates that 
patronage was changing in the late eighteenth century, becoming 
increasingly, in Dustin Griffin’s phrase, “a site of contestation” (46) 
that involved overlapping economies of aristocratic and commercial 
culture. In some ways Blake was a throwback to the past in that from the
 turn of the century until his death he became almost entirely dependent
 for his income on three patrons—Hayley, Butts, and Linnell. On the 
other hand, he worked hard to guarantee that these were not exclusively 
business partnerships, that he did not compromise his artistic freedom 
in these relationships, and that he was intent on “forging, rather than 
breaking, the bonds between men” (51). This tightrope act could be 
challenging, however, particularly since Blake based so many of his 
friendships on the proverb “Opposition is true Friendship.” Haggarty 
usefully reveals how Blake negotiated such difficulties in her depiction
 of his wily dedication to the Countess of Egremont (1808), in which he 
fashions a <em>recusatio</em> that nimbly pirouettes between praise and pride (58-59).</p>
<p>	Haggarty outlines the differences between Derrida and Mauss in their
 understanding of the gift’s relation to gratitude and suggests that 
Blake shares more of an affinity with Mauss’s notion of a gift “at once 
free and obligatory” (63). She then applies these ideas to a discussion 
of Blake’s volatile relationship with William Hayley and his circle. 
Blake plays the game of patronage through subtle expressions of 
gratitude in his letters, yet his numerous “eruption[s] of feeling” (72)
 and “small acts of resistance” (73) indicate that he was “subtly 
contesting the terms of his relationship with Hayley” (72). Blake’s 
defiance and indignation at the drudgery of Hayley’s projects ultimately
 doomed the relationship, and he broke with his patron in 1805-06. He 
could no longer sustain the paradox of being Hayley’s “devoted rebel” 
(71). As Haggarty frankly admits, though Blake improvised various forms 
of reciprocity and friendship with his patrons, he was never entirely 
successful at communicating the idea of a gift as both open and 
obligatory—at intertwining friendship and finance or responding promptly
 with appropriate expressions of gratitude —and often wound up 
qualifying his ideals of “co-operative antagonism” (83) and artistic 
freedom.</p>
<p>	Blake’s understanding of charity, shown in his annotations to Thornton’s <em>Lord’s Prayer, Newly Translated</em> (1827) and in passages from <em>Milton</em> and <em>Jerusalem</em>,
 partly subscribes to, partly resists the constructions of charity in 
contemporary writings on religion and political economy. He opposes “the
 purification of the gift” (86) and hints that the free gift is always 
attached to the economist logic it means to refute. Haggarty examines 
Blake’s critique of the free gift in the context of writings on the 
voluntarism of almsgiving by Burke, Malthus, Copleston, and Chalmers. 
From the problems associated with charity and the free gift, she moves 
to Blake’s theory of inspiration, a genuinely pure spiritual gift with 
no quid pro quo but a curious relationship with temporal boundaries: “It
 disrupts time’s homogenous flow[,] … resists the division and 
supervision of labor under industrial capitalism. But it also refuses to
 break with the temporal cycle altogether. Inspiration’s ‘Non Existent’ 
time seems … [to be] the generous present of the ‘Moment’ in <em>Milton</em>”
 (113). In both later epics, inspiration defies measure, though it is 
never divorced from labor as many of Blake’s contemporaries believed. 
“Rather, inspiration and labor arrive together, in the time of the 
generous present” (114).&nbsp;</p>
<p>	Haggarty then considers the disparity that H. C. Robinson and others
 pointed out between Blake’s claims to divine inspiration and his 
working methods, particularly his attention to copying. She argues that 
Blake differentiated between a “seeming” copy and a “real” one and 
maintains that the latter is more truly like its source (127).&nbsp; 
More compellingly, she claims that in his <em>Descriptive Catalogue</em>,
 Blake proposed that visionary copying was unmediated and that 
“emulating rather than imitating these originals” was the pathway to 
genius (129). The balance of the chapter weighs various contradictory 
definitions of inspiration in Blake’s writings, setting them against 
those of figures such as Plato and Reynolds and arguing, among other 
things, that the artist may as readily be “empowered as … dispossessed 
by [inspiration’s] eruption” (131). For Blake, inspiration was not 
passive, required the reciprocity of labor, and “was as much human as it
 was divine” (142). That it could just as easily destabilize or 
interrupt the continuity of a work is made clear in plate 3 of <em>Jerusalem</em>,
 where, as Haggarty notes, entire passages are “gouged out” (Paley’s 
words) or painted over and prominent gaps propel the poem “into ever 
increasing discontinuity” (152). Here is evidence of a gift that cannot 
be realized in human space or time.</p>
<p>	The final chapter, “Salvation,” investigates Blake’s unorthodox 
representation of Christ’s “saving gift” (157), his sacrifice of himself
 for Albion in <em>Jerusalem</em>.&nbsp; Haggarty shows how the Bible 
and later writings link the doctrine of salvation to sacrifice; how 
Blake critiques such figurations in his portrait of a God who manifests 
himself through the incarnate Christ in <em>The Book of Urizen</em>; how
 Blake sees Christ’s sacrifice as an example that humankind has the 
capacity to imitate; and how the image of Christ’s crucifixion and 
Albion’s response on plate 76 of <em>Jerusalem</em> both encapsulate and
 extend these ideas. Her visual analysis of this plate is instructive, 
revealing that in Blake’s image of Christ “it is almost as if the 
archetype is now in some sense paler than its copy [Albion]” (182).</p>
<p>A brief conclusion reflects further on at least two aspects of 
Blake’s conception of the gift that frustrate any tidy thesis—his 
ruptures with friends and patrons and his erasure of passages from the 
third plate of <em>Jerusalem</em> that imply a close relationship with the reader.</p>
<p>	In a book that offers such subtle analyses of the complex systems of
 social and economic transaction surrounding Blake’s concept of the 
gift, it would have been helpful to see clear transitional bridges 
between chapters and a consistent evolution of the argument. It requires
 a good deal of patience to identify the trajectory of the thesis and 
follow its permutations. Too often the chapters read like discrete 
essays that plunge us into thickets of dense theoretical matter without a
 machete or the author’s megaphone. So much of the material here is 
quoted, so many ideas overlap, that often one has a hard time discerning
 the source of an insight (is it Mann or Mauss?). In place of a direct 
payoff from the amassing of evidence stand lengthy cited passages. It’s 
true that Haggarty eventually qualifies or modifies most views expressed
 by cultural or literary theorists, but the reader has to work very hard
 to unearth these interventions. One casualty of the book’s format is 
Blake himself, who often bows to Bourdieu or Derrida and whose poetic 
texts emerge tentatively at the ends of chapters. The brief close 
readings of passages and plates are valuable, but they leave us 
hankering for more commentary, especially on the designs. In the end 
perhaps only the veteran Blake scholar will find wisdom along this 
book’s perilous path. The rest of us, like Rintrah, shall roar and shake
 our fires in the burdened air.</p>
