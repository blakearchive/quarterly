                <p>Scheduled for imminent (I hope) publication: <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of
Experience:</hi> Twentieth Century Interpretations (Prentice-Hall), ed. M. D. Paley. It includes an
introductory essay, six reprinted essays or chapters, and seven excerpts. The longer items are: Alicia
Ostriker’s chapter on the prosody of the <hi rend="i">Songs</hi>, Foster Damon’s “The Initial Eden,” “The
Vision of Innocence” by Martin Price [from <hi rend="i">To the Palace of Wisdon</hi>], “Infinite London” by
David Erdman, “Blake’s Introduction to Experience” by Northrop Frye, and “Tyger of Wrath” by myself. The
Erdman article, from <hi rend="i">Blake: Prophet</hi>, has been revised by the author; my own piece
incorporates some minor corrections and emendations. The short excerpts vary from 1 to 4 pages in length and
are mostly on individual poems; they are from books by Joseph H. Wicksteed, Robert F. Gleckner, Harold Bloom,
Mark Schorer, Hazard Adams, and E. D. Hirsch, Jr., and from an article by Martin K. Nurmi. As I suppose is
inevitable in such undertakings, I wished I had scope for at least several other articles. However, I had to
be mindful of length, and also of the publisher’s wish not of include articles in two previously published
Blake collections. (An exception was made for the Frye essay, which I considered indispensable to such a
volume). I hope the resulting book will be useful to students.</p>
