	<meta name="DC.Description" xml:lang="en" content="A splendid publication by the William Blake Trust features reproductions of Blake&amp;rsquo;s nineteen watercolors illustrating Robert Blair&amp;rsquo;s  The Grave , rediscovered in 2001, and texts by Martin Butlin and Morton D. Paley. These drawings, plus  Prone on the Lonely Grave&amp;mdash;She Drops , which was once part of the group, were executed by Blake in the fall of 1805 on commission from Robert Hartley Cromek, whose edition of the poem with Blake&amp;rsquo;s illustrations, engraved by Louis Schiavonetti, appeared in 1808. Butlin&amp;rsquo;s contributions to the volume extend to a consideration of related drawings, including  Death Pursuing the Soul through the Avenues of Life . He states that this work &amp;ldquo;stands out from the finished watercolours in that it is a monochrome drawing, finished in sepia washes over pencil on card in a rather heavy manner uncharacteristic of Blake&amp;rsquo;s own hand; although the invention seems to be by the artist [Blake], the work is perhaps a pencil drawing gone over by someone else to make it more saleable in the later 19th century.&amp;rdquo; A long footnote includes the following comments:  When this drawing was first brought to my attention in 1965 I accepted it on the basis of a reproduction but suggested, in a letter to Sir Geoffrey Keynes of 13 December 1965, that it had perhaps been gone over in parts by someone else. By the time it was acquired by Essick in 1971 I had been able to see it and was satisfied that it was a perfectly good work by Blake and it was included without qualification in my catalogue in 1981. However, constant brooding over reproductions of this work has led me to my present doubts.  Not surprisingly, these statements immediately caught my attention. In 1965 Butlin apparently believed that  Death Pursuing  had been &amp;ldquo;gone over&amp;rdquo; only &amp;ldquo;in parts by someone else,&amp;rdquo; but his statement in 2009 that it is &amp;ldquo;a pencil drawing&amp;rdquo; from Blake&amp;rsquo;s hand suggests that he now believes that all the washes were added by &amp;ldquo;someone else.&amp;rdquo; While I am tempted to do some teary-eyed &amp;ldquo;brooding&amp;rdquo; myself over Butlin&amp;rsquo;s partial deattribution of what I had long considered one of the more delicious examples of neo-gothic horror in my collection, his comments raise more general issues about how drawings are attributed, how the scholar/connoisseur converts subjective responses into convincing propositions, and how reproductions can play a role in those endeavors.">

      <td class="body">A splendid publication by the William Blake Trust
 features reproductions of Blake’s nineteen watercolors illustrating 
Robert Blair’s <em>The Grave</em>, rediscovered in 2001, and texts by Martin Butlin and Morton D. Paley.&nbsp;<a href="#fn1" name="fr1" id="fr1">[1]</a> These drawings, plus <em>Prone on the Lonely Grave—She Drops</em>,
 which was once part of the group, were executed by Blake in the fall of
 1805 on commission from Robert Hartley Cromek, whose edition of the 
poem with Blake’s illustrations, engraved by Louis Schiavonetti, 
appeared in 1808. Butlin’s contributions to the volume extend to a 
consideration of related drawings, including <em>Death Pursuing the Soul through the Avenues of Life</em> (<a href="45.2.essickone" target="_blank">illus. 1</a>).
 He states that this work “stands out from the finished watercolours in 
that it is a monochrome drawing, finished in sepia washes over pencil on
 card in a rather heavy manner uncharacteristic of Blake’s own hand; 
although the invention seems to be by the artist [Blake], the work is 
perhaps a pencil drawing gone over by someone else to make it more 
saleable in the later 19th century.” A long footnote includes the 
following comments:
<blockquote>When this drawing was first brought to my attention in 1965 I
 accepted it on the basis of a reproduction but suggested, in a letter 
to Sir Geoffrey Keynes of 13 December 1965, that it had perhaps been 
gone over in parts by someone else. By the time it was acquired by 
Essick in 1971 I had been able to see it and was satisfied that it was a
 perfectly good work by Blake and it was included without qualification 
in my catalogue in 1981. However, constant brooding over reproductions 
of this work has led me to my present doubts.</blockquote>
Not surprisingly, these statements immediately caught my attention. In 1965 Butlin apparently believed that <em>Death Pursuing</em>
 had been “gone over” only “in parts by someone else,” but his statement
 in 2009 that it is “a pencil drawing” from Blake’s hand suggests that 
he now believes that all the washes were added by “someone else.” While I
 am tempted to do some teary-eyed “brooding” myself over Butlin’s 
partial deattribution of what I had long considered one of the more 
delicious examples of neo-gothic horror in my collection, his comments 
raise more general issues about how drawings are attributed, how the 
scholar/connoisseur converts subjective responses into convincing 
propositions, and how reproductions can play a role in those endeavors.</td>

      <td class="body">The basis for Butlin’s change of mind would have 
confounded an earlier generation of art historians. For purposes of 
attribution, confrontation with the original work of art was not only 
essential but definitive. The use of reproductions of any sort was 
eschewed; as late as the 1960s, many art historians still refused to use
 color reproductions because they were thought inevitably to be 
misleading. Such attitudes require revision in light of recent 
developments in high-resolution digital imaging. I believe that digital 
reproductions of sufficient quality can indeed be the basis for the 
attribution (or deattribution) of two-dimensional works of art, even 
after studying the original, in just the manner that Butlin describes. 
But what sorts of “reproductions” was he brooding over?</td>

      <td class="body">I first saw <em>Death Pursuing</em> at Charles 
Sessler, Inc., a famous bookshop in Philadelphia, in the summer of 1971.
 Mabel Zahn, Sessler’s employee of many years who oversaw prints and 
drawings, told me that she had been corresponding with Ruthven Todd 
about the work, and that Todd had in turn told Butlin about it. In a 
letter to me of 19 August 1971, Zahn stated that she had sent Todd a 
“photostatic copy” of <em>Death Pursuing</em>. This was apparently in 
the previous year, for in a letter of 1 December 1970 from Todd to Zahn,
 he indicates that he had seen some sort of reproduction but also 
remarks “if you have the drawing photographed, I’d really appreciate a 
copy.” Todd’s letter begins with the forceful statement that “I find 
that Martin Butlin agrees with me that Mrs. Holmes’s Blake [<em>Death Pursuing</em> was then in her collection] is indeed a genuine, if perfectly horrible and disgusting, piece of his work.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn2" name="fr2" id="fr2">[2]</a>
 Apparently these opinions were based on the “photostatic” copy, a term 
that could refer to any number of photographic or electrostatic 
reproductions.&nbsp;<a href="#fn3" name="fr3" id="fr3">[3]</a> This apparently was not a conventional photograph, given Todd’s request for one “if you have the drawing photographed.”</td>

      <td class="body">The later history of reproductions of <em>Death Pursuing</em>
 is equally unprepossessing. I know of only a few prior to the Blake 
Trust volume of 2009, all in black and white except for a much reduced 
color illustration on page 16 in Sotheby’s New York catalogue of 2 May 
2006 offering the nineteen <em>Grave</em> watercolors for sale. 
Unfortunately, Sotheby’s illustration shifts the lighter tones toward a 
muddy brown. To create a far better reproduction, I asked John Sullivan,
 head of imaging services at the Huntington Library, to produce a series
 of high-resolution images, including details of selected features. He 
used a Phase One P 45+ imaging back mounted on a Hasselblad camera. The 
digital file for the complete design is a 72.2 MB TIFF with dimensions 
of 6527 x 3853 pixels. At true size (that is, the size of the original) 
this yields a 645ppi image. The file of the complete image permits areas
 as small as 25 x 16 mm. in the original to be enlarged to a monitor 
image of 46.5 x 27.5 cm. without pixelation. Detail shots of the steps, 
the winged figure’s torso and face, and the female’s neck and hair allow
 for magnification approximately four times greater than enlargements 
based on the digital file of the full image. In early 2009, I sent a DVD
 of the file of the complete design to John Commander, executive 
director of the Blake Trust, for reproduction in the trust’s <em>Grave</em> publication. I believe that this digital image is the basis for the reduced (16.5 x 7.7 cm.) color illustration on page 24.</td>

      <td class="body">A few guidelines can now be drawn. Basing 
attributions on reproductions is a dicey game. It is always helpful to 
know which have been consulted. Among the several reproductions of <em>Death Pursuing</em>,
 only the digital images described above are in my view sufficient for 
questioning an attribution previously made upon viewing the original 
work. I hope that Butlin was shown the digital file I sent to the Blake 
Trust and that his opinions are based, at least in part, upon it rather 
than the inferior reproductions available between 1970 and 2008.</td>

      <td class="body">Although the online reproductions accompanying 
this essay do not have the resolution of the TIFFs, they should be 
capable of confirming (or questioning) the observations about many of 
the details in <em>Death Pursuing</em> presented here. The 300ppi enlargements of the twenty <em>Grave</em> watercolors available in the <em>William Blake Archive</em> &lt;﻿<a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/" target="_blank">http://www.blakearchive.org</a>﻿&gt; permit close study of those related works.</td>

      <td class="body">The high-resolution TIFFs greatly assist investigation of <em>Death Pursuing</em>.
 In several respects, they are superior to using a magnifying glass to 
look at the original. The field of vision is much larger, particularly 
compared to lens magnifications above the power of five. Zooming in and 
out and panning across the entire work are smoother and easier. Although
 I have been looking at the original drawing on and off for forty years,
 I did not notice several salient features until I studied the TIFFs 
side by side with the original.&nbsp;<a href="#fn4" name="fr4" id="fr4">[4]</a> What I found leads me to some perceptions that differ from Butlin’s.</td>

      <td class="paranumber">8</td>
      <td class="body">In the Blake Trust volume, Butlin calls <em>Death Pursuing</em>
 a “monochrome drawing” in “sepia” washes “on card”; these are among the
 reasons that it “stands out from the finished watercolours.” Sepia 
means a brown tone, although I find that art historians sometimes use it
 in reference to the sort of gray and black washes that dominate <em>Death Pursuing</em>.
 There are, however, at least two other colors in the drawing. The most 
easily perceived is a patch of blue on the right lower chest of the 
winged figure (Death), just above and to the right of his right lower 
thigh (<a href="45.2.essickthree" target="_blank">illus. 3</a>).
 Other, thinner blue washes also highlight his right knee, his right 
upper arm, his beard and hair (note particularly the area just right of 
his mouth, <a href="45.2.essickfour" target="_blank">illus. 4</a>), a triangular section of the wing just above his left shoulder (<a href="45.2.essickthree" target="_blank">illus. 3</a>), wing segments right of his left arm (<a href="45.2.essicktwo" target="_blank">illus. 2</a>), two small ovoid patches above and to the right of the flames (presumably of a torch) covering Death’s left hand (<a href="45.2.essicktwo" target="_blank">illus. 2</a>), two dark areas below his lower left leg that lie between the shafts of light emanating from the flames (<a href="45.2.essicktwo" target="_blank">illus. 2</a>), and (very thinly applied) the three step risers (<a href="45.2.essicktwo" target="_blank">illus. 2</a>)
 below Death and the step left of and below the right foot of the female
 figure (the Soul). Some of these blue areas have a slightly greenish 
appearance and may be either a diluted version of the blue on Death’s 
chest or a different color. The two brown spots on Death’s face (<a href="45.2.essickfour" target="_blank">illus. 4</a>),
 one on his beard below his mouth and one above his right eye, are 
stains unrelated to the purposeful coloring. The most interesting color 
touches are the (six?) fine red lines, each only about 1 mm. long, on 
the back of the Soul’s neck (<a href="45.2.essickfive" target="_blank">illus. 5</a>).
 These suggest that Death had grasped his victim around her neck, 
leaving bloody marks behind, and has just thrown her into the abyss with
 his extended right hand. Both the blue and red hues have probably faded
 over the years.</td>

 The colorist changed the position of the arch, particularly on the

      <td class="body">No one has questioned the belief (I am tempted to call it a fact) that Blake designed <em>Death Pursuing</em> in response to Cromek’s commission to illustrate <em>The Grave</em>.&nbsp;<a href="#fn7" name="fr7" id="fr7">[7]</a> R. H. Cromek’s son, Thomas Hartley Cromek, wrote the following on the back of the mount (<a href="45.2.essicksix" target="_blank">illus. 6</a>):
<pre>Illustration to “Urizen” – a poem by
William Blake – who also made this 
drawing–  It belonged to my father.
                        Thomas _ H. Cromek</pre>
The error in associating the design with Blake’s <em>Book of Urizen</em>
 may have been based on similarities between Death and some of the more 
horrific figures in that illuminated book. Allan Cunningham, in his 1830
 biography of Blake, describes several designs in <em>Urizen</em> and 
claims that one of the “exploits” of an “evil spirit” pictured in them 
is “to chase a female soul through a narrow gate and hurl her headlong 
down into a darksome pit.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn8" name="fr8" id="fr8">[8]</a> Cunningham, who lived with the Cromek family from April to the fall of 1810,&nbsp;<a href="#fn9" name="fr9" id="fr9">[9]</a> was very probably describing <em>Death Pursuing</em>. The drawing may have become dissociated from other <em>Grave</em> designs and identified with <em>Urizen</em> as early as 1810, and almost certainly by 1830. <em>Death Pursuing</em>
 probably remained in T. H. Cromek’s possession until at least 1863, for
 he appears to be referring to it when he notes in his journal that the 
copy of <em>Urizen</em> in the British Museum “does not contain the 
subject which I have by him and which I was told by Mr. Frost A.R.A. 
formed one of the illustrations.”&nbsp;<a href="#fn10" name="fr10" id="fr10">[10]</a></td>

 is listed under that title as number “11” of fifteen designs in 
Cromek’s first prospectus, dated “Nov. 1805,” for his edition of <em>The Grave</em>.&nbsp;<a href="#fn11" name="fr11" id="fr11">[11]</a>
 This, I believe, is a key document for considering the issue of 
attribution. All the other fourteen designs listed, with the possible 
exception of an untraced drawing for “A characteristic Frontispiece,” 
are known as colored drawings, or at the very least as a monochrome wash
 drawing.&nbsp;<a href="#fn12" name="fr12" id="fr12">[12]</a> If <em>Death Pursuing</em>
 came into Cromek’s hands as nothing more than a pencil drawing, it 
would have been the only design selected on the basis of a work in that 
medium alone. In spite of the outré (and for some tastes even 
“disgusting”) features of the image, Cromek may have chosen the design 
for inclusion in his first prospectus because it might appeal to the 
public taste for the gothic, but for him to have done so on the basis of
 a pencil drawing alone is surprising. It would also have been a little 
odd for Cunningham so readily to describe <em>Death Pursuing</em> as part of (rather than a preliminary for) <em>The Book of Urizen</em> if the drawing had existed only as a pencil sketch rather than a more finished design, like those in all copies of <em>Urizen</em>.</td>

      <td class="body">As I mentioned earlier, it is difficult to see much pencil drawing underlying the washes in <em>Death Pursuing</em>. Fortunately, Blake’s preliminary sketches for his <em>Grave</em>
 designs, and the under-drawing in pencil noted (but not described in 
any detail) by Butlin for seventeen of the twenty watercolors, offer 
some clues about <em>Death Pursuing</em> when it existed only as a 
pencil drawing. The visible under-drawing in the seventeen watercolors 
is not extensive, although here again we can assume that some lines are 
covered with watercolors or pen-and-ink work.&nbsp;<a href="#fn13" name="fr13" id="fr13">[13]</a> As in <em>Death Pursuing</em>,
 pencil work is most visible where the overlying pen-and-ink lines or 
washes stray from the under-drawing. The sides of the background doorway
 in <em>Christ Descending into the Grave</em> and a few lines of 
radiance above Christ’s head seem to be in pencil. Two of the latter 
were ignored by Blake when he drew over most of these lines in pen and 
ink. Some lines defining the ruffled hem of Christ’s garment, also not 
followed by the pen, are pencil. One or two pencil strokes right of the 
man’s waist and left hip in <em>Prone on the Lonely Grave—She Drops</em>
 show that Blake moved these motifs slightly to the left when he drew 
them in pen and ink. There are a few sketchy pencil lines defining cloud
 outlines, and some odd pencil strokes on the man’s upper left chest, in
 <em>Whilst Surfeited upon Thy Damask Cheek</em>. Other designs in the 
group of seventeen show similar odd bits of pencil work, including the 
bottom edge of the cloth covering the bed in <em>The Soul Hovering over the Body Reluctantly Parting with Life</em>, cloud outlines and the decorations at the top of the columns in <em>Heaven’s Portals Wide Expand to Let Him In</em>, and lines of radiance and shading on the base of the doorway and its posts and lintel in <em>Death’s Door</em>. All in all, the under-drawing that can be seen in these watercolors is sparse and sketchy.</td>

      <td class="body">Most of the extant preliminary pencil drawings for the <em>Grave</em> watercolors are little more than quick sketches, first thoughts on paper.&nbsp;<a href="#fn14" name="fr14" id="fr14">[14]</a> Significantly, none of these sketches, unlike <em>Death Pursuing</em>,
 has a provenance leading back to either R. H. or T. H. Cromek. Many are
 traceable to Frederick Tatham, who very probably acquired them from 
Catherine Blake, who inherited them from her husband. Apparently Blake 
supplied the elder Cromek only with the washed or colored drawings and 
retained the preliminaries; this would have been standard procedure for 
commissioned work. Only the sketch for <em>The Soul Hovering over the Body Reluctantly Parting with Life</em>
 includes indications of the figures’ facial features, but varies in 
several major respects (e.g., the position, configuration, and costuming
 of the man’s body) from the watercolor. Even if the pencil drawing 
lying beneath the washes of <em>Death Pursuing</em> had been developed as fully as the sketch for <em>The Soul Hovering</em>,
 the colorist (whether Blake or someone else) created most of what we 
now see. Death’s face is carefully detailed with very small brushstrokes
 (<a href="45.2.essickfour" target="_blank">illus. 4</a>);
 it is highly unlikely that the colorist was merely following pencil 
lines. The freely drawn lines defining the Soul’s dangling hair (<a href="45.2.essickfive" target="_blank">illus. 5</a>) and flames covering Death’s left hand (<a href="45.2.essicktwo" target="_blank">illus. 2</a>) appear to have been executed with pen and ink alone. The act of coloring was also an act of composition.</td>

      <td class="paranumber">16</td>
      <td class="body">Apparently another reason for Butlin’s sense that <em>Death Pursuing</em> “stands out” from the <em>Grave</em>
 watercolors is the “rather heavy manner” of the “washes,” a manner 
“uncharacteristic of Blake’s own hand.” I suspect that any such labored 
handling is most apparent in Death’s face and body (<a href="45.2.essickthree" target="_blank">illus. 3</a>, <a href="45.2.essickfour" target="_blank">4</a>); the rest of the composition, including the personified Soul, does not seem at all heavy to me. The <em>Grave</em>
 watercolors, all referred to as “finished” by Butlin, exhibit a wide 
range of styles, techniques, and levels of finish. Indeed, one could 
claim that several of the watercolors stand out from their companions on
 stylistic or technical grounds. <em>Death of the Strong Wicked Man</em> and <em>The Grave Personified</em>
 are quite richly colored with considerable attention to flesh tones 
created through the application of very small brushstrokes in blue, 
brown, and rose. In contrast, parts of <em>Prone on the Lonely Grave—She Drops</em> are left uncolored or shaded only with broad washes. <em>The Day of Judgment</em>
 exhibits a wide range of coloring techniques. An area of dark sky above
 the dome in the lower right quadrant, probably applied with a 
relatively dry brush, shows the sort of fine reticulations we can also 
see on Death’s face, right arm, right thigh, and torso in <em>Death Pursuing</em> (<a href="45.2.essickthree" target="_blank">illus. 3</a>, <a href="45.2.essickfour" target="_blank">4</a>)—and in the same or a very similar color. The detailed brushwork in <em>Death Pursuing</em> also recalls Blake’s work as a portrait miniaturist begun in 1801 under William Hayley’s tutelage.&nbsp;<a href="#fn15" name="fr15" id="fr15">[15]</a> Butlin has interestingly associated <em>A Destroying Deity</em>, a drawing in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, with the <em>Grave</em>
 designs and has even identified a passage in the poem it may illustrate
 (Blake Trust publication, p. 54). This deity’s bat-like wings are 
strikingly similar to Death’s and, to my eye, executed in a similar 
manner with washes and pen-and-ink outlining.</td>

      <td class="body">Butlin’s proposal that someone had “gone over” <em>Death Pursuing</em>
 “to make it more saleable in the later 19th century” prompts several 
questions. The history of the drawing after T. H. Cromek, who died in 
1873, is somewhat speculative until it entered the collection of Mrs. 
Artemas Holmes, Philadelphia, no earlier than the 1930s. It may have 
been the drawing sold at Christie’s in 1880 for £1.15s.&nbsp;<a href="#fn16" name="fr16" id="fr16">[16]</a>
 Thus, the work had very little market value in the second half of the 
nineteenth century. The tinting of Death’s face and parts of his body is
 minutely articulated with small brushstrokes; the blue and red touches 
are hardly visible to the naked eye. Why would anyone go to all the 
trouble to execute such detailed work, principally in monochrome washes,
 when a few splashes of rich color (perhaps yellows and fiery reds, pink
 flesh for the Soul, prominent blood on her neck) would have added much 
more to the drawing’s saleability? It is possible that a colorist may 
have believed that the labor required for detailed development of the 
drawing would be adequately compensated in the marketplace, but if 
prompted by a profit motive such a colorist must have been badly 
informed about the commercial value of Blake’s art and sorely 
disappointed.</td>

      <td class="body">No amount of argument or theorizing can overcome 
the primacy of the vision and intuitions of the connoisseur’s eye. I 
have no vain hope of changing anyone’s opinion of <em>Death Pursuing</em>,
 least of all Butlin’s. Rather, my purpose has been to exemplify some 
ways of using reproductions and historical contexts in cases of 
attribution, particularly when a leading expert has vacillated between 
attribution and deattribution. Although I believe that <em>Death Pursuing</em>
 is entirely Blake’s work, I must confess to some slight misgivings. If 
someone else fiddled with the drawing, I suspect that it was fairly 
early in its history and confined to Death’s face.&nbsp;<a href="#fn17" name="fr17" id="fr17">[17]</a>
 The most likely candidate for any such intervention is T. H. Cromek, a 
skilled watercolorist, although I find little similarity between the 
techniques used in <em>Death Pursuing</em> and Cromek’s renderings of 
landscapes and buildings. Whatever the truth, however, Cromek, Butlin, 
and I would appear to share a common fate, spending part of our lives 
brooding over <em>Death Pursuing</em>.</td>

Thomas Hartley Cromek with Records of Blake and Turner and Other 
Contemporary Artists” (2008) [43-44]. The Cromek papers are now in 
Princeton University Library. It is unlikely that Frost, born in 1810, 
was the origin of the erroneous association with <em>The Book of Urizen</em>. As Bentley (638fn) points out, “it is difficult to determine whether the mistaken association with <em>Urizen</em>
 originated with Cunningham or with T. H. Cromek.” In his catalogue of 
Blake’s drawings and paintings, William Michael Rossetti places a work 
probably identifiable as <em>Death Pursuing</em> in the possession of the London dealer Francis Harvey by 1863; see Alexander Gilchrist, <em>Life of William Blake, “Pictor Ignotus”</em>
 (London: Macmillan, 1863) 2: 241, no. 15. Perhaps Cromek lent the 
drawing to Harvey, or placed it on consignment with him, in the same 
year in which he described it as a “subject which I have.”</p>
<p><a href="#fr11" name="fn11" id="fn11">11</a>. The complete prospectus is reproduced in Bentley 210-12. <em>Death Pursuing</em> was excluded when Cromek reduced the number of illustrations to the twelve published in his 1808 edition.</p>
<p><a href="#fr12" name="fn12" id="fn12">12</a>. I can find only monochrome washes in <em>The Counseller, King, Warrior, Mother and Child in the Tomb</em>,
 described by Butlin as “pen, ink and watercolour over pencil” (no. 4 in
 the Blake Trust volume). It is quite possible that the “characteristic 
Frontispiece” is the design used on the title page of Cromek’s edition 
(Butlin’s no. 1) or, less probably, <em>The Grave Personified</em> (no. 13) or <em>Our Time Is Fix’d and All Our Days Are Number’d!</em> (no. 18). These three are among the nineteen <em>Grave</em> watercolors discovered in 2001; none is listed in the first prospectus.</p>
