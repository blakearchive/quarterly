                <p>Several answers have been received concerning Blake courses. Professor G. E. Bentley, Jr.
writes: “Frye and I have for alternate years given graduate courses on Blake at Toronto.” Professor John E.
Grant of the University of Iowa says: “I have made him the sole or primary subject of the seminar on
Romanticism for the last two years and will again do so next year. Specifically: 1966, Poetry and Design in
Blake; 1967, Long Poems of Blake and Keats; 1968, ‘Lyrical Ballads’ and ‘Songs of Innocence and of
Experience.” Professor Irene H. Chayes gave an undergraduate and a graduate course on Blake at the State
University of New York at Binghamton in 1966-67. Professor Martha W. England gave a graduate seminar on Blake
at Queens College (City University of New York) in the spring of 1967. “The title was catalogued ‘Blake and
His Contemporaries,’ but we discussed only contemporary <hi rend="u">artists</hi>—and these very briefly.
Discussions were based almost altogether on color slides of Blake’s books.”</p>
