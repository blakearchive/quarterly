                    </head>
                    <p>A glance through <hi rend="u">Bibliotheca Reediana</hi> (London, 1807), the sale
catalogue of the library of Isaac Reed, reveals that gentleman as a bookbuyer with interests far outside his
own profession of theater history. He was in fact a kind of bookstall omnivore. It is therefore not surprising
that, as a friend of William Hayley and George Romney, Reed left two works by William Blake among the
possessions to be auctioned after his death.</p>
                    <p>In their <hi rend="u">Blake Bibliography</hi>, Professors Bentley and Nurmi list one of
these, but inaccurately (see item 431). “Blake’s Poetical Sketches— 1783” appears in the auction catalogue
but as lot 6577 and on page 302, not as the bibliographers note. According to the priced catalogue in the
Harvard College Library, the <hi rend="u">Poetical Sketches</hi> sold for six shillings sixpence, a
respectable price for the sale, on the thirtieth day of the auction, December 5, 1807.</p>
                    <p>A second Blake item, not listed in Bentley and Nurmi, was sold nine days later among
the prints and manuscripts. Lot 8936 (on page 404 of the catalogue) contained an unspecified number of prints
including “Designs to a Series of Ballads, by Hayley, engraved by Blake, 2 No. 1802”—clearly Bentley and
Nurmi number 375. This reference is the fifth known type-printed allusion to Blake during 1807 (see 
<hi rend="u">A Blake Bibliography</hi>, p. xvii). The entire lot, with the now very rare “Designs,” brought eleven
shillings sixpence.</p>
