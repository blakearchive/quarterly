                    <p>—. “Dinner by the Amateurs of Vegetable Diet (Extracted from an Old Paper),” 
<hi rend="i">The London Magazine and Theatrical Inquisitor</hi>, IV (1821), 31-35. Reprinted in <hi rend="i">The
Unextinguished Hearth: Shelley and His Contemporary Critics</hi>, ed. Newman Ivey White (Durham, N.C., 1938;
New York, 1966), pp. 263-269.</p>
					<q>
This witty sketch contains the following reference which may or may not be to Blake (Professor White suggests
that it is): “Mr. P[ercy] B[ysshe] S[helley] then gave, ‘the memory of Nebuchadnezzar, and may all
<pb id="p03-5" n="5"/>
kings, like him, be speedily sent to graze with their brother brutes.’ This toast excited much commotion,
but was drank at last, without the adjunct, which it was deemed prudent to omit. Mr. B[lake], of
Bible-celebrity, observed, that in supposing Nebuchadnezzar to have fed on grass, we are not borne out by the
Hebrew text. This he would prove in his intended translation of the Bible. He also took occasion to declare
his opinion, that the longevity of mankind before the flood was owing to their feeding on vegetables, not on
raw meat, as had been erroneously supposed; but these were points he trusted would be cleared up in his
treatise on ‘Antedeluvian Cherubim.’” (p. 267) If White is correct in his speculation, the first effort to
link Blake and Shelley comes earlier than Deborah Dorfman supposes (see <hi rend="i">Blake in the Nineteenth
Century: His Reputation as a Poet from Gilchrist to Yeats</hi> [New Haven, 1969], pp. 50-51).

Interpretations of Milton’s Sublimity and His <corr type="emend">Satan,” <hi rend="u">UTQ</hi>,</corr> XI (1941-42), 421-236.</p>
					<q>
Barker sees “the paradoxical interpretation” of Milton set forth by Blake and Shelley “as the fruit of a
steady (though complex) growth.”

This comprehensive survey of the literature of diabolism lists <hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and

This review contains a large portion of Eliot’s essay on Blake published in <hi rend="i">The Sacred

See esp. comments on Blake’s idea of Jerusalem (p. 299), on Ginsberg’s “ecstatic experience” from Blake
(pp. 300 ff.), on “Ah, Sun-flower” (pp. 304-305), on “The Little Girl Lost” (pp. 305-306).

					<q>
Huckabay traces the idea that Satan is the hero of <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi> “from its inception in
William Blake’s <hi rend="i">The Marriage of</hi>
                        <pb id="p03-6" n="6"/>
                        <hi rend="i">Heaven and Hell</hi> to its fruition in Sir Walter Raleigh’s

G. Jung) (London, 1952), pp. 107-110; also pp. 3, 61, 64, 81, 99, 101.</p>
					<q>
Werblowsky contributes significantly to our understanding of “Blake’s great contribution to Milton
criticism” but is misleading, sometimes confused, in many particulars, esp. in his insistence that Blake held
the Lucifer-Prometheus myth together by accepting Satan’s vitality “whilst ignoring the significance of his
evil.”

Novel. An imaginative interpretation of Blake’s relevance to the modern world. A commentary on this novel
