          <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abstract.</hi> This paper seeks to amend and extend Keri Davies’s essay on
Blake’s mother published in <hi rend="i">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</hi> in 1999.<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n32" type="note">1</ref> There, he established that Blake’s mother
Catherine’s true maiden name was Wright, and that Thomas Armitage, her first husband, was born in Royston,
Yorkshire in 1722, the son of Richard Armitage of Cudworth. Davies also produced evidence that contradicted E.
P. Thompson’s Muggletonian hypothesis, and speculated upon the identity of Blake’s maternal grandparents.
We now link Blake’s mother to a very different religious community, providing further evidence about her
first marriage, and correcting the assumptions Davies made in identifying Blake’s grandparents. These latest
discoveries about Blake’s mother disclose her place of birth (Walkeringham, Nottinghamshire), the names of
her parents and siblings, and her association with the Moravian sect. Documentary and autographic records in
the archive of the distinctive and exceptional eighteenth-century Moravian church, some dating from many years
before the poet was born, are a vivid indicator of how much of our thinking about Blake’s life and early
influences might need to be revised and rewritten in the future. <note id="n32">1. Keri Davies, “William

          <p>Biographical discussion of William Blake has long been dominated by unexamined commonplaces
regarding his family background, his early religious allegiance, and other aspects of his life and
personality. Three persistent <hi rend="i">topoi</hi> dominate the nearly two hundred years of biographical
writing about Blake. First, present even in Malkin’s <hi rend="i">A Father’s Memoirs of His Child</hi>, is
the question of Blake’s sanity (what Malkin calls “the hue and cry of 
madness”).<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n33" type="note">2</ref> 
Second, there is the belief that Blake had no contemporary
audience, and thus we in posterity are Blake’s true disciples. And third, the most misleading, because the
least examined, the insistence that he came from a radical dissenting 
family.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n34" type="note">3</ref>

for Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, 1806) xxii. And even earlier, in 1794, Richard Twiss wrote of Blake: “I
suppose the man to be mad; but he draws very well” (Letter to Francis Douce, 13 September 1794. Bodleian
Library MS. Douce d.39 fol.70v). See Keri Davies, “Mrs. Bliss: A Blake Collector of 1794,”

	<note id="n34">3. The assumption, on next to no evidence, that the Blake family belonged to some group that
rejected Anglican teaching, isolated and exclusive, doctrinally eccentric, somewhat like the
Muggletonians.</note></p>
          <p>A recent example of the madness <hi rend="i">topos</hi> appeared during the Tate Britain
“William Blake” exhibition of 2000-01. Thomas Stuttaford, the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> medical
correspondent, devoted his column to a diagnosis of Blake’s “schizophrenia.” Stuttaford wrote,
“although he was obsessively hard-working, Blake was also fascinated by the mystical from an early age,
which is another symptom displayed by those suffering from schizophreniform troubles.”<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n35" type="note">4</ref> As long ago as 1925, in his short witty
biography of Blake, Harold Bruce commented on the mad-or-not-mad <hi rend="i">topos</hi>:
<q>
To say confidently that Blake suffered from mythomania, or from automatism, or from occasional
hyper-aesthesia, or from manic-depressive tendencies, or that he did not tend ‘towards a definite
schizophrenia,’ is to add polysyllables rather than illumination to the discussion of his state.<supplied

          <p>The second <hi rend="i">topos</hi> is that indicated by Alexander Gilchrist in the subtitle to
his biography of 1863: <hi rend="i">pictor ignotus</hi>—the unknown painter—and with it the idea that
Blake had no contemporary audience. But there is plentiful evidence of that contemporary audience. In 1794,
Joseph Johnson, one of the foremost progressive publishers of the decade, was displaying Blake’s books for
prospective customers.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n37" type="note">6</ref> Bentley’s

          <p>The third assumption, the dissenting <hi rend="i">topos</hi>, first appears in Crabb Robinson’s
essay “William Blake, Künstler, Dichter und religiöser Schwärmer” of 
1811.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n39" type="note">8</ref> 
There Robinson notes that Blake belonged “von Geburt zu
einer dissentirenden Gemeinde”—from birth to a dissenting sect. But this was written before Crabb Robinson
ever met Blake. In the later account of Blake in Robinson’s diary, there is no further indication that he
belonged “zu einer dissentirenden Gemeinde.” The diary account was written after Robinson had met Blake
and become genuinely interested in him; Robinson records his conversations with Blake after they met in 1825
but never again does he call Blake a Dissenter.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n40"

worked on his biography in the late 1850s when a number of people who knew Blake were still alive, and it is
this first or second-hand information from those who knew Blake in his later years that gives Gilchrist’s
<hi rend="i">Life</hi> its continuing authority. Gilchrist makes very little use of documentary sources or
public records. This means that his biography is weakest for Blake’s life before he met Palmer and Linnell,
Gilchrist’s chief informants, and for any information about his family. <note id="n41">10. Alexander

          <p>It was not until 1906 that Arthur Symons consulted the parish registers of St. James’s
Piccadilly, to establish the dates of birth of William’s brothers and 
sister.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n42" type="note">11</ref> 
It took until 1947 for H. M. Margoliouth to locate the
marriage of James and Catherine, William’s parents (James Blake married Catherine “Harmitage” at the
Mayfair Chapel, 15 October 1752).<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n43" type="note">12</ref>
Bentley’s <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> spreads the known information about Blake’s life over 418 pages.
But the years 1757 to 1800, half of his life, occupy just the first 61 pages. Bentley adds little to
Gilchrist, Symons, and Margoliouth about Blake’s childhood and parentage. <note id="n42">11. Arthur Symons,

          <p>E. P. Thompson’s acclaimed <hi rend="i">Witness against the Beast</hi> is a recent example of
the persistence of unexamined and unverified ideas in Blake studies.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n44" type="note">13</ref> It became widely accepted that Thompson “offers plausible evidence to
suggest that Blake’s mother may well have come from a family with Muggletonian connections.”<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n45" type="note">14</ref> In reality, the Muggletonians were a small
Protestant sect whose membership is largely identifiable and contains no Blake relatives. Thompson does,
however, make the extraordinarily important discovery that Catherine, Blake’s mother, was married twice,
first to Thomas Armitage (whom Thompson calls “Hermitage”) and then to James Blake. This, in turn, led to
Keri Davies’s discovery of the date of Catherine Blake’s first marriage and her true maiden name (Wright).
We can now confidently say that Catherine Wright married Thomas Armitage on 14 December 1746, was widowed in
1751, and married James Blake in October 1752. <note id="n44">13. E. P. Thompson, <hi rend="i">Witness against

<hi rend="i">English Historical Review</hi> vol. 111, no. 442 (June 1996): 743-44.</note></p>
          <p>Davies suggested in 1999 that Blake’s mother was the daughter of John and Elizabeth Wright of
the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Assuming Catherine Wright to be a Londoner seemed the simplest
explanation, the one that gave the best fit with the known data. He was misled. He had unthinkingly accepted a
fourth <hi rend="i">topos</hi>, one given fullest elaboration by Peter Ackroyd: that of Blake the “cockney
visionary”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n46" type="note">15</ref> whom Davies assumed
must have had a cockney mother. <note id="n46">15. Peter Ackroyd, “Cockney Visionaries,” <hi rend="i">The
Independent</hi> 18 December 1993: 27, and in his <hi rend="i">Blake</hi> (London: Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995)
passim.</note></p>
          <p>Davies concluded in 1999 by stressing how the surviving evidence not only does not support
Thompson’s claims of a Muggletonian background to the Blake family, but in fact does not even support the
conventional view of the Blakes as Radical Dissenters. The research reported in this present paper is the
result of a suggestion made by the nineteenth-century facsimilist William Muir regarding Blake’s early
religious affiliation, which we felt warranted further 
investigation.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n47" type="note">16</ref>

          <p>The nature of Blake’s religious background and development has long been insufficiently
defined. In 1828 John Thomas Smith reported that William Blake had not attended “any place of Divine
Worship” for the last forty years of his life.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n48"
type="note">17</ref> Nancy Bogen suggests that “it seems reasonable to suppose that he was connected with a
religious organization prior to that time, that is, before 1787. Indeed, Blake must have received some sort of
religious training as a youth—but of what denomination remains to be 
seen.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n49" type="note">18</ref>

a boy and had, according to his own account, been a playfellow of Blake’s younger brother, Robert.</note>

          <p>The evidence of an Anglican marriage ceremony (though, without reading of banns or bishop’s
license, it was technically “clandestine”), and baptism of children in the parish church, but later family
burials at Bunhill Fields, suggests that the Blake family were originally Anglican, but that later on, after
28 January 1764 when the youngest child of the family (William’s sister Catherine) was baptized, they may
have become members of some dissenting congregation.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n50"
type="note">19</ref>
	<note id="n50">19. Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> 7-8, has suggested adherence to a Baptist
church.</note></p>
          <p>But another way of resolving this problem of Blake’s early religion is suggested by an item in
his deathbed conversation. It seems that during the course of discussing his last wishes, he had expressed a
preference for burial in Bunhill Fields, the Dissenters’ burial ground, and Mrs. Blake offered him a choice
as to funeral arrangements; that is, “either he would have the Dissenting Minister, or the Clergyman of the
Church of England, to read the service.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n51"
type="note">20</ref> It’s as though Catherine, his own wife, did not know where his preferences lay. Blake,
in this account, chose the Church of England. The possibility
<pb id="p38-38" n="38"/>
then raised by Nancy Bogen is that Blake and his family were Anglicans and at same time maintained a
connection with the Moravian Church.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n52" type="note">21</ref>
The position of this body in England during the eighteenth century was quite unusual. While it was recognized
by an Act of Parliament as an episcopal church and therefore a sister to the Church of England, its members
were still required to have their places of worship licensed as Dissenting chapels. In other words, they 
<hi rend="i">were</hi> and then again <hi rend="i">were not</hi> Dissenters. Also, having been more intent on
evangelizing than proselytizing, the Moravians encouraged those who joined their congregation not to sever
their tie with whatever denomination they had been born into. The Moravians were only too pleased when they
could lead their adherents back to the local parish church for the ministration of the vicar.<supplied
type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n53" type="note">22</ref> Accordingly, one could be an Anglican and a
Moravian at the same time—and it turns out that a majority of the English brethren were and remained loyal
members of the Church of England. <note id="n51">20. Bentley, <hi rend="i">Blake Records</hi> 476.</note>

          <p>This theory of Blake’s Moravian connection was first advanced by Thomas Wright and later
enlarged upon by Margaret Ruth Lowery, their informal source of information having been William Muir. It
deserves a fair hearing because Muir was explicit; that is, according to him, Blake’s parents “attended
the Moravian Chapel in Fetter Lane”—and such a chapel did exist, having been established around 1738. Muir
and Wright suggested the influence of Moravian hymns on Blake’s <hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of
Experience</hi>, while Lowery notes the “striking resemblance” between Blake’s “The Lamb” (E 8-9)
and the Moravian James Hutton’s hymn, “O Lamb of God So Mild.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref

the Moravian argument.</note></p>
          <p>In 1743 the names “Mr. and Mrs. Blake” appeared on the register of the Fetter Lane Society,
at a time when seventy-two members formed “The Congregation of the Lamb,” a society “within the Church
of England in union with the Moravian Brethren.” The Blake couple were perhaps William’s grandparents,
James Blake’s parents. And it even may be that the Mr. and Mrs. Parker on the 1743 list were the parents of
Blake’s later business partner, James Parker. When William Muir wrote to Margaret Ruth Lowery in 1936,
claiming that Blake’s parents attended the Moravian Chapel in Fetter Lane, he may merely have seen the list
transcribed by Abraham Reincke and published in 1873:

Catherine and Thomas Armitage and by John Blake. Schuchard and Davies then made further exploration of this
important archive. The results have proved to be of the first importance for an understanding of Blake’s
biography and will have serious implications for the study of his works. <note id="n57">26. Schuchard had

                            28. Moravian Archive: Congregation Diary, vol. I (11 Nov. 1741-23 Nov. 1742). The
term “slave” was frequently used for a believer’s self-humbling in imitation of Christ. In a London
sermon, Zinzendorf imagined the wounded Jesus speaking to the individual:
                            <p>Do you want me? Do you receive me? Am I acceptable to you? Do I please your
heart? See, here I am! This is the way I look . . . For the sake of your sins I was torn, beaten, and put to
death . . . Do I in this way please you? Do I please you better in the idea of a mangled slave who is thrown
to the wild beasts in the circus, or in the form of the emperor who sits high on the throne and takes pleasure
in the destruction of the poor creature?</p>
	<p>See Zinzendorf, <hi rend="i">Nine Lectures on Important Subjects in Religion, Preached in Fetter Lane

James consists simply in that they lived in the same house.</note></p>
          <p>All this, of course, is speculation, but of much the greatest importance are the references to a
Moravian Church member called Thomas Armitage (already established as the name of Blake’s mother’s first
husband). Thus, in the Congregation Diary for 1751:
<q>
Sat. Sept. 28, 1751. Br. Armitage, being sick, and having long desired it, had the H. Communion administered
to him privately. At 1:00 was Sabb[ath] L[ove] F[east] at

Could this really be Catherine Blake’s first husband? Confirmatory data can be found in the Church Book of
“The Congregation of the Lamb . . . as Settled Octr 30 1742. in London,” which contains a tabulated list
of members. Thus, we find an entry for
<q>

          <p>We thus see that, in 1750-51, the Moravian congregation at Fetter Lane included a young couple,
Thomas and Catherine Armitage, and Thomas has the place and approximate date of birth (Royston, Yorkshire,
1723 for 1722), the profession (hosier), and the death in November 1751, already established for Catherine
Blake’s first husband. What is more, the archive includes documents from their hands. Persons wishing to
participate fully in the Congregation of the Lamb were encouraged

Hence she did not show up in the trawl for a Catherine Wright born before 1725 that Davies recorded in his

Benjamin, christened 23 September 1729.
</q>
William Blake now has uncles and an aunt. Most of their names recur for the Blake children. But none of the
Blake children are named after their maternal grandfather, Gervase. Had Catherine quarreled with her father?
Or is it just that “Gervase” is too much of a “country-bumpkin” name for an upwardly mobile London
family? Her mother Mary’s name is also conspicuously absent. Catherine’s brother Benjamin, who married
Elizabeth Whitehead in 1754, has children Richard (born 1759), Elizabeth (1763), Catherine (1766), Thomas
(1769), and Mary (1772). Again, none of the sons are given their paternal grandfather’s name.<supplied

Nottinghamshire County archives, include those of several members of the family. Benjamin Wright, yeoman, in
his will, proven 12 February 1685 O.S. (1686 N.S.), left £5 to the poor of the parish, with a number of
legacies and bequests of sheep. Gervase Wright, maltster and yeoman, perhaps Catherine’s grandfather, was
comfortably off; the inventory of his estate, 7 October 1700, includes malt worth £120 out of a total value
of the estate of £384. The village origins of Blake’s mother suggest the possibility of linking Blake with
a surviving peasant culture and not just the emerging urban proletarian one so often assumed.<supplied

Perhaps John Adlard, <hi rend="i">The Sports of Cruelty: Fairies, Folk-Songs, Charms and Other Country Matters
in the Work of William Blake</hi> (London: C. &amp; A. Woolf, 1972), deserves at least a second
glance.</note></p>
          <p>This present paper, modifying Davies’s own published work (itself corrective of previous
scholarship), indicates how much inaccurate or incomplete information abounds about even the most basic
details of Blake’s life. The intuitions of William Muir, of Margaret Ruth Lowery, and of Nancy Bogen as to
the influence on Blake of Moravian hymnody are now shown to have some basis in fact; without Muir’s
assertions, the Moravian archive would have been left unexplored. In a second paper in preparation we shall
consider a few of the Blakean topics which now demand attention—his relationship with “heart religion,”
his eclectic combination of different strands of culture, the importance of music, his view of childhood and
of Jesus. For Blake scholars, the discovery of the Armitage and Blake documents in the Moravian archives at
Muswell Hill opens up a new frontier in Blake studies.</p>
