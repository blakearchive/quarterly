    <tr>
      <td class="paranumber">1</td>
      <td class="body">The title of the 2009 Petit Palais exhibition and
 its accompanying catalogue offers an extraordinarily loaded and complex
 epithet: “The Visionary Genius of English Romanticism.” Both the show 
and the book, an illustrated collection of essays and other reactions 
written in or translated into French, were clearly shaped by the need to
 (re)introduce Blake to a French audience. As is pointed out more than 
once in the book, there had been no major exhibition of Blake’s art in 
the country since 1947. Indeed, for the second half of the twentieth 
century Blake’s reputation had rested largely on his writings, which 
were repeatedly translated, and were championed by a number of French 
cultural heroes, including Pierre Berger and André Gide. At the Petit 
Palais, by reuniting series of drawings, prints, and paintings, 
attention was focused instead upon the processes involved in Blake’s 
image-making and his role as a visual artist, not to overturn but to 
augment the received perception of him as a writer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">2</td>
      <td class="body">Initially the text seems not only to support but 
to develop these aims. Following Daniel Marchesseau’s overview of 
Blake’s place in the French cultural consciousness—a necessary act of 
reflection that prepares the ground for further interrogation of his 
work—comes a piece of poetic prose by Yves Bonnefoy. When confronted 
with this dynamic personal response, we may suspect that the aim of the 
catalogue is to eulogize Blake rather than to examine his works with any
 critical rigor, but this would be a false impression. Coming directly 
after Bonnefoy’s lyrical descriptions, Michael Phillips’s précis of 
Blake’s career offers a revealing counterpoint in its clear and 
authoritative outline of the social, historical, and cultural conditions
 under which Blake created his works. It soon becomes apparent that it 
was wise to insert this more conventional introductory essay after 
Bonnefoy’s more subjective interpretative text. The two essays are 
delicately balanced, and illustrate nicely the difficulties involved in 
staging any exhibition of Blake’s work. Phillips’s intricate technical 
knowledge complements and enriches Bonnefoy’s more emotive portrait of 
the artist, adding a sense of wonder at Blake’s practical innovation to 
an admiration of his imagination. Furthermore, by reminding the reader 
of the laborious process of mediation between the conception of the 
artist and the production of the work, Phillips challenges the notion of
 a visionary experience directly recorded, without diminishing in any 
way the reputation of the artist.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">3</td>
      <td class="body">Parallels between Blake’s philosophies and his 
techniques are suggested, laying a constructive foundation for new 
viewers to reflect upon these correspondences in the diverse works on 
display. The correspondence between the act of cutting or biting into 
the plate and Blake’s notion of man’s innate knowledge is used to 
illustrate the intimate connection between his practice and his attitude
 towards the rationalist theories of Locke and Newton. Phillips deals 
with the allegorical nature of Blake’s techniques most evocatively, 
however, in relation to <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>. 
Describing with great delicacy the process of printing these poems, he 
suggests that the transparent quality of the medium allowed reflected 
light to shine through from the paper beneath, recalling the notion of 
the divine image in man, and lending a new meaning to the phrase 
“illuminated printing.”</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">4</td>
      <td class="body">Occasionally Phillips’s descriptions of Blake’s 
radical innovations in printmaking are oversimplified, and succumb to 
the myth of the artist as an isolated genius, born before his time. But 
in general, by locating precedents for Blake’s images, emphasizing the 
sheer industry involved in their construction, and outlining the 
pressures—artistic and financial—experienced by the artist, Phillips 
provides the viewer with a contextual framework that is enabling rather 
than restrictive.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">5</td>
      <td class="body">This, though, is where the catalogue begins to 
lose its way as a means of introducing these works by Blake to the 
French. The text might easily have been confined to something like these
 first three essays, within which much of the information in the later 
material might have been incorporated (Céline Mansanti’s useful survey 
of Blake’s reception in France, for example, or David Steel’s work on 
Blake and André Gide). It would then have been sufficient simply to 
reproduce all the exhibited works, dividing these into smaller isolated 
series, tracing a broad overarching narrative of Blake’s career as seen 
in the exhibition itself. This would have given a clearer shape and 
identity to the catalogue as a whole, by virtue of both a loose 
chronology and at least an element of visual and thematic structure. 
Instead, there are twenty-six short essays, ranging from around 1500 to 
3000 words, each focusing tightly on one issue—aesthetic, contextual, 
iconographic—relating to Blake’s practice. With so great a range of 
authors and subjects some repetition is inevitable, but it is hard to 
excuse the large overlaps among several of the essays. Most striking, 
and unfortunate, are the echoes between Phillips’s introduction and the 
text by Martin Butlin that immediately succeeds it, but these are only 
the first of many. By the third description of Blake’s visit to 
Westminster Abbey, the reader could be forgiven for skimming the 
remaining twenty or so entries.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">6</td>
      <td class="body">This is not to say that the texts are 
uninteresting. Many of the themes are well selected and the writing is 
often illuminating, helping to contextualize Blake’s work without simply
 inserting it into conventional histories. Bethan Stevens, for example, 
provides a sophisticated analysis of <em>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</em>
 in relation to the writing of Mary Wollstonecraft and the analogies she
 draws between slavery and marriage. Although alert to the points of 
disagreement between Blake and Wollstonecraft, who occupied quite 
distinct positions on the matter of sexual liberation, Stevens provides a
 fascinating exploration of Blake’s unorthodox belief that slavery 
caused suffering not only to those enslaved but to their masters. Via a 
close reading of Blake’s treatment of the body and the language employed
 by Wollstonecraft, Stevens constructs a forceful argument for 
reevaluating <em>Visions</em> in light of late-eighteenth-century politics, both domestic and international.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">7</td>
      <td class="body">The complexity of Blake’s political and cultural 
positioning is further drawn out in Saree Makdisi’s fascinating 
examination of the concepts of unity and difference and David Fuller’s 
essay on the <em>Divine Comedy</em> images, while the intricate webbing 
of patronage, heritage, and homage is sensitively examined by Andrew 
Loukes in reference to Blake’s portraits of poets. Other authors offer 
evidence of Blake’s engagement with cultural trends, in particular Jared
 Richman, who considers the wide popularity of Milton’s poetry and 
Blake’s peculiarly biographical interest in him. This approach is 
developed by Martin Myrone, who skillfully situates Blake’s interest in 
the supernatural and the sublime in the context of a contemporary vogue 
for the Gothic, while insisting upon the particularity of his practice. 
There is also a welcome passage on Blake’s immediate predecessors by 
William Pressly, in which the artist is seen as the legatee of a 
specifically British tradition.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">8</td>
      <td class="body">This theme of national heritage is also treated by Robin Simon in his discussion of <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>.
 Simon interprets Blake’s engagement with familiar symbols of British 
identity as a means by which the artist introduced the quotidian or 
colloquial into a visionary language, by adopting the informal idiom of 
Wordsworth, or through reference to the game of cricket. Although the 
implication that a sense of national pride can be found in Blake’s work 
is unconvincing, Simon offers an interesting consideration of Blake’s 
aesthetic choices and the way in which they embodied a rejection of 
Reynolds’s theories of art.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">9</td>
      <td class="body">Simon’s close reading of Blake’s pictures, 
however, is an exception which points up one of the problems of the 
catalogue: the concentration upon Blake’s writing. While Simon and some 
others tackle Blake’s symbolic visual imagery, a large number of the 
essays, among them some of the most engaging, are entirely dedicated to 
the poems, or gesture towards the images only as illustrations. 
Naturally, a great deal of explanation and interpretation is needed in 
introducing a non-English-speaking audience to Blake as an author. While
 it may be of great interest to consider the effect of translating 
Blake’s work into French, or the prophetic nature (or otherwise) of <em>Europe </em>and <em>America</em>,
 it is arguable, however, whether this is the place to do so. This is 
not to demand a strict separation of text from image, which would be 
contrary to the nature of the works themselves; when faced with so vast a
 subject it may perhaps have been more helpful to have limited 
discussion to the objects on display, of which there were more than 
enough to furnish a rich investigation of Blake’s career.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">10</td>
      <td class="body">This in turn flags another, and perhaps more 
serious, flaw: the inadequate and incoherent use of illustrations. 
Images are referred to throughout by catalogue number, which (as not all
 objects in the show are reproduced) leaves the reader searching through
 pictures that are not in numerical order, and are rarely positioned in 
clear relation to the text. This is compounded by inconsistency, when 
Martin Butlin (uniquely) decides to employ the numbering system from his
 catalogue <em>The Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</em> in order
 to direct readers to relevant (but unexhibited) works. With so varied a
 selection of themes, and very little clear structure to their 
arrangement, this added confusion is particularly keenly felt.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="paranumber">11</td>
      <td class="body">Furthermore, the texts are too short to deal with
 their subjects adequately, and too often the writers seem to have been 
trapped into oversimplification, as in the case of David Alexander, who 
discusses Blake’s relationships with his patrons with no critical look 
at the artist’s investment in establishing a reputation as romantic 
outsider, or Elizabeth C. Denlinger, whose study of Catherine Blake 
reads as an unsatisfactorily token gesture towards a forgotten partner. 
In essence, while the questions raised by the catalogue are apposite, 
and many essays introduce themes that have not been dealt with in the 
French literature on Blake, it might have been more productive to have 
limited the overall length of the text and included a fuller 
bibliography for those who wanted to explore further. This would then 
have provided the space for what would really have stimulated an 
enthusiasm for Blake’s pictures: high-quality reproductions of the works
 themselves, clearly arranged to allow for comparison and 
cross-referencing. Without these, the catalogue can only help to 
reinforce the notion that Blake’s true achievement was literary, and his
 images merely illustrative or incidental.</td>
