                    <p>A semester Blake course is being given this fall in the SUNY CEH (Continuing Education
in the Humanities) format, and seems to be going well. Thursdays at 7 p.m. Erdman holds forth, usually with
slides, in one of the new lecture rooms—attendance of around 160 (half undergraduates, half schoolteachers);
at 8:30 or earlier the class divides into five sections for “seminars” led by five dissertation-contemplating
Teaching Assistants (dissertations on Blake, of course). The teaching group, with a few stray grad students
who have joined the course, gather about 4 p.m. to start the conversation; it ends finally at 10 p.m., or
later. One small knot continued past midnight. Then on Tuesday mornings we have a reading aloud of 
<hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi>, reaching Night the Eighth on Election Day. (The bureaucratic rubric for the
course is “The Great Tradition. I.”)</p>
