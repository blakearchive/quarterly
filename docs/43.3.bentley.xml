            <p>WILLIAM Blake engraved and etched hundreds of copperplates, but only forty-nine of them are
known to have survived.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n93" type="note">1</ref> The
information embedded in the metal of engravings can extend very considerably what we can deduce from prints
made from them. However, most of the plates engraved by Blake and his contemporaries have long since been
reduced to their constituent copper and converted to shoe buckles and cannon, sheathing for ships and wire.
Consequently, the discovery of more is very exciting.</p>
            <note id="n93">1. See “Blake’s Heavy Metal: The History, Weight, Uses, Cost, and Makers of His
Copper Plates,” <hi rend="i">University of Toronto Quarterly</hi> 76.2 (2007): 744; Blake also made seven
temperas on copper. His woodblocks for Virgil survive in the British Museum Department of Prints and Drawings,
but his only lithographic stone (of Enoch) does not survive.</note>
            <p>The print-making and -selling firm of Thomas Ross Limited in Binfield, Berkshire, has in its
archive almost 10,000 copperplates dating from 1720 to the 1990s. These include designs by Flaxman, Hogarth,
Linnell, and Stothard, but “the plates by William Blake ... are the most valuable in the
Collection.”<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n94" type="note">2</ref></p>

Ross Collection. RM Healey pays a visit,” <hi rend="i">Rare Book Review</hi> (April-May 2007): 50-53. Healey
does not identify the Blake plates in the archive.</note>
            <p>The firm is descended from John Dixon, who printed proofs of Blake’s 
<hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job</hi> on 3-4 March 1825,<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref
target="n95" type="note">3</ref> and from Dixon &amp; Ross, who printed twenty-five sets of Blake’s seven
Dante engravings on 26 September 1838.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n96"
type="note">4</ref> Over the next 170 years it acquired the stock of printers and publishers, generally
without plate inventories, including the major firms of McQueen (founded c. 1700), acquired in the 1960s) and
Mauroo (founded 1900, acquired in 2000 with a stock of 2,600 plates). The business was acquired about thirty
years ago by the Nutbrown family. They keep over half of their stock in print (listed at
&lt;http://www.thomasross.co.uk&gt;), chiefly sailing, hunting, sporting, genre, and architectural scenes sold
directly to galleries, framers, and interior designers rather than at retail. Though the Blake copperplates,
twenty-six in all, are said to be the most valuable in the collection, only the Canterbury Pilgrims plate is
kept in print, and Mr. Lindsay Nutbrown tells me that they sell only three or four of them a year. The others
have not been printed in living memory.</p>

            <p>As only the Canterbury Pilgrims plate is identified on the Ross web site, Nutbrown generously
described the Blakes for me. They consist of the Canterbury Pilgrims plate, the twenty-two plates for
Blake’s <hi rend="i">Illustrations of the Book of Job</hi>, the portrait of Blake engraved after Thomas
Phillips by Louis Schiavonetti as the frontispiece to Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> (1808), a double plate
of Blake and Catherine drawn by Frederick J. Shields after outlines by Blake, and a portrait of Catherine. The
dimensions of the plates (given as height x width in cm.) are very significant:

            <p>The dimensions indicate that the plates of Job, the Canterbury Pilgrims, and the
Phillips-Schiavonetti portrait are reduced-size facsimiles of the originals which happen to survive elsewhere.
Blake’s Job copperplates were commissioned (1823) and published (1826) by John Linnell, whose grandson
Herbert Linnell gave them to the British Museum Department of Prints and Drawings in 1919 
(<hi rend="i">BB</hi> #421). The Canterbury Pilgrims plate (1810) is now in the Yale University Art Gallery.
Blake’s twelve plates for Blair’s <hi rend="i">Grave</hi> and the frontispiece portrait of him by Phillips
were commissioned by Robert Hartley Cromek, engraved by Schiavonetti, and published in 1808, 1813, [1870], and
1926; the Blair designs were reprinted in Mora’s <hi rend="i">Meditaciones Poeticas</hi> (1826) 
(<hi rend="i">BB</hi> #484). The copperplates were acquired by Lessing J. Rosenwald in 1938 and given to the
National Gallery of Art (<hi rend="i">BB</hi> #435).</p>
            <p>Probably some of the Ross plates were made for the second edition of Gilchrist’s 
<hi rend="i">Life of William Blake</hi> (1880)—no longer “pictor ignotus” as in 1863. The dimensions are
similar or identical to those in the 1880 edition:

            <p>The Job prints are more problematical. When they were first printed in Gilchrist (1863, vol.
2), they show no intended platemark (in the Victoria University copy), and the only measurements feasible are
of the framing lines, which do not include the imprint. When the prints appeared in 1880 (vol. 2), they are on
India paper showing clear platemarks with four rounded corners (in the Victoria University copy). The
dimensions of the framing lines are significantly larger in 1863 than in 1880:

            <p>In the list of illustrations, the 1863 Job prints are called photo-lithographs, and lithographs
would leave no platemarks. The superior 1880 prints are said to be “Photo-Intaglios” produced by the
Typographic Etching Company.<supplied type="spacer"> </supplied><ref target="n97" type="note">5</ref></p>

            <p>I conclude that the three Ross portraits of the Blakes almost certainly were those made for the
second edition of Gilchrist (1880) and that the Ross plates for Job may well have been made for the first
edition of Gilchrist (1863).</p>
            <p>It is curious that the Gilchrist copperplates should have been separated after 1880, for the
other prints appearing in 1863 and 1880 do not appear to be in the Ross collection. The list of illustrations
in the second edition gives the source of six plates as “Block lent by Messrs. Scribner &amp; Co.”:

            <p>The copperplate in the Ross Archive of Stothard’s Canterbury Pilgrims design rivaling
Blake’s seems to be approximately the same dimensions as the original and may well be the plate actually
engraved by Louis Schiavonetti, <corr type="emend">Niccolò Schiavonetti,</corr> James Heath, and Worthington and finally published in
1817. In its time this was a far better known plate than any of Blake’s, and its discovery in the archive is
of great interest.</p>
