<p><strong>Metal material  in <em>Jerusalem</em> copy
E<br>
</strong>All descriptions of the metal material (based on the plates observed
under magnification, April 2006) and images by Angus Whitehead; reproduction by permission
of the Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection (B1992.8.1(1-107)). </p>
<p>William Blake, <em>Jerusalem</em> copy E, pl. 14, "One hair nor particle
  of dust ..." (detail). Relief
  etching printed in orange, with pen, watercolor, and gold, 13 1/2 x 10 3/8
  in. (34.3 x 26.4 cm.)</p>
<p><img src="jergoldrainbow.jpg" width="650" height="488" align="top"></p>
<p> There is a fairly thick streak
  of gold on the right-hand side of the plate running outside and parallel with
  the rainbow. From the upper left to the right-hand end of the rainbow,
  running through its center, there are specks and patches of metal material forming
  a fairly continuous arc of gold. There is a large patch of shell silver (or
  possibly an alloy or very light gold) in the middle of the lower four stars inside the arc of the rainbow. Only the middle of each star is gilded—perhaps
  Blake could not sufficiently control the metal material to color the outer
  points of the stars without going beyond their edges.<br>
</p>
<p>William Blake, <em>Jerusalem</em> copy E, pl. 63, "Jehovah stood
  among the Druids ..." (detail). Relief etching printed in orange, with pen,
  watercolor, and gold, 13 1/2 x 10 3/8 in. (34.3 x 26.4 cm.)</p>
<p><img src="jerworm.jpg" width="650" height="488"></p>
<p>Small specks of gold material are visible under the female's tresses,
  and larger patches can be traced below her armpit. From her lower right thigh
  onwards, there is a significant amount of shell gold extending down to the
  right of her feet. All of this material has been applied on the green (watercolor
  wash?) the figure and the worm recline upon. To the right there is a patch
  of shell gold to the right of the worm's rightmost extremity. Light
  gold has been applied around and between the rays of the crescent moon. Also
some specks are evident around the bottom of the crescent moon.<br>
</p>
<p>William Blake, <em>Jerusalem</em> copy E, pl. 97, "Awake! Awake Jerusalem
  ..," (detail). Relief etching printed in orange, with pen, watercolor, and gold,
  13 1/2 x 10 3/8 in. (34.3 x 26.4 cm.)</p>
<p><img src="jergoldc.jpg" width="650" height="488"></p>
<p> Silver or light gold material is evident on the left-hand side of the crescent
  moon. Numerous streaks and patches of gold material surround the sun in Los'(?)
  left hand. There are several spots of gold to the left of his arm and shoulder.
  Behind Los, a line of specks of gold extends from below his armpit to the top
  of the grass intersecting with his left calf.</p>
<p><strong>Notes on metal material on other <em>Jerusalem</em> copy E
    plates</strong></p>
<p>Pl. 1 <br>
  Very small flecks of shell gold are apparent above
  either side of the archway, especially to the left. There are two vertical
  thin (ruled?) lines to the right of the top of the arch and five similar lines
  at the bottom left-hand outer corner of the arch, probably applied with a pen.
  These lines run parallel to lines applied in dark ink. There
  is also gold material (probably shell gold) on the inner apex of the arch.<br>
  There
  are thicker applications of shell gold (reminiscent of those on <em>Marriage </em> copy
  I [see article, pp. 89, 90]) to the left of Los's left knee and on
  the edge of the top of the lamp he is carrying; also on the inner edge of the
  right side of the arch and on the very right of the print to the right
  of Los's lamp. An "arc" of small specks of shell gold surrounding the lamp
forms a  halo. </p>
<p>Pl. 2<br>
  Shell gold has been applied in pen gilding the letters “Jerusalem”
  (but not on “The”); on “Ema” and the left-hand side of “n” (but not on “ation
  of”); not
  on “The”; only on “G” of “Giant”; only on “Albi” and on left-hand side of “o”;
  not on “n.” These details are only apparent in direct light (at YCBA, Department
  of Prints and Drawings, I saw them in bright "studio" conditions, under magnification,
  as I sat with a large window
  overlooking a fairly wide street to my left). Blake has evidently colored
  the remaining ungilded letters in a gold-looking yellow, which from a distance
  is fairly indistinguishable from the gold. This begs the question, first posed
  by Rosamund Paice (see article, p. 101): was Blake making a point or economizing?
  It is unclear (even under magnification) if the bottom inscription is in gold.
I doubt it.<br>
Minute dots and lines of shell gold, probably applied with a pen,
  are evident on the wings of the top right-hand figure and on the back of the
  headgear and at the nape of the neck of the figure middle left. In the latter
  case a series of small specks forms a pattern (as in pl. 1; see above). There
appears to be a speck of gold over the figure middle left's right eye.<br>
On the
grieving (?) figure, middle right, there are gold highlights, applied with a
pen, in her hair (?) trailing from the back of her hat and on wings. Gold is
similarly applied to highlight the ribbon or line on her mobcap/flower hat.
Shell gold is also present on the sun and crescent moon on her wings. Shell gold
applied with a pen is used to highlight the top half of her dress, as well
as the stars on the back of her dress (blue area of this garment).<br>
On the bottom
figure there is a profusion of carefully placed gold highlights in her hair,
similar to those in hair of the grieving (?) figure, middle right (see above).
There are also subtle touches of gold around the bottom figure's lower torso.
Quite thick curved lines of gold have been applied (one on either side) on her
upper wings. Shell gold has been used to outline the red circle on the upper-right
wing. There are touches of shell gold towards the edge of the wing nearest the
adjacent figure. On the middle section of the figure's right wing there are parallel
lines in gold applied in pen which appear to echo the effect of the line engraving
on the copperplate (apparent in the red edges of the bottom wing, almost certainly
the monochrome print media). Numerous stars on both lower wings have
been gilded in shell gold (this application of gold material over a blue watercolor
wash appears to parallel similar details on the bottom right figure's lower dress,
discussed above). There is evidence of gold material along the outer edge of
the bottom figure's right leg. On the middle area of her right wing (where her
body appears to merge into the wing) there are lines of gold, again probably
applied in pen. On the same wing, shell gold has been used to outline the circular area of
the moon in eclipse.</p>
<p>Pl. 23<br>
  In this plate there are seemingly indiscriminate
  applications of shell gold and perhaps shell silver in all three designs.<br>
  Top
    design: on the figure's left wing there is a fairly large patch of shell
  gold in the center, and two smaller specks (probably shell silver)
  of a lighter color immediately to its left. Smaller specks of the same lighter
color are apparent nearer the left tip of this wing.<br>
Middle design: a smear of light-colored
  shell gold to the left of the head of the smaller kneeling figure on the left.
  There is a hardly visible trace of light gold top right-hand side of the tree
  trunk base (?). In addition, there are specks of the same light gold on the
  left-hand side of the rock to the right of the large right-hand figure. On
  the right-hand side of the same rock (to the right of the small bald figure
  resting on his arm) there are faint touches of light gold towards the top of
the design and larger specks of dark gold towards the bottom.<br>
Bottom design: at
the top of the design a series of patches of thick dark gold interspersed with
four small patches of light gold. The very bottom of the design is highlighted
from the left to the center by a series of small patches of lighter gold: almost
a continuous line, followed by a large gap in the middle bottom. From middle
right bottom to right bottom smaller patches of light gold. Small specks of a
darker gold have been applied to the right-hand rock (to the right of the furthest
right-hand figure).</p>
<p>Pl. 25<br>
  Dark gold is very distinctly apparent under the
  left hand, arm and around the right flank of the top figure. This application appears to echo the effect of the red and blue covering
  or raining down on the left-hand female and male figure. The same material
  is particularly in evidence just above the male figure's left shoulder  and above his brow. Similar dark gold material is present just to the
  left of the left-hand figure's middle back and around the upper area of her
  right buttock above the rock. There is a tiny speck of light gold material
  on the top half of the rock she is sitting on; two specks of dark gold material
  toward the bottom of the rock; one on the edge of the rock where it begins
  to be obscured by shadow; one near the male figure's outer thigh (nearest the
  rock).|<br>
  Immediately below the rock there is a line of dark gold made of small
    patches (perhaps applied with a small dabber?). A few specks of the same color
    gold just below this. From below the male figure's left inner calf to the
    right-hand female figure's left toes are a series of patches of light and
    dark gold. Some light gold material is visible below the male figure's left
    foot. Dark gold material is visible near the right-hand figure's left heel.
    Light and dark gold patches are also visible on the top and right-hand edges
    of the hewn block the right-hand figure is sitting on. Tiny specks of gold
    material appear to be raining down from the top figure's left hand down the
  right figure's back.<br>
  Three small red-tinged specks of gold material, flame-like
  in shape, have been applied just above the right-hand figure's pubic region.
  These appear to echo the vegetal-looking lines in the background revealed in
  the space between her waist and the back of her upper left arm. </p>
<p>Pl. 47 <br>
  In the space between the right-hand figure's left
  hand and head there are specks of light gold material. Interestingly, there
  is also a larger patch of lighter gold in the same area, very close to the
  right-hand figure's head. Blake has glazed over this with blue watercolor,
  producing a silvery-blue effect (perhaps Blake glazing gold with a cooling
  color—giving the appearance of silver?—as noticed by Smith on <em>The
  Last Judgment</em>: see article, pp. 84-85). Light gold material has also
  been applied under both of the male figure's upper arms, especially the left
  one, enhancing his outline against the dark background. Also near the male
  figure's rump there is an extended patch of light gold. This emphasizes the adjacent
  shadow above it. There are extended patches of light gold material (on the
  left side) and dark gold material (on the right side) on the upper edges of
the object supporting the male figure. </p>
<p>Pl. 59 <br>
  Specks of gold material are apparent under the right
  arm of the left-hand figure, also to the left
  and right of her head. The same material has been applied around and within
  the spokes of both spinning wheels. A fairly large patch of gold material is
  visible directly above the right-hand spinning wheel. Two other patches of
  gold on either side of this wheel have a muddied look and appear to have mixed
  with the black ink or paint Blake has used to highlight the image. There are
  also patches of gold material above and under the arms of the middle female
  figure, as well as under the arm of the right-hand female figure. This figure
  also has a tiny speck of gold on her extended arm (compare to Robert N. Essick's mention
  of a similar application to the raised and extended arm of the standing figure
  in "The Divine Image," <em>Innocence</em> copy Y—see caption
  to illus. 4 in <em>Blake</em> 41.4 [spring 2008]: 146). All gold material on
  pl. 59 appears to be a lighter gold, though some applications appear
  to have reddish spots (perhaps Blake added red pigment to the shell gold)?</p>
<p>Pl. 75<br>
  Upper design: patches of gold material are visible
    at the intersections of the circles as well as around the heads of the angels.
    The application here seems rather patchy: perhaps some metal material has dislodged from the paper support. On the head of the fourth angel from the right there appear to
be traces of shell silver.<br>
Lower design: intermittent patches of gold material
    are visible on the outlines of the majority of circles on the coils of the
    creature surrounding the right-hand female's left thigh, as well as on the
    bottom half of the right-hand female herself. Gold material is also visible
    on and around the eyes of each of the reptile-like creatures (except the
    one bottom right). Gold material is present on the left-hand female
    figure's lower back and buttocks and on the scales below her buttocks. Also
    a large patch of gold is visible on the back of the neck of the third creature
from the left. </p>
<p>Pl. 76<br>
  On the small circles of round fruit under the trees/Jesus's arms, small patches
    of gold are visible, again a case of the material having become
    slightly "muddied" by the dark paint media it has
been applied to. </p>
<p>Pl. 81 <br>
  At the top of the clouds, dark and light thick gold
  patches are visible. Shell gold has been used to outline the edges of several
  clouds and to fill in the smaller spaces between the outlines. A dark shell
  gold is present in the bottom left-hand corner. Again, perhaps the material has mixed
with dark watercolor media.<br>
A thick application of gold is evident to the left
    of the left-hand figure's left arm and lower back. Intermittent thick applications
    of gold outline the clouds on either side of this figure, just below the
    text. Patches of light and dark gold are evident around the ball of her crossed
    left foot. A large patch of gold is visible beneath the arm of the bottom
right female as well as a small patch of gold on the head of the same figure. </p>
<p>Pl. 84<br>
  Gold is apparent on the setting sun on the horizon.
However, only a few patches have been used to highlight the sun. </p>
<p>Pl. 94 <br>
  Bottom design: specks of gold on the horizon are used
to indicate sunset (?).</p>
<p>Pl. 100<br>
  Gold material is evident at the center of the sun. Patches of gold are apparent running down the left
    flank of the left-hand figure extending from shoulder to toes (left-hand
  figure's left). A few specks are evident along his right leg. Specks and patches
  of light and dark colored gold are evident along the bottom of the tail of
  the Stonehenge table on the left. Similar patches are present on most of the
  base of Stonehenge. Several patches of gold are present on the top of the Stonehenge
    temple. The same material is also evident on the left-hand part of the bottom
    of the right-hand tail (rightmost ring?) of the temple. Patches of gold
    material are evident around the base of the right point of the tongs the middle figure holds in his left hand.
    Gold material is also present near the heels of both feet of the right-hand
    female. Finally, prominent patches of gold material are apparent along the
same figure's right hip. </p>
