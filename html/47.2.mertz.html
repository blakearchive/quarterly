<p class="title">The Responses of William Blake and Joseph Priestley to Two Swedenborgian Ideas</p>
<p class="byline">By J. B. Mertz</p>
<p class="note"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">J. B. Mertz</span> (<a href="mailto:jeffrey_mertz@hotmail.com">jeffrey_mertz@hotmail.com</a>)
 is an adjunct professor of English at Lindenwood University. He is 
currently preparing an article about Blake’s works of the mid-1790s and 
the publications of Joseph Johnson.</p>
</div>
<div id="text"> 
<p><span clas="notecall">As a “prerequisite to attendance”</span><span class="firstsidenote">I
 am grateful to G. E. Bentley, Jr., Bryonie Carter, Brendan Fleming, and
 this journal’s anonymous reader for their comments on a draft of this 
article.</span> at the general conference of the New Jerusalem Church in
 April 1789, William Blake and his wife, Catherine, signed a document 
stating the following:
</p><blockquote><span class="notecall">We whose Names are hereunto 
subscribed, do each of us approve of the Theological Writings of Emanuel
 Swedenborg, believing that the Doctrines contained therein are genuine 
Truths, revealed from Heaven, and that the New Jerusalem Church ought to
 be established, distinct and separate from the Old Church.</span><span class="sidenote">G. E. Bentley, Jr., <em>Blake Records</em>, 2nd ed. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) 50.</span></blockquote>
Given the Blakes’ association with the New Jerusalem Church in 1789, it 
is tempting to argue that the critique of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772)
 in <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> <span class="notecall">(possibly completed as early as the final months of 1790)</span><span class="sidenote">There is disagreement about the date of completion of <em>The Marriage</em>.
 The traditional dating of 1790-93 derives mainly from David Erdman’s 
argument regarding how Blake formed the lowercase letter “g” in various 
works (whether with a conventional ear or an idiosyncratic leftward ear 
on the upper bowl of the letter). See David V. Erdman, “Dating Blake’s 
Script: The ‘g’ Hypothesis,” <em>Blake</em> 3.1 (1969): 8-13. As Joseph Viscomi observes, <em>The Marriage</em>
 does not refer to literary works or historical events that can be dated
 later than 1790, and copy F contains Blake’s handwritten reference to 
the year 1790 above the text on plate 3. See Joseph Viscomi, <em>Blake and the Idea of the Book</em>
 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993) 233-34 and 237. Further 
arguments for 1790 as the year of completion can be found in Viscomi, 
“The Evolution of <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>,” <em>Huntington Library Quarterly</em> 58 (1997): 284-85; Viscomi, “The Lessons of Swedenborg; or, The Origin of William Blake’s <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>,” <em>Lessons of Romanticism: A Critical Companion</em>, ed. Thomas Pfau and Robert F. Gleckner (Durham: Duke University Press, 1998) 176-81; and William Blake, <em>The Early Illuminated Books</em>,
 ed. Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi (Princeton: 
Princeton University Press/William Blake Trust, 1993) 113-15. For a 
detailed argument that <em>The Marriage</em> “made its first public appearance in 1793 rather than 1790,” see William Blake, <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>, ed. with an introduction and commentary by Michael Phillips (Oxford: Bodleian Library, 2011) 32-44 (quotation at 42).</span> anticipates Joseph Priestley’s expostulation with the Swedenborgians in his <em>Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church</em>. <span class="notecall">(Priestley’s <em>Letters</em> were not published until the second half of 1791, delayed several weeks by the mob’s burning of his home in Birmingham.)</span><span class="sidenote">See Joseph Priestley, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OcgHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank"><em>Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church, Formed by Baron Swedenborg</em></a> (Birmingham, 1791) iv-v.</span> While Jon Mee has pointed out that Priestley’s <span class="notecall">“rationalism is often presented as making [him] irrelevant to Blake studies,”</span><span class="sidenote">Jon Mee, <em>Dangerous Enthusiasm: William Blake and the Culture of Radicalism in the 1790s</em> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992) 6.</span>
 I should like to explore what seem to be meaningful similarities 
between the responses of Blake and Priestley to specific details of 
Swedenborg’s writing.
<p><span class="notecall">An important early juxtaposition of <em>The Marriage</em> and Priestley appears in John Howard’s essay on Blake and Swedenborgianism: “<em>The Marriage</em>
 was not the sole attack on the Swedenborgians; Blake was joined by 
other members of the [Joseph] Johnson circle, and by Joseph Priestl[e]y 
in particular.”</span><span class="sidenote">John Howard, “An Audience for <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>,” <em>Blake Studies</em> 3 (1970): 23.</span> However, it might be more accurate to view <em>The Marriage</em>
 in the broader context of Priestley’s long-standing campaign against 
corruptions and error in Christianity, as Marilyn Butler proposes: <span class="notecall">“The satirical attack of <em>The Marriage</em>
 draws strength from the political, intellectual leadership offered by 
the whole of Priestley’s career, that thirty-year campaign in favour of 
individualism and against priestcraft, authority, and ‘corruptions.’”</span><span class="sidenote">Marilyn Butler, <em>Romantics, Rebels and Reactionaries: English Literature and Its Background, 1760-1830</em> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1981) 47.</span> <span class="notecall">Blake’s language in <em>The Marriage</em> does exhibit notable affinities with Priestley’s earlier <em>Disquisitions Relating to Matter and Spirit</em> (1777), as Morton Paley and Graham Pechey have observed.</span><a name="note7" id="note7"></a><span class="sidenote">Paley suggests that “Priestley’s denial of the dichotomy of soul and body” in <em>Disquisitions</em> is a view “very close” to that expressed by Blake’s “voice of the Devil” (<em>Energy and the Imagination: A Study of the Development of Blake’s Thought</em>
 [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1970] 8-9). Pechey traces Blake’s polemic 
“against the dichotomies of metaphysics which inform [Swedenborg’s] 
discourse” to <em>Disquisitions</em> (“<em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>: A Text and Its Conjuncture,” <em>Oxford Literary Review</em> 3 [1979]: 57).</span> In <em>Disquisitions</em> as well as <em>An History of the Corruptions of Christianity</em> (1782), Priestley argues against an immaterial soul existing independent of the body. <span class="notecall">He
 maintains that “we have no reason to suppose that there are in man two 
substances so distinct from each other” as “matter” and “spirit,” and 
seeks to demonstrate that “the doctrine of a <em>soul</em> is altogether unphilosophical, and unscriptural.”</span><span class="sidenote">Priestley, <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xSRIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Disquisitions Relating to Matter and Spirit</a>.
 To Which Is Added the History of the Philosophical Doctrine Concerning 
the Origin of the Soul, and the Nature of Matter; with Its Influence on 
Christianity, Especially with Respect to the Doctrine of the 
Pre-existence of Christ</em>, 2nd ed. (Birmingham, 1782) 1: ii, 270 (emphasis in original).</span> <span class="notecall">In both works, he suggests the derivative nature of the soul, i.e., he always speaks of the “soul distinct from the body,”</span><span class="sidenote">Priestley, <em>Disquisitions</em> 1: 271-72, 278. See also <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sqAUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">An History of the Corruptions of Christianity</a></em> (Birmingham, 1782) 1: 330, 345.</span> while in <em>The Marriage</em> <span class="notecall">Blake twice avers that man has no “body distinct from his soul,” as if partly affirming and partly amending Priestley.</span><span class="sidenote"><em>The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</em>, ed. David V. Erdman, newly rev. ed. (New York: Anchor–Random House, 1988) [hereafter “E”] 34, pl. 4, and 39, pl. 14.</span> <span class="notecall">Mee observes that “the proximity of [Priestley’s] language [in <em>Corruptions of Christianity</em>] to Blake’s on Plate 4 of <em>The Marriage</em> suggests that Priestley may well have been a direct source in this instance.”</span><span class="sidenote">Mee 138. It should be emphasized, however, that Blake may just as well have known these concepts from Priestley’s <em>Disquisitions</em>. See <a href="#note7">note 7</a>, above.</span></p>
<p>Notwithstanding critical observations of affinities between Blake’s 
and Priestley’s language, two Swedenborgian ideas to which Blake and 
Priestley both respond in <em>The Marriage</em> and <em>Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church</em> seem to have been overlooked: <span class="notecall">Swedenborg’s contention that there is no space in the spiritual world</span><span class="sidenote">See Emanuel Swedenborg, <em>The Wisdom of Angels, Concerning Divine Love and Divine Wisdom</em>, [trans. Nathaniel Tucker] (London, 1788) nn. 7-10 and 69-72. Blake’s annotations to these sections of <em>Divine Love and Divine Wisdom</em>
 do not indicate any immediate disagreement with Swedenborg’s ideas of 
space. Howard discusses Blake’s criticism of Swedenborg’s idea of space 
in connection with Priestley’s <em>Letters</em>, but solely in terms of Swedenborg’s ignorance of <em>Georgium Sidus</em> (the planet Uranus), which was discovered by William Herschel in 1781 (Howard 47-48).</span> <span class="notecall">and his claim to have seen God.</span><a name="note13" id="note13"></a><span class="sidenote">In an extract from <em>True Christian Religion</em>
 read at the opening of the general conference of the New Jerusalem 
Church, Swedenborg defends his “Memorable Relations” against the charge 
“that they are the Fictions of Imagination” by claiming, “it hath 
pleased the Lord to manifest Himself to me, and to send me to teach the 
Things relating to his New Church” (Anon., <em>Minutes of a General 
Conference of the Members of the New Church, Signified by the New 
Jerusalem in the Revelation: Held in Great East Cheap, London, from the 
13th to the 17th of April, 1789</em> [London, 1789] 16). See also proposition XL: “This Second Coming of the Lord is effected by Means of his Servant E<span style="font-variant:small-caps">manuel</span> S<span style="font-variant:small-caps">wedenborg</span>, before whom he hath manifested himself in Person” (<em>Minutes</em> 29).</span>
 In the fourth “Memorable Fancy,” after Blake’s narrating devil and his 
“friend the Angel” have visited “the infinite Abyss” and the mill at the
 end of a “church vault” (E 41-42, pls. 17-19), the devil proposes to 
show the angel his “eternal lot”:
</p><blockquote>he laughd at my proposal: but I by force suddenly caught
 him in my arms, &amp; flew westerly thro’ the night, till we were 
elevated above the earths shadow: then I flung myself with him directly 
into the body of the sun, here I clothed myself in white, &amp; taking 
in my hand Swedenborgs volumes sunk from the glorious clime, and passed 
all the planets till we came to saturn, here I staid to rest &amp; then 
leap’d into the void, between saturn &amp; the fixed stars.<br>
<span style="padding-left: 15px">Here said I! is your lot, in this space, if space it may be calld. (E 42, pl. 19)</span></blockquote>
The angel dismisses the episode as a “phantasy” imposed upon him (E 42, 
pl. 20), but Blake’s description of outer space, including “the earths 
shadow,” “the body of the sun,” “the planets,” “saturn,” and “the fixed 
stars,” together with his mocking reference to “space, if space it may 
be calld,” suggests the absurdity of Swedenborg’s claim that <span class="notecall">“in the spiritual world there are not spaces, but appearances of spaces.”</span><span class="sidenote">Swedenborg, <em>The Delights of Wisdom Respecting Conjugal Love. After Which Follow the Pleasures of Insanity Respecting Scortatory Love</em>, [trans. Henry Servanté] (London, 1790) n. 50.</span> Priestley answers Swedenborg’s claims respecting space by noting that <span class="notecall">“it is impossible for us to exclude the ideas of <em>space</em>, or <em>duration</em>”</span><span class="sidenote">Priestley, <em>Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church</em> 49 (emphasis in original).</span> from the idea of God, and also suggests that Swedenborg has mistaken his dreams for visions:
<blockquote><span class="notecall">His idea of there being no <em>space</em>
 in the spiritual world, but only the appearance of it, was suggested to
 him by what was represented to his mind in those visions. For, 
continuing in the same place, he fancied himself to be transported to a 
great distance, and after conversing with the inhabitants of one world, 
he sometimes instantly found himself in another. All this passing in his
 own mind, he naturally concluded, that the objects which seemed to 
occupy real space, in what he calls <em>the Spiritual World</em> … had no real bulk, but only the appearance of it.</span><span class="sidenote">Priestley, <em>Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church</em> 52 (emphasis in original).</span></blockquote>
While Blake bluntly ridicules Swedenborg and Priestley attempts to 
account rationally for Swedenborg’s claim, both nonetheless identify as 
problematic a specific idea in Swedenborg’s writing.
<p>Although the similarity with Priestley is somewhat weaker in this 
instance, the discussion between Blake’s devil and the prophets seems to
 answer the claim that God <span class="notecall">“hath manifested himself in Person” to Swedenborg.</span><span class="sidenote">See <a href="#note13">note 13</a>, above.</span> In <em>The Marriage</em>, Blake’s narrator demands of Ezekiel and Isaiah
</p><blockquote>how they dared so roundly to assert. that God spake to 
them; and whether they did not think at the time, that they would be 
misunderstood, &amp; so be the cause of imposition.
<span style="padding-left: 15px">Isaiah answer’d. I saw no God. nor 
heard any, in a finite organical perception; but my senses discover’d 
the infinite in every thing. (E 38, pl. 12)</span></blockquote>
To assert that God “spake” to the prophets is obviously not the same 
thing as Swedenborg’s claim, but in both cases God communicates 
personally and directly with man. <span class="notecall">In his <em>Letters</em>, Priestley reprints without comment an extract from <em>A Short Account of the Honourable Emanuel Swedenborg</em> (1787) in which Swedenborg says that “the Lord himself … was graciously pleased to manifest himself to me.”</span><span class="sidenote">Priestley, <em>Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church</em> xvi-xvii.</span> Elsewhere in the <em>Letters</em>, <span class="notecall">Priestley states the Unitarian belief that God is “invisible and omnipresent” and “not the object of any of our senses.”</span><span class="sidenote">Priestley, <em>Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church</em> 63, 61.</span>
 Blake’s manner of articulating his idea of God obviously differs from 
Priestley’s more temperate expression, yet Isaiah’s claim that God 
cannot be seen “in a finite organical perception” but rather as “the 
infinite in every thing” invites comparison with Priestley’s “invisible 
and omnipresent” God. Ultimately, however, it is important to bear in 
mind the essential difference between Blake and Priestley. <span class="notecall">It should be noted that Priestley’s overall purpose in his <em>Letters</em> is to emphasize what Unitarianism and Swedenborgianism have in common</span><span class="sidenote">See Priestley, <em>Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church</em> 2: “We are even agreed with respect to many of the most important particulars of the corruptions of christian doctrine.”</span> and to persuade Swedenborgians to become Unitarians. Blake criticizes Swedenborg as insufficiently visionary, <span class="notecall">while
 Priestley finds fault with the irrational aspects of Swedenborg’s 
writings and entreats Swedenborgians to “re-examine these things, and 
believe no man in contradiction to your own reason.”</span><span class="sidenote">Priestley, <em>Letters to the Members of the New Jerusalem Church</em> 61.</span> Priestley <span class="notecall">would also have been uncomfortable with the visionary dimensions of <em>The Marriage</em>.</span><span class="sidenote">See Michael Scrivener, “A Swedenborgian Visionary and <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>,” <em>Blake</em> 21.3 (winter 1987-88): 102: “The <em>Marriage</em>
 runs counter in essential ways to the Rational Dissent of the Johnson 
circle” and “positions itself against … Priestley,” particularly on 
account of “Rational Dissent’s hostility to all varieties of ‘religious 
enthusiasm.’”</span>
<p><span class="notecall">Butler is correct to point out that “Blake’s quarrel with the Swedenborgians is far less doctrinal than Priestley’s.”</span><span class="sidenote">Butler 47.</span>
 Although Blake and Priestley do not agree exactly in their responses to
 Swedenborg’s assertions, together they resist Swedenborg as a potential
 “cause of imposition” (E 38, pl. 12) and source of further corruptions 
of Christianity. It should come as no surprise that Blake may have had 
Priestley’s writings in mind while he worked on <em>The Marriage</em>, given Priestley’s stature and intellectual prestige among the authors published by Joseph Johnson <span class="notecall">(for whom Blake produced eighty-three engravings during the period 1790-95).</span><span class="sidenote">See Bentley 817-19.</span>
 I acknowledge patent differences in social standing between Priestley 
(a prominent scientist, philosopher, biblical scholar, and theologian) 
and Blake (an obscure engraver, printmaker, artist, and poet), but I 
suggest that the two men are not so far apart in ideas as modern 
scholarship would sometimes have us believe. That is not to say that 
Priestley’s writings alone could have informed Blake’s response to 
Swedenborg in <em>The Marriage</em>, but given their shared professional
 associations in the Johnson circle, such similarities in their writings
 seem more than merely coincidental.</p>
