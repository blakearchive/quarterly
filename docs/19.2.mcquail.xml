          <p>On a particularly gloomy winter day in 1984 I attempted to cheer myself up by
			a visit to my friend John Guillot’s bookstore in Charlottesville,
			Virginia. John, now the proprietor of Magnum Opus in Charlottesville,
			usually had some tempting volume in the antiquarian section of Heartwood
			Books, which he managed then. That day he came up with a first edition of S.
			Foster Damon’s <hi rend="i">William Blake: His Philosophy and
				Symbols</hi>, in which, he said, there was an amusing poem inscribed by
			the author. Sure enough, the flyleaf traced a mysterious exchange involving
			this book, which fell eventually into its author’s hands. The book
			bears several bookplates, including one of “Richard and Caroline
			Hogue,” and Damon predicated the poem: 
			<q> From Caroline Hogue<lb/>
				to S. Foster Damon<lb/>
				and back again<lb/>
				April 29, 1941 </q>
			The poem
			itself reveals S. Foster Damon’s sense of humor, which is quite
			refreshing! He imagined that 
			<q> Hamlet once met William Blake<lb/>
			They chatted, for politeness’ sake.<lb/>
			Said Hamlet: “Do you see that cloud?”<lb/>
			Said William: “Yes! It is a crowd<lb/>
			Of Seraphim shouting ‘Glory! Hail!’ ”<lb/>
			Said Hamlet: “No. It’s like a whale.”<lb/>
			And so they parted, each one glad<lb/>
			that the other, and not he, was mad. </q>
			The readers of <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>
			will understand why I immediately purchased the book. I am happy to share it
			with the readers of the <hi rend="i">Quarterly</hi>, and I would like to
			thank Morton Paley for suggesting that I submit the poem to <hi rend="i">Blake</hi>, and Catherine Brown,
S. Foster Damon’s literary
			executor, for giving permission to print it.</p>
