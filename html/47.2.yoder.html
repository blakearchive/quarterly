<p class="byline">Reviewed by R. Paul Yoder</p>
<p class="note"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">R. Paul Yoder</span> (<a href="mailto:rpyoder@ualr.edu">rpyoder@ualr.edu</a>)
 is a professor of English at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.
 He is the author of articles on Milton, Alexander Pope, Samuel 
Richardson, Thomas Gray, Blake, and Wordsworth.  His book, <em>The Narrative Structure of William Blake’s Poem</em> Jerusalem: <em>A Revisionist Interpretation</em>, was published by the Edwin Mellen Press in 2010.  He has also co-edited, with Wallace Jackson, two essay collections on Pope.</p>
</div>
<div class="text">
<p>Every reader brings his or her own strengths to Blake’s <em>Jerusalem</em>. Susanne Sklar’s strength lies in her biblical and theological background, and in <em>Blake’s </em>Jerusalem<em> as Visionary Theatre: Entering the Divine Body</em>,
 she identifies an extensive range of biblical references and echoes in 
Blake’s masterpiece, while she also embeds the poem in the context of 
various eighteenth-century social and religious movements, including 
Freemasonry, Moravianism, and the Messianism of Joanna Southcott. Sklar 
also wants to use the notion of “visionary theatre” to show that <em>Jerusalem</em>
 can be read both synchronically (holistically, like a painting) and 
diachronically (for its story and plot). However, she is more successful
 at deploying the biblical and theological context than with applying 
the visionary theatre aspect, and the result is a discussion without a 
clear overall thesis.</p>
<p>It is worth noting at the outset that Sklar uses copy E of <em>Jerusalem</em> as the base text for her reading, rather than the more commonly used copy A. As most readers know, <em>Jerusalem</em>
 exists in two forms: copies A, C, and F exhibit one sequence of plates 
in chapter 2, while copies D and E exhibit another. For many years, 
David Erdman’s edition of Blake’s work has been the standard critical 
text, and since he uses the A-C-F sequence, most discussions of <em>Jerusalem</em> have been based on that. <span class="notecall">However, twenty years ago, Joseph Viscomi showed that the copy D-E sequence is in fact Blake’s final intention for the poem.</span><span class="sidenote">Joseph Viscomi, <em>Blake and the Idea of the Book</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993) 339-41.</span>
 Nonetheless, the ready availability and authority of Erdman’s edition 
have meant that most work on the poem is still based on the A-C-F 
sequence. Thus Sklar’s decision reflects a shift in the textual 
assumptions underpinning critical approaches to the poem. This shift has
 been encouraged by the increasing availability of facsimiles of copy E,
 both in the Blake Trust edition of 1991 and in the online <em>Blake Archive</em>.
 Indeed, Sklar suggests that the reader keep the facsimile open while 
reading her commentary. This advice is useful because she makes more 
effort than most to integrate interpretations of the illuminations with 
the interpretations of the text. Also, much of her commentary refers to 
conversations she had about the illuminations with other scholars while 
working with copy E itself at the Yale Center for British Art.</p>
<p>The book opens with an introduction that includes what is now a fairly standard review of the literary criticism of <em>Jerusalem</em>.
 She covers most of the important critics (Ellis and Yeats, Gilchrist, 
Damon, Frye, Erdman, Wittreich, Mitchell, Paley, Doskow, Witke, and 
Dortort), as well as some more theologically oriented writers such as J.
 G. Davies and Thomas Altizer, and a good number of others. After the 
introduction, the book is divided into two major parts: Part I: 
Perspectives, Characters, Settings, and Part II: The Commentary. Part I 
introduces the notion of “Visionary Theatre” and the related issue of 
“Dramatis Personae” before focusing more specifically on “Jerusalem: Her
 Character and Context,” “<em>Jerusalem</em>’s Jesus,” and “Shifting 
Settings—Building Projects.” Part II offers a chapter-by-chapter 
discussion of Blake’s poem, leading up to an “Encore” that somewhat 
belatedly returns to the issue of the synchronic reading of <em>Jerusalem</em>.</p>
<p>Part I sets up an admirable context that promises much for the more 
detailed reading of the poem. The strengths here lie in the extensive 
detail that Sklar brings to the context she creates for the poem. For 
example, like Morton Paley and Vincent De Luca, she makes much of the 
influence of Joseph Mede’s <em>Clavis Apocalyptica</em> (<em>Key to the Revelation</em>) on <em>Jerusalem</em>,
 partly by way of Milton. Paley cites in general terms Joseph 
Wittreich’s work on Mede’s influence on Milton, but Sklar includes the 
juicy tidbit that Mede was “one of [Milton’s] Cambridge tutors” and that
 <em>Clavis Apocalyptica</em> was published “during Milton’s second year
 at Christ’s College” (22). Similarly, while the influence of 
Freemasonry on Blake has been discussed by earlier critics such as 
Stuart Peterfreund, Sklar emphasizes the influence via Blake’s master 
during his apprenticeship, James Basire, noting both the assertion by 
Hamill and Gilbert that “Basire was ‘certainly a member of the Craft’” 
(although she admits to having found “no documentary evidence to support
 this”) (36) and the fact that the dedication and consecration of the 
Freemasons’ Tavern and Hall were “done with pomp and circumstance 
directly opposite Basire’s studio and home on Great Queen Street” (37). 
In her examination of the character of Jerusalem, Sklar compares her to 
Christ, while also creating a context for Blake’s depiction that 
includes Jacob Boehme’s Sophia and the evangelist Southcott. In 
discussing Blake’s Jesus, she examines the similarities and differences 
between Blake’s poem and Edward Young’s <em>Night Thoughts</em>, the epistles of St. Paul, the Moravian Church, and the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg.</p>
<p>It is in Sklar’s focus on visionary theatre that her book holds the 
most promise. The synchronic readings that have dominated criticism of <em>Jerusalem</em>
 for years commonly invoke the notion of “visionary theatre” as it was 
applied to Revelation by David Pareus and Mede in the seventeenth 
century, but these approaches are now being called into question by a 
variety of critics (including myself). Sklar states early that 
“visionary theatre allows us to engage with Blake’s composite art both 
sequentially and synchronically” (3). This effort to bring the 
synchronic and diachronic readings into interplay is an important focus 
for future discussions of <em>Jerusalem</em>: it has become increasingly
 clear that the synchronic approach does not address important issues in
 the poem, such as what constitutes a synchronic fragment, or why Blake 
oscillated between two different sequences in chapter 2. Nonetheless, 
the synchronic readings cannot simply be dismissed, and at least early 
in her book, Sklar tries harder than most to bring the synchronic and 
diachronic possibilities of <em>Jerusalem</em> into proximity. Moreover,
 she rightly argues that the emphasis on visionary theatre should draw 
the reader’s attention to issues of character, motive, dramatic scene or
 episode, and setting, elements often ignored in the drive to read <em>Jerusalem</em> as a set of synchronic fragments of a single event.</p>
<p>Despite Sklar’s intent to engage the poem both sequentially and 
synchronically, her discussion in part I of the characters and their 
relationships tends to collapse Blake’s time scheme in a way that 
finally misrepresents the drama and action of the poem. For example, she
 describes the “erotic spirituality” of Jesus in <em>Jerusalem</em>, 
saying that Jerusalem (the character) “flies into the arms of her 
bridegroom, who makes her his wife (J20:35-41), and they experience 
‘holy raptures’ on their heavenly couch in their ‘secret chamber’ in 
Spain, spreading joy throughout the world (J79)” (107). Sklar is 
certainly correct that Blake connected eroticism and spirituality, and 
the two quotations she cites are textually accurate, but those 
quotations come from scenes at opposite ends of the poem. Moreover, her 
description ignores the dramatic context because the actions she 
specifies do not happen in the narrative present of the poem. On plate 
20, Jerusalem does say that “The Lamb of God … made me his Bride &amp; 
Wife” (20.39-40), but this statement occurs in the middle of a scene in 
which Jerusalem and Vala are talking about sin, guilt, and forgiveness, 
including the latter’s response to what may have been a rape by Albion, 
as Jerusalem describes to Vala how he “rent thy Veil,” yet “thou 
forgavest his furious love” (20.36-37). Similarly, in the second scene 
noted by Sklar in this passage, Jerusalem does describe her love with 
the Saviour, but again, that scene is not in the narrative present. 
Instead, on plate 79 Jerusalem describes her situation in terms 
recalling Ezekiel’s account of the Babylonian exile, especially Ezekiel 
chapter 33, in which he reports the destruction of the city of 
Jerusalem. Jerusalem’s statements depict that time when she was happier,
 before the destruction of the city and the exile of the people. Within 
the context of the poem, Sklar’s statements about these relationships 
focus on the lost past and a possible future, but not the situation that
 confronts Blake’s characters in the drama of <em>Jerusalem</em>’s visionary theatre.</p>
<p>The problem is that Sklar lacks an adequate working definition of 
“visionary theatre.” She devotes an early chapter to “Visionary 
Theatre—Apocalyptic Images,” in which she brings together with Pareus 
and Mede the book of Revelation, musicals, alchemy, Boehme, Freemasonry,
 and Blake’s oft-noted reference to “Sublime Allegory” (see his letter 
to Thomas Butts of 6 July 1803) to construct a web of possible 
connections and influences. However, she is more interested in the 
“visionary” than the “theatre.” She is more concerned with the 
possibility of seeing past, present, and future all at once (22) and 
with the characters as “windows to eternity” (43) than with identifying 
theatrical scenes that unfold a plot in a narrative present. Following 
the chapter on visionary theatre, the bulk of part I is largely a matter
 of definitions, using Jerusalem, Jesus, and Blake’s cosmology to 
introduce key terms and motifs in the poem. That makes a good 
introduction, even though there is little consideration of the details 
of the development of the drama. We expect that those details will come 
in “The Commentary” of part II.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they do not. Part II should explain how the concept of
 visionary theatre helps the reader to identify and interpret individual
 scenes and their interrelationships. Instead, the concept mainly serves
 to authorize a variety of theatrical metaphors (overture, encore, 
curtain call). Ideas about dramatic context, characterization, and 
motive introduced in part I, ideas that should be clarified and 
crystallized in their application to the sequential details of the poem,
 are left vague and ill defined. In part II Sklar provides summaries of 
what the characters say without much attention to who is speaking to 
whom, where, when, and why. In part I, following the four-point outline 
of Revelation suggested by Pareus, Sklar does say,
</p><blockquote>When I apply these “vision-divisions” to <em>Jerusalem</em>
 I see the structure of its story: Chapter One depicts the calamity of 
Albion rejecting the Saviour’s song and Jerusalem’s love; in Chapter 
Two, Albion’s cities, friends, and immortals offer comforts; in Chapter 
Three, calamities amplify … and in Chapter Four, the Spectrous Selfhood,
 or “Anti-christ accursed” (J89:10) is overcome. (21)</blockquote>
She repeats this outline several times throughout the book, but we 
hardly need Pareus, Mede, or any of the modern critics she mentions to 
grasp this general chain of events. When Sklar gets down to the 
particulars of the drama, she divides <em>Jerusalem</em>’s chapters 1 
and 4 into six scenes, and chapters 2 and 3 into seven scenes (plus a 
preface and “interval” for each chapter), but she does not explain her 
rationale for these divisions, nor does she consider more than in 
passing how one set of events relates to the ones that come before and 
after it. Part II is basically a paraphrase of the actions described by 
the characters in the text; it is not an analysis of those conversations
 as dramatic events.
<p>Sklar provides a fairly detailed sequential summary of the poem, but 
she does not explain what defines the dramatic scenes she uses in that 
summary. Without a sense of what constitutes a scene change, she fails 
to consider how the action of the drama develops. For example, she 
offers fairly extensive discussions of the final scenes in Beulah in 
chapters 1 and 2 of <em>Jerusalem</em>, but she makes no comment on the 
similarity or difference between the cry from Beulah asking the “Lamb of
 God” to “take away the imputation of Sin” in chapter 1 (25.12) and the 
cry from Beulah in chapter 2 for the “Lamb of God” to “take away the 
remembrance of Sin” (50.24, 30). Similarly, she does not comment on the 
increase in the arrogance and power of the Spectre evident in the change
 from his self-identification—“I am your Rational Power”—in chapter 2, 
where he is merely “Worshipd as God” (33.5, 18), to his claim in chapter
 3 that “I am God” (54.16). It is in these sorts of progressions that 
the details of <em>Jerusalem</em>’s unfolding drama are most evident. 
Thus she dismisses as “banal bickering” the important scene in chapter 4
 in which the problems of jealousy finally infiltrate into Los’s own 
family, despite the fact that the scene parallels Jerusalem’s taking of 
the foaming cup from Vala and immediately precedes Los’s consolidation 
of error that culminates in the awakening of Albion. That scene is not 
banal; it is the climax of the poem.</p>
<p>Sklar’s book is a valuable resource for the “prophetic, poetic, and historical sources” (43) informing <em>Jerusalem</em>;
 I would add theological sources as well. But the book is also a missed 
opportunity to tell us something even more valuable about the structure 
of Blake’s masterpiece. Sklar does stipulate at the beginning of her 
part II, “I am not <em>arguing</em> that <em>Jerusalem</em> is visionary
 theatre or creating a theory about it; I am using this notion as an 
approach to the text, an imaginative way of reading that clarifies how 
characters, settings, imagery, and action interrelate” (148). I’m just 
not convinced that’s enough. Her theatrical metaphors do (or should) 
carry meaningful implications for the text to which they are applied. 
Why is “visionary theatre” a better way to approach the poem than some 
other? I’m still not sure.</p>
