      <p>A notice in the online news section of <em>Blake</em> in September 2011 informed about an in-progress translation of <em>Jerusalem</em> into Polish by Rafał Stankiewicz and me. Going against the Polish tradition (which has by now become a habit) of publishing <em>Jerusalem</em>
 only in the form of selected fragments, we desire to present to the 
Polish-speaking public the entire “golden string,” giving this string as
 Blakean a gloss as possible and building a <em>Jerusalem</em> that will
 be a faithful replica of the original. The purpose of this essay is to 
elaborate upon these metaphors. I would like to explain the motivation 
behind our project, speak about the obstacles, and share the 
encouragements, establishing a context for this testimony of a builder 
of a replica with some reflections concerning the history of Polish 
Blake translations.</p>
<p><span class="notecall">It will be fair to begin by stating that 
Blake’s name sounds relatively familiar to Polish ears and by 
acknowledging that popularizing Blake in Poland has been and remains his
 translators’ job.</span><span class="sidenote">One may object that 
perhaps this modest popularity derives partly from the fact that, due to
 the political changes of the last decades, more and more Poles know 
English. But most of them certainly do not know it well enough to cope 
with poetry, and those who do have invested their time and money in 
learning English for social and economic reasons, very often in order to
 obtain jobs that leave them no time for poetry. More often than not, 
genuine poetry readers begin with translations. It is acquaintance with a
 Polish version, sometimes a variety of Polish versions, that eventually
 provokes those readers who have some command of English to reach for 
the original text, to confront the challenge that faced the translators.</span>
 Over the decades, Blake’s poetry has attracted many Polish people of 
talent, including poets of the highest esteem, such as Leopold Staff, 
Jan Kasprowicz, Czesław Miłosz, Zygmunt Kubiak, and Stanisław Barańczak.
 <span class="notecall">Their translations have been published in 
anthologies (of English poetry, or English and American poetry, or 
romantic poetry, or religious poetry) as well as in volumes dedicated to
 Blake alone.</span><span class="sidenote">For details, see <a href="#references">references</a>
 under Krzeczkowski et al., Miłosz, Pietrkiewicz, Kubiak (1991 and 
1993), Barańczak (1992 and 1993), Puławski, and Fostowicz (1998 and 
2007).</span> As a result, a great number of works have been given Polish versions.</p>
<p>	In fact, some of Blake’s works have received more than one version. This applies particularly to shorter pieces, including <em>Poetical Sketches</em> and <em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em>, as well as several minor prophecies, such as <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>, <em>The Book of Thel</em>, and <em>The First Book of Urizen</em>. A similar profusion of translations has been generated by selected passages from Blake’s major prophecies. <span class="notecall">The most notable example is the preface to <em>Milton</em> (pl. 1).</span><span class="sidenote">Plate numbers and quotations from Blake’s works follow Erdman, unless otherwise indicated.</span>
 In the anthology edited by Puławski (1997), the preface, translated by 
Jolanta Kozak, is followed by her translations of pls. 2-4 (144-55), 
and, curiously enough, preceded by another version of “And did those 
feet …” (143), by Puławski himself. <span class="notecall">In other words, in an anthology which gives no samples of <em>The Four Zoas</em> or <em>Jerusalem</em>,</span><span class="sidenote">The lack of any passage representing <em>Jerusalem</em>
 is particularly striking in this anthology, as its introduction begins 
with a reference to the work: the first sentence states, “In his <em>Jerusalem</em>,
 Blake writes the words that could be regarded as a motto for his entire
 work: ‘I must Create a System, or be enslav’d by another Mans’” (5; my 
translation of the Polish text).</span>  and only a very brief sample of <em>Milton</em>,
 there are two translations of the preface’s famous lyric. The same is 
true of Kubiak’s anthology (1991), which gives no passages from <em>The Four Zoas</em> or <em>Jerusalem</em> and no extracts from <em>Milton</em>,
 with the exception of “And did those feet …” (147). Again, the lyric, 
along with the rest of the preface, is the only extract from <em>Milton</em>
 included in a more recent selection from Blake’s poems and writings, 
compiled and translated by Polish artist and Blake scholar Michał 
Fostowicz (87-88 [2007]).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The situation of <em>Milton</em> changed radically in 2001, when 
Wiesław Juszczak, one of the most distinguished Polish critics and Blake
 scholars, published his translation of the whole prophecy. It is a 
brilliant work, though it has one questionable feature: Juszczak seems 
to have attempted to render Blake’s sublime and pathos by imitating the 
style of one of the leading Polish romantic poets, Juliusz Słowacki. The
 result is that the Polish&nbsp;<em>Milton</em> sounds more like 
Słowacki than Blake, though this weak point may also be seen as a strong
 point: it refers the reader to the epoch when the original was created 
and, apart from that, it constitutes an integrated stylistic choice, 
whose greatest appeal is its beauty. However, no matter how one assesses
 the content and form of Juszczak’s translation, the very fact that he 
decided to translate and publish the entire work cannot be 
overestimated. It has value in itself, because every post-Juszczak 
translator of a fragment from <em>Milton</em> is no longer involved in 
the fragmentation of the prophecy. After Juszczak, a new translation of a
 fragment (such as Fostowicz’s version of the preface from 2007) becomes
 simply a new example of how <em>Milton</em>’s idiom can be rendered; it enriches the ways in which Blake can be naturalized into Polish without disintegrating his thought.</p>
<p>The same applies to <em>The Four Zoas</em>, which was translated and 
published in its entirety in 2006 by one of the most respected Polish 
translators, Maciej Słomczyński (who had earlier translated, among other
 things, all the theatrical works of Shakespeare, Milton’s&nbsp;<em>Paradise Lost</em>,&nbsp;and Joyce’s&nbsp;<em>Ulysses</em>).
 Again, with the entire text available in Polish, publication of 
fragments, such as the selection offered by Fostowicz in 2007 (68-85), 
no longer means that the translator carries on the work of 
fragmentation. His work becomes a new instance of how individual phrases
 or paragraphs or pages could or should be understood. In brief, 
publication of a translation of the whole opens up a field for 
debate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no such field has been opened up to now as far as <em>Jerusalem </em>is
 concerned. No interpretative or artistic dialogue relating to what 
Blake called his&nbsp; “consolidated” work is possible, because it 
exists in Polish only in the form of pathetically disheveled fragments. 
Probably the first poet to publish a translation of a fragment was 
Kubiak, whose version of pls. 34[38].7-35[39].3 was included in <em>Poeci języka angielskiego</em> [<em>Poets of the English Language</em>]
 (Krzeczkowski et al. 151-54 [1971]). Miłosz, the first Polish poet to 
receive the Nobel Prize for Literature (1980), included a large part of 
“To the Christians” in his volume of translations entitled <em>Mowa wiązana </em>[<em>Poetic Speech</em>] (1986). The last decade was a little more favorable for <em>Jerusalem</em> (though not as constructive as it was for Blake’s other major prophecies), especially thanks to Fostowicz, who included in his <em>Wiersze i pisma Williama Blake’a</em> [<em>Poems and Writings of William Blake</em>]
 (2007) the largest selection so far: pls. 1, 3, 10.7-15.20, 16.61-69, 
27, 38[43].1-54, 42.19-46, 52, 70.1-71.9, 74.1-13, 77 (in its entirety),
 84.29-85.13, 90.1-91.30, and 94.1-99.5 (90-136).</p>
<p>Apart from this, dozens or indeed hundreds of lines have been 
translated to illustrate books about Blake written in or translated into
 Polish. During the last, most fruitful decade, a great number of minute
 quotations from <em>Jerusalem</em> were included in Fostowicz’s latest (and last) book, <em>Boska analogia</em> [<em>Divine Analogy</em>] (2008); more than fifty percent coincide with those selected for his <em>Wiersze i pisma Williama Blake’a</em>,
 published a year earlier, while the rest are translations of other bits
 and pieces from the prophecy. More fragments, or sometimes other 
translations of the same fragments, can be found in a massive book 
published in 2001, <span class="notecall"><em>U‑bywać. Człowiek, świat, przyjaźń w twórczości Williama Blake’a</em> [<em>The Man, the World, and Friendship in the Work of William Blake</em>],</span><span class="sidenote">The main title, <em>U‑bywać</em>, is a pun suggesting contact with others (bywać u) as a means of the annihilation of the self (ubywać).</span>
 by probably the&nbsp;most recognizable Polish&nbsp;Blake scholar, 
Tadeusz Sławek. Another group appears in one of the very few 
translations of Blake-related books into Polish, Peter Ackroyd’s <em>Blake</em>,
 which was translated by Ewa Kraskowska and published in 2001. To read 
these fragments is the most disheartening of experiences. In choosing 
extracts for his Blake anthology, Fostowicz could at least claim that he
 “tried to select key … fragments of bigger wholes [including <em>Jerusalem</em>]
 and put them together in a way that will make it possible for the 
uninitiated to understand the basic ideas [of Blake’s thought] and walk 
efficiently along his labyrinth” (foreword, p. 5 [2007]; translation 
mine). But, understandably, no such claims can be made in his <em>Boska analogia</em> or any other critical book; the fragments are of course random, they follow the critic’s argument, not <em>Jerusalem</em>’s,
 and they are, naturally, meant to guide the reader along Fostowicz’s, 
or Sławek’s, or Ackroyd’s labyrinth, not Blake’s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the outcomes of this situation is that Blake’s thought gets 
explained for the Polish reader without the reader’s having any real 
chance to know Blake himself. Another is the false impression that the 
reader may derive from encountering <em>Jerusalem</em> in the form of a 
disorganized mass. Now and then, for example, the reader will find in 
this jumble of fragments quotations saying that “Jerusalem lies in 
ruins,” and indeed there is nothing to counteract the impression that 
she/it really does. A third consequence is that no tradition of 
translating <em>Jerusalem</em> into Polish has a chance of taking root 
in such ground. A telling illustration is Kraskowska’s translation of 
Ackroyd. Undertaking the rare job of translating rather than writing a 
Blake-related book, she uses translations that existed at the time, 
quoting, for example, Kubiak’s translations of fragments of “To the 
Evening Star” (68), <em>An Island in the Moon</em> (105), and <em>The Book of Thel</em> (134), as well as the entire “The Chimney Sweeper” of <em>Innocence</em> (143) and all of <span class="notecall">“The Tyger” (168),</span><span class="sidenote">A
 curious detail is that Kraskowska does not limit herself to one 
translation of the poem, quoted by Ackroyd at the beginning of chapter 
14, but provides as many as four (168-69): Kubiak’s version is followed 
by Barańczak’s, and then by two translations from Puławski’s anthology, 
one by Puławski and the other by Kozak.</span> available in Kubiak’s anthologies of 1991 and 1993. As I said above, Kubiak also translated pls. 34[38].7-35[39].3 of <em>Jerusalem</em>,
 from which Ackroyd quotes several times. Yet this time the translator 
does not use Kubiak but translates the lines she needs herself, probably
 because the passage, for some reason not included in Kubiak’s 
anthologies from the 1990s, exists only in the form of a disconnected 
fragment in <em>Poeci języka angielskiego</em> of 1971 (Krzeczkowski et 
al. 151-54) and is too short for her to bother to recover the 
translation. If the translation of Ackroyd’s book were made now, ten 
years later, the translator would be in a much more comfortable 
position; apart from the shorter pieces which were available in 2001, 
she would have the entire text of <em>Milton</em> and <em>The Four Zoas</em> to take from. But as far as <em>Jerusalem</em> is concerned, she would probably take the passages collected by Fostowicz in his <em>Wiersze i pisma Williama Blake’a</em> and translate all the other passages herself, rather than scan Fostowicz’s critical <em>Boska analogia</em> (which, by the way, provides translations of much higher quality than those in his anthology of 2007) or <em>U‑bywać</em>
 by Sławek (a hugely competent Blake scholar and a poet to boot) in the 
hope that, perhaps, there is some coincidence in the fragments that a 
Polish critic and the English author needed to illustrate their 
arguments.</p>
<p>All in all, putting together the fragments scattered in selections 
from Blake and in Blake criticism, well over a thousand lines of <em>Jerusalem</em>
 have been translated into Polish, about a quarter of the text (roughly 
the equivalent of one chapter). Some lines have been translated more 
than once, and thousands have never been translated. Having invested 
several years in the task of creating the first Polish translation of 
the entire prophecy along with Rafał Stankiewicz—a Polish poet and 
philologist, and a devoted Blake student—I could provide a long 
catalogue of challenges, very often frustrations, on the translator’s 
way. But let me limit myself to a handful of examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polish words tend to be longer than English. For instance, Life, 
Love, Good, Hate, Form, Wheel, Shell, Void, Space, Earth, Sun, Moon, 
Man, Heart, Womb, One, Lamb, and hundreds of other one-syllable keywords
 of <em>Jerusalem</em> are two- or three-syllable words in Polish, and 
in certain grammatical cases or in the plural they often become three or
 even four syllables. This is, of course, bad for the rhythmicality of 
the text, and it is even worse for its length. As a result, though the 
translator must repeat after Blake the assertions of “To the Public” 
concerning the “cadences” and “number of syllables,” there is very 
little chance that there will be correspondence between the original and
 the translation in this respect. In a different text you might consider
 removing individual words for the sake of rhythm and brevity, but you 
dare not do this in a text that, in the same paragraph of “To the 
Public,” asserts that “every word and every letter is studied and put 
into its fit place.” You can likewise experiment with synonyms, 
searching for a Polish word whose rhythm and length will be nearer the 
English original. But it is exactly when you start doing this that you 
appreciate how direct Blake is in his choice of vocabulary. He is not 
Milton, he does not rely on Latinate diction or rhetoric; his words 
cannot be translated with the use of less obvious synonyms, with 
something of foreign derivation, or something slightly more archaic. 
Once this is done what gets affected is the most vital feature of the 
original: its directness, its fiery energy, its elemental power.</p>
<p>Even more crucially, the rhythm—the palpable beat of English, its 
play between the strong and the weak, the stressed and the unstressed—is
 an attribute that does not have an equivalent in Polish. The Polish 
language has stressed and unstressed syllables, but what is stressed is 
not that strong, what is unstressed not so weak and, as a result, even 
if the translator manages to recreate the rhythm, it will never attack 
the Polish ear as much as the original attacks the English ear. Of 
course these difficulties confront every translator of English verse 
into Polish, but the specific difficulty of <em>Jerusalem</em> is that 
the beat is part of the meaning. Los is a blacksmith, his sense is the 
ear, his tool is the hammer (“The blow of his Hammer is Justice. the 
swing of his Hammer: Mercy. / The force of Los’s Hammer is eternal 
Forgiveness,” 88.49-50). When a fragment is translated, it is not as 
obvious as when the whole is approached that one of the works of this 
hammer is <em>Jerusalem</em> itself, and that its beat must be heard 
throughout. Los would be as effective and efficient in Polish as he is 
in English if his instrument were one of the harps to which he is 
singing in <em>The Song of Los</em>, or if he went on singing the cradle
 song, or the watch song, or if he limited himself to operating the plow
 and running the winepress, or if he were an engraver drawing lines 
“upon the walls of shining heaven.” As a smith, Polish Los must remain 
inferior to the English original, because there is less force in the 
swing and the blow of his hammer.</p>
<p>Moreover, Blake’s punctuation causes immense difficulty. For example, Erdman’s pl. 16.3-7 reads:
</p><pre>                                                                                     in the Forests
The Oak frowns terrible, the Beech &amp; Ash &amp; Elm enroot&nbsp;
Among the Spiritual fires; loud the Corn fields thunder along
The Soldiers fife; the Harlots shriek; the Virgins dismal groan
The Parents fear: the Brothers jealousy: the Sisters curse ….</pre>
Should these lines be interpreted like this,
<pre>                                                                                     in the Forests
The Oak frowns terrible, the Beech &amp; Ash &amp; Elm enroot
Among the Spiritual fires; loud the Corn fields thunder along.&nbsp;
The Soldiers fife, the Harlots shriek, the Virgins dismal groan,
The Parents fear the Brother’s jealousy, the Sister’s curse ….</pre>
or, perhaps, in the following way?
<pre>                                                                                     in the Forests
The Oak frowns terrible, the Beech &amp; Ash &amp; Elm enroot
Among the Spiritual fires; loud the Corn fields thunder along
The Soldier’s fife, the Harlot’s shriek, the Virgin’s dismal groan,
The Parent’s fear, the Brother’s jealousy, the Sister’s curse ….</pre>
As a Blake scholar, I have always found Blake’s punctuation not really 
erratic, as it has so often been named (or, indeed, misnamed), but 
polyphonic. For this reason, as a critic, I rely on Erdman’s edition, 
because only in this edition is it possible to get what Blake’s original
 really offers: to see, for example, not only “the Parents fear” but 
also “the Parent’s fear” and “the Parents’ fear.” But the critic’s 
exhilaration becomes the translator’s frustration. Where the critic has 
the freedom to enjoy the activity and passivity, singularity and 
plurality combined into one brief phrase, the translator must constantly
 consult Keynes, Stevenson, Paley, or Solomon for their opinions and 
then reduce the original’s multitude and polyvocality, because certain 
reductions must be made: Polish, being a flectional language, has cases,
 and its genitive sounds totally different from its plural; it has no 
coincidence of verb and noun, etc. The only thing the translator can do 
is make a decision and follow one line of interpretation, and then, 
perhaps, account for the reduction in poetry in the prose of a footnote.
<p>Of course, this type of frustration is also the experience of Blake’s
 editors. What remains the vexation of the translator alone is the need 
to make certain indeterminacies determinate. To provide another—the 
last—illustration: on pl. 14.16-20, Blake writes:
</p><pre>And Los beheld his Sons, and he beheld his Daughters:
Every one a translucent Wonder: a Universe within,
Increasing inwards … 
                          … and they every one in their bright loins:
Have a beautiful golden gate ….</pre>
Does “every one” refer to the daughters and sons of Los, or to the 
daughters alone? This interpretative decision must be made because all 
possible Polish equivalents of “every one” will take one form when they 
refer to females alone, and another when they refer to a female-male 
group. Blake’s editors are of no help in this case, because they do not 
need to decide. Here, critics and commentators must become the 
translator’s guides, and the frustration comes when you need to weigh, 
for example, Paley’s and Doskow’s opinions (that the lines refer to the 
sons and daughters) versus Stevenson’s and Damon’s <span class="notecall">(that they refer to the daughters alone).</span><span class="sidenote">See Paley, <em>William Blake</em> 152, Doskow 56, Stevenson 686 (note to 14.16-24), and Damon 244.</span>
 Even more frustration comes when the only conclusion you can draw from 
reading and rereading Damon, Paley, Wicksteed, Dortort, Curran and 
Wittreich, Otto, Bloom, Doskow, Beer, and others is that nobody says 
anything about a given line or phrase or word. Of course, there is 
nothing surprising about it; there are hundreds of lines that have never
 received an illuminating commentary because, quite understandably, 
scholars focus on what is vital for their arguments. The difference 
between a critic and a translator is that for the latter each word, 
every minute particular, is vital.
<p>Nevertheless, despite these and hundreds of other difficulties, the 
frustration turns back to exhilaration when it transpires that, after 
all, Blake’s thought does yield to the Polish language. Juszczak and 
Słomczyński have demonstrated how effectively the type of difficulties 
enumerated above can be overcome and how vivid and suggestive, full of 
sublimity and pathos “Polish Blake” can be. Though the language does not
 have certain features which constitute the English language’s 
specificity and appeal, it does have attractions of its own, in 
particular immense musicality, flexibility, and openness to syntactic 
and semantic experiment. Perhaps the lines must remain slightly longer, 
but assonance, for example, by the vocal association of one word with 
another, will make them feel shorter. The modulation of Polish does not 
resemble the modulation of English, yet it makes a music of its own. The
 hammer of Los may need to become a slightly more musical hammer in the 
hand of a slightly more musical smith, yet it is capable of beating out a
 rhythm which pulsates powerfully enough to make the whole vibrant and 
energetic, fiery and passionate.</p>
<p>Still, despite this, <em>Jerusalem</em> exists only in the form of 
fragments. Poles have had no chance to wind the “golden string” into a 
ball, because the string is badly torn. Symptomatically, when 
translating pl. 77 (“To the Christians”), Miłosz started from “I know of
 no other Christianity”; in other words, he excluded the “golden string”
 motto, probably because it makes no sense when only a fragment is 
given. Fostowicz, on the other hand, did translate the motto along with 
the rest of the plate, but he made what seems a deliberate mistake by 
changing the tense; in his translation (as well as in the first 
paragraph of his foreword, where he quotes the “golden string” piece 
again), the motto reads not “I give you the end of a golden string” but 
“I will give you the end of a golden string” (5, 118 [2007]).</p>
<p>Although Fostowicz changed the original’s present tense into the 
future, it is quite doubtful, however, whether he really planned to give
 his audience the entire golden string sometime in the future. Before 
his death in 2010, he had conducted extensive correspondence with my 
collaborator, Rafał Stankiewicz. Fostowicz discussed every question and 
uncertainty with the fire of an artist and the patience of a scholar, 
yet never offered to join the project. Of course, one of his reasons 
might have been his involvement with other projects, including writing 
his massive <em>Boska analogia</em>. But another possible reason why he 
was not willing to engage in translating the entire text and why he 
chose to publish fragments rather than working on the whole may be 
recovered from a careful examination of the selection he offers in <em>Wiersze i pisma Williama Blake’a</em>.</p>
<p>He begins with the frontispiece, pl. 1, which is duly followed by pl.
 3, “To the Public.” Pl. 3, however, is not followed by pls. 4 and 5, 
etc., but by pls. 10.7-15.20, which he puts together under the title 
“Golgonooza.” As noted, Fostowicz claims in the first paragraph of his 
foreword that he “tried to select key … fragments of bigger wholes and 
put them together in a way that will make it possible for the 
uninitiated to understand the basic ideas [of Blake’s thought] and walk 
efficiently along his labyrinth” (5). The question that arises is why 
the translator who wanted to acquaint his reader with Blake’s “basic 
ideas” excluded the theme of <em>Jerusalem</em>, given in the opening of
 pl. 4. Even more importantly, why did he exclude the statement of 
Blake’s great task (“To open the Eternal Worlds, to open the immortal 
Eyes / Of Man …”) in pl. 5, which explains everything that follows, 
including Golgonooza? My guess is that Fostowicz’s intuition told him 
that what qualifies as a fair selection, fit to be offered to the Polish
 reader, are fragments which are not over-English.</p>
<p><em>Jerusalem</em>’s theme is specified in pl. 4, which is quite 
heavily loaded with English and Welsh place-names (“The Malvern and the 
Cheviot, the Wolds Plinlimmon &amp; Snowdon,” etc.). Even more 
radically, Blake’s great task is formulated in a paragraph that 
incorporates the list of the sons of Albion (“While I write of the 
building of Golgonooza, &amp; of the terrors of Entuthon: / Of Hand 
&amp; Hyle &amp; Coban, of Kwantok, Peachey, Brereton, Slayd &amp; 
Hutton”), which is followed by a list of four other sons (“Scofield! 
Kox, Kotope and Bowen”), and then by the catalogue of Albion’s daughters
 (5.41-45). By contrast, in 10.7-15.20, the longest uninterrupted 
passage in Fostowicz’s selection, there are only a handful of references
 to the individual sons and daughters (Sabrina and Ignoge in 11.19, 
Ragan and Scofield in 11.21, and Hand, Hyle, and Skofeld in 15.1-2). 
What is more, in this passage of 276 lines, London is the only 
conspicuous English place-name; apart from London, there are just brief 
references to Tyburn, Paddington, and Lambeth in the description of the 
building of Golgonooza.</p>
<p>To give a few more examples, this passage is followed by a pitifully 
brief extract (16.61-69), which the translator entitles “Los’s Halls.” 
Significantly, what is omitted is the highly English remainder of pl. 
16, which begins “Hampstead Highgate Finchley Hendon Muswell hill” and 
then, after Humber and Trent, Tweed and Tyne, along with Lincolnshire, 
Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Oxfordshire, and Norfolk, 
progresses to the enumeration of the counties of Wales, England, and 
Scotland. This elimination of the better part of the plate and the 
decision to give only its concluding paragraph as a fragment seem to be 
dictated by the same rationale that informs other choices and 
selections. Thus, the preface “To the Deists,” pl. 52, is followed by 
what Fostowicz calls “Plates 70-71.” The heading is misleading, however,
 as only the first nine lines of pl. 71 are given, and the thoroughly 
English remainder, beginning “And these the Names of Albions Twelve 
Sons, &amp; of his Twelve Daughters / With their Districts,” is not 
translated. Pls. 94-99, on the other hand, are translated, and form the 
second-longest uninterrupted passage of <em>Jerusalem</em> in 
Fostowicz’s anthology. In this passage of 176 lines, there is just one 
line that has English place-names (“Cornwall &amp; Derbyshire” in 94.8),
 and the sons and daughters of Albion are referred to only as a group. 
Preceding this relatively long extract is a passage entitled “Los’s 
Lament,” pls. 90.1-91.30. Pl. 90, translated in its entirety, is more 
English than most of the other passages in this selection. Among other 
things, line 40 contains a reference to four sons of Albion: “While in 
Selfhood Hand &amp; Hyle &amp; Bowen &amp; Skofeld appropriate / The 
Divine Names.” In Fostowicz’s translation, however, four become three, 
as he removes Bowen—a faithful translator for no apparent reason omits 
one of the four: “Samozapatrzenie w postaci Handa, Hyle’a i Skofelda …” 
(“Selfhood in the form of Hand, Hyle, and Skofeld …”; translation mine).
 One last telling detail is that a Blake dictionary that Fostowicz 
provides at the end of his book (287-97), while explaining the important
 places and characters of Blake’s myth—Allamanda, Beulah, Cathedron, 
Entuthon-Benython, Erin, Luban, Ahania, Bromion, Enion,&nbsp; Fuzon, 
Leutha, Oothoon, Orc, Palamabron, Rintrah, Theotormon, and many 
others—contains only Albion, Hand, Scofield, and Tyburn for English 
proper names. In other words, the selection from <em>Jerusalem</em> has been made in such a way that there is no need to explain any other English names.</p>
<p>In sum, a study of the most extensive collection of fragments from <em>Jerusalem</em>
 translated into Polish so far, particularly the logic behind what has 
been selected and what has been excluded, leads to the conclusion that <em>Jerusalem</em>
 might have been considered too English to be translated as a whole. 
Indeed, certain passages, such as the fixing of the counties in pl. 16, 
cannot be effectively naturalized into Polish. The way that Blake 
translates the map of the British Isles into rhythmic verse will never 
have the same effect on the Polish audience as it has on the British, 
because the names will remain largely unknown and because the ear of a 
Polish person who does not know English will not catch the rhythm 
(reading, for example, “-shire” not as a one-syllable but as a 
two-syllable word). The eye of a Polish reader, even one quite well 
acquainted with English, may spot the missing “w” in “Glasgo” in 16.57, 
but will probably not grasp all the other abbreviations that give this 
incantation the feel of a dictation hastily put down in shorthand. This 
may be explained in a footnote, but too many footnotes usually lead to a
 situation where none is read, which means in effect that a Polish 
person seeing the missing “w” in “Glasgo” will regard it as an editorial
 mistake.</p>
<p>On the other hand, similar catalogues are part of the biblical and of
 the epic conventions, which are as familiar to the educated Polish 
reader as to anybody. The reader will probably not grasp the specificity
 of Blake’s catalogue, but will understand enough to accept it as part 
of the entire prophecy. Besides, the proportion of such lines is so tiny
 that the text does not deserve to be fragmented only to spare the 
reader the difficulty of coping with such passages. In fact, the key to <em>Jerusalem</em>’s characters and places&nbsp;is largely to be found in <em>Jerusalem</em> itself; Damon’s <em>A Blake Dictionary</em>
 is, for the most part, a collection of quotations from Blake himself, 
both when it explains purely Blakean terms and when it defines Blake’s 
use of the names “Hand &amp; Hyle &amp; Bowen &amp; Skofeld,” etc. Then 
again, the names Cambel or Gwinefred, when heard for the first time, 
probably sound as empty to the ear of an English reader as they do to 
the Polish reader. Gwiniverra, on the other hand, sounds familiar 
(Hollywood productions know no national, cultural, or linguistic 
borders), and so do the names of Cordella, Gonorill, and Ragan 
(fortunately, Shakespeare knows no borders either). Thus, the first 
encounter with those characters may not be as perplexing for the reader 
as one might fear, and with each and every subsequent appearance of the 
daughters of Albion it becomes apparent that familiarity with the 
Arthurian romance or with <em>King Lear</em> does not offer much help in understanding their functions in <em>Jerusalem</em>,
 because they assume a narrative life of their own, they become part of 
the myth, very much like Ahania, Enion, Vala, or Enitharmon, <span class="notecall">or like Milton in <em>Milton</em>.</span><span class="sidenote">Actually <em>Milton</em>,
 which has been translated into Polish, requires much more background. 
To understand what Blake’s Milton does and says presupposes acquaintance
 with John Milton’s thought, attitude, and religious convictions, as 
well as with the style of <em>Paradise Lost</em>. But what Blake’s daughters of Albion say and do in <em>Jerusalem</em> will be perfectly understood without any acquaintance with Milton’s <em>History of Britain</em>, one of the sources from which Blake derived their names.</span> As a matter of fact, it is only if <em>Jerusalem</em>
 is offered as a whole that it can explain why it contains such a 
multitude of English references. It is only when it is allowed to tell 
its narrative that it can reveal that, on one level, the record of Los’s
 fight for his friend Albion is a record of Blake’s artistic fight for 
the country and the culture in which he lived and worked. And only when <em>Jerusalem</em>
 is allowed to unwind its story without interruption does it have a 
chance to disclose that, on another level, Los’s fight is universal, 
Blake’s Albion, the sleeping giant, is an Everyman, and, despite the 
multitude of English place-names, Albion is an everywhere, very much 
like Joyce’s apparently (and literally) thoroughly Irish Dublin.</p>
<p>In brief, my conviction is that <em>Jerusalem</em> seems much more 
confined within British culture, history, and geography when it is 
fragmented than when it is a “consolidated” work. A fragment that may be
 considered untranslatable becomes translatable when it stops being a 
fragment and has a chance to function as part of the whole.</p>
<p>Will Polish people take up the challenge that Blake’s <em>Jerusalem</em>
 offers? Of course I hope they will. However, hoping is a dubious thing 
in Polish; we do have an equivalent of the English “while there’s life 
there’s hope,” but there is also a nasty Polish proverb that says “hope 
is the mother of fools.” Let me therefore conclude not on what I hope 
for but on what I know: it is impossible to determine whether Poles will
 take up the challenge of <em>Jerusalem</em> until the challenge of the entire text is offered.</p>
